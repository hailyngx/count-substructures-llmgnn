Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 15) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 15) (9, 14) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 18) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (18, 3) (18, 19) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 19) (12, 16) (12, 7) (12, 0) (0, 1) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 4) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 15) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 7) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 7-5-9-6-7
- Cycle 2: 11-16-6-1-11
- Cycle 3: 13-15-16-6-13
- Cycle 4: 4-13-15-5-4

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: 7-5-9-6-7 has no chord.
- Cycle 2: 11-16-6-1-11 has no chord.
- Cycle 3: 13-15-16-6-13 has a chord 15-6.
- Cycle 4: 4-13-15-5-4 has no chord.

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

The unique chordal 4-cycle is <1, (15-6), 13>.
