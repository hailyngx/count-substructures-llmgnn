<27, 7, 21, 1> 
<28, 11, 15, 26> 
<29, 25, 20, 24> 

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
<<13, 0, 4, 7>, (13, 7)> 
<<1, 21, 7, 4>, (1, 4)> 
<<1, 21, 26, 15>, (1, 15)> 
<<1, 21, 26, 17>, (1, 17)> 
<<1, 21, 26, 14>, (1, 14)> 
<<3, 20, 24, 15>, (3, 15)> 
<<3, 20, 24, 9>, (3, 9)> 
<<8, 2, 1, 21>, (8, 21)> 
<<14, 26, 15, 24>, (14, 24)> 

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [9].
