Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 5) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 4) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 9) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- (0, 3, 5, 2, 0)
- (0, 3, 6, 4, 9, 11, 10, 0)
- (1, 7, 12, 9, 4, 3, 5, 10, 11, 14, 8, 1)
- (3, 5, 13, 12, 8, 14, 11, 9, 4, 6, 0)
- (4, 6, 3, 9, 12, 7, 14, 11, 10, 0)
- (5, 13, 7, 1, 8, 14, 4, 6, 0, 2)
- (9, 12, 7, 14, 11, 4, 6, 3)


Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <0, (3, 5), 2, 0>
- <0, (3, 6), 4, 9, 11, 10, 0>
- <1, 7, (12, 9), 4, 3, 5, 10, 11, 14, 8, 1>
- <3, 5, (13, 12), 8, 14, 11, 9, 4, 6, 0>
- <4, 6, (3, 9), 12, 7, 14, 11, 10, 0>
- <5, (13, 7), 1, 8, 14, 4, 6, 0, 2>
- <9, (12, 7), 14, 11, 4, 6, 3>


Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final count is [7].
