Step 2:
- Among the cycles listed:
<14, 17, 18, 11> has exactly one chord (edges 17-18).
<4, 8, 7, 9> has exactly one chord (edges 4-8).
<4, 6, 13, 6> has exactly one chord (edges 4-13).
<8, 10, 16, 3> has exactly one chord (edges 10-16).
<1, 9, 7, 8> has exactly one chord (edges 7-9).
<0, 8, 7, 9> has exactly one chord (edges 7-8).
<0, 16, 2, 9> has exactly one chord (edges 2-16).
<0, 3, 4, 17> has exactly one chord (edges 4-17).
<15, 19, 15, 12> has exactly one chord (edges 12-19).
<3, 4, 17, 18> has exactly one chord (edges 4-17).
<5, 14, 17, 18> has exactly one chord (edges 14-17).
<12, 15, 19, 15> has exactly one chord (edges 15-19).
<13, 1, 0, 8> has exactly one chord (edges 1-8).

Step 3:
- There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
- So, the number of chordless 4-cycles is [13].
