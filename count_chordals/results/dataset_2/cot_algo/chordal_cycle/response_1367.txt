Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1 - 6 - 5 - 13 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 6 - 4 - 11 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 6 - 4 - 7 - 0 - 12 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 9 - 7 - 4 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 5: 3 - 1 - 6 - 5 - 13 - 3
- Cycle 6: 3 - 1 - 6 - 4 - 11 - 3
- Cycle 7: 3 - 1 - 9 - 7 - 4 - 11 - 3
- Cycle 8: 3 - 4 - 6 - 5 - 13 - 3
- Cycle 9: 4 - 6 - 5 - 13 - 11 - 4
- Cycle 10: 4 - 7 - 0 - 12 - 10 - 4
- Cycle 11: 7 - 9 - 1 - 6 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 12: 13 - 8 - 1 - 6 - 5 - 13
- Cycle 13: 13 - 8 - 1 - 9 - 7 - 4 - 11 - 13
- Cycle 14: 14 - 3 - 1 - 6 - 4 - 14
- Cycle 15: 14 - 3 - 4 - 11 - 2 - 14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 13) 
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (4, 11)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (0, 12) 
- Cycle 4 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (6, 5)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (6, 4)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (4, 6) 
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (6, 5) 
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (0, 12)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (5, 13) 
- Cycle 13 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 14 has one chord: (6, 4) 
- Cycle 15 has one chord: (3, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
<1, (5, 13), 6, 8>
<2, (4, 11), 6, 1>
<3, (0, 12), 6, 4>
<5, (6, 5), 3, 1>
<6, (6, 4), 3, 1>
<7, (9, 7), 1, 4>
<9, (6, 5), 4, 6>
<10, (0, 12), 4, 7>
<14, (6, 4), 3, 14>
