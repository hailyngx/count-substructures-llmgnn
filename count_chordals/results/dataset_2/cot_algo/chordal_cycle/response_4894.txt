Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-1-4-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-3-0-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-0-7-5
- Cycle 4: 5-9-1-6-5
- Cycle 5: 5-3-0-7-5
- Cycle 6: 5-3-9-1-5
- Cycle 7: 5-3-0-4-5
- Cycle 8: 5-0-4-6-5
- Cycle 9: 5-0-7-1-5
- Cycle 10: 5-0-4-1-5
- Cycle 11: 5-0-7-8-5
- Cycle 12: 5-2-1-6-5
- Cycle 13: 5-2-8-6-5
- Cycle 14: 5-2-8-7-5

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3 (5-9-0-7-5) has exactly one chord: (9, 7) 

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, which is <3, (9, 7)>. Therefore, the final count is [1].
