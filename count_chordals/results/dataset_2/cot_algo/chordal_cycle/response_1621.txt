- Cycle 3: (25, 0, 23, 4, 25)
- Cycle 4: (25, 18, 27, 13, 25)
- Cycle 5: (10, 9, 22, 28, 10)
- Cycle 6: (17, 27, 18, 25, 17)
- Cycle 7: (14, 12, 16, 10, 14)
- Cycle 8: (14, 20, 24, 3, 14)
- Cycle 9: (14, 0, 23, 4, 14)
- Cycle 10: (14, 11, 21, 26, 14)
- Cycle 11: (1, 29, 21, 11, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 29, 19, 13, 1)
- Cycle 13: (1, 26, 21, 11, 1)
- Cycle 14: (1, 13, 27, 18, 1)
- Cycle 15: (9, 10, 16, 12, 9)
- Cycle 16: (9, 22, 28, 10, 9)
- Cycle 17: (19, 28, 22, 9, 19)
- Cycle 18: (19, 29, 1, 13, 19)
- Cycle 19: (19, 29, 21, 11, 19)
- Cycle 20: (19, 3, 24, 20, 19)
- Cycle 21: (2, 6, 26, 21, 2)
- Cycle 22: (3, 9, 22, 6, 3)
- Cycle 23: (3, 24, 20, 14, 3)
- Cycle 24: (11, 14, 0, 23, 11)
- Cycle 25: (12, 16, 10, 9, 12)
- Cycle 26: (21, 26, 6, 2, 21)
- Cycle 27: (13, 1, 29, 19, 13)
- Cycle 28: (13, 27, 18, 25, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (13, 19), 4, 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (21, 11), 14, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (22, 9), 10, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (22, 28), 10, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, (24, 20), 14, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, (22, 28), 10, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <9, (22, 6), 2, 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <13, (27, 18), 25, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
