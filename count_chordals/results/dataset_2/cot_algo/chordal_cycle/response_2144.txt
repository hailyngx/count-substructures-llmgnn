Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 7) (6, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-5-9-1
- Cycle 3: 3-4-9-0-3
- Cycle 4: 10-11-8-12-10
- Cycle 5: 10-14-2-12-10
- Cycle 6: 5-11-13-9-5
- Cycle 7: 5-7-0-14-5
- Cycle 8: 13-12-2-14-13

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 <1, (3, 5), 1>
- Cycle 2 <1, (6, 9), 1>
- Cycle 3 <3, (4, 9), 3>
- Cycle 4 <10, (11, 8), 10>
- Cycle 5 <10, (14, 2), 10>
- Cycle 6 <5, (11, 9), 5>
- Cycle 7 <5, (7, 14), 5>
- Cycle 8 <13, (12, 2), 13>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
