Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 3) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (6, 1, 4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 13, 14, 6)
- Cycle 3: (9, 2, 10, 9)
- Cycle 4: (10, 11, 12, 10)
- Cycle 5: (11, 3, 14, 11)
- Cycle 6: (4, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 12, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 5, 0, 4)
- Cycle 9: (8, 4, 1, 8)
- Cycle 10: (8, 2, 7, 8)
- Cycle 11: (7, 8, 4, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 2, 10, 7)
- Cycle 13: (12, 11, 3, 12)
- Cycle 14: (12, 8, 7, 12)
- Cycle 15: (2, 9, 1, 2)
- Cycle 16: (2, 10, 5, 2)
- Cycle 17: (0, 4, 5, 0)
- Cycle 18: (0, 14, 3, 0)
- Cycle 19: (14, 12, 8, 14)
- Cycle 20: (14, 0, 5, 14)
- Cycle 21: (3, 9, 2, 3)
- Cycle 22: (3, 10, 11, 3)
- Cycle 23: (1, 6, 13, 1)
- Cycle 24: (1, 7, 8, 1)
- Cycle 25: (13, 6, 4, 13)
- Cycle 26: (13, 14, 0, 13)
- Cycle 27: (5, 10, 2, 5)
- Cycle 28: (5, 4, 1, 5)
- Cycle 29: (5, 7, 8, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6, (13, 14), 4, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <10, (11, 12), 3, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (5, 0), 8, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, (7, 10), 2, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <12, (8, 7), 11, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <14, (0, 13), 5, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <2, (9, 1), 10, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <0, (5, 14), 4, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <3, (14, 13), 10, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <1, (6, 13), 4, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [10].
