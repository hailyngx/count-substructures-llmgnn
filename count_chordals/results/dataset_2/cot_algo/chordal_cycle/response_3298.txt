Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 16) (3, 8) (15, 12) (15, 2) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 1) (14, 4) (14, 12) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (5, 1) (5, 2) (12, 15) (12, 7) (12, 14) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 10) (8, 3) (8, 19) (8, 10) (8, 16) (0, 4) (0, 17) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 8) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 11) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 13) (13, 16) (13, 11) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1-9-6-7-1
- Cycle 2: 2-5-1-9-6-2
- Cycle 3: 2-5-1-7-4-10-2
- Cycle 4: 2-5-1-7-4-0-17-16-2
- Cycle 5: 10-4-7-6-11-13-16-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 7, 10, 2> has exactly one chord: (7, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
