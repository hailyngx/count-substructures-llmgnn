Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 10) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 2)

21. Cycle <0, 13, 8, 9, 12, 6, 14, 5, 7, 12, 3, 0>
22. Cycle <0, 13, 8, 9, 12, 6, 14, 5, 7, 3, 0>
23. Cycle <0, 13, 8, 9, 12, 6, 14, 13, 2, 4, 0>
24. Cycle <0, 13, 8, 9, 12, 6, 14, 13, 2, 11, 0>
25. Cycle <0, 13, 8, 9, 12, 6, 14, 13, 3, 0>
26. Cycle <0, 13, 8, 9, 12, 6, 14, 7, 5, 3, 0>
27. Cycle <0, 3, 8, 9, 10, 4, 2, 13, 0>
28. Cycle <0, 3, 8, 9, 10, 4, 2, 11, 0>
29. Cycle <0, 3, 8, 9, 12, 7, 5, 14, 6, 0>
30. Cycle <0, 3, 8, 9, 12, 6, 14, 5, 7, 13, 0>
31. Cycle <0, 3, 8, 9, 12, 6, 14, 13, 2, 4, 0>
32. Cycle <0, 3, 8, 9, 12, 6, 14, 13, 2, 11, 0>
33. Cycle <0, 3, 8, 9, 12, 6, 14, 13, 3, 0>
34. Cycle <0, 11, 9, 10, 4, 2, 13, 0>
35. Cycle <0, 11, 9, 10, 4, 2, 3, 12, 7, 5, 14, 6, 13, 8, 0>
36. Cycle <0, 11, 9, 12, 7, 5, 8, 13, 14, 6, 12, 3, 2, 4, 10, 1, 0>
37. Cycle <0, 11, 9, 12, 7, 5, 8, 13, 14, 6, 12, 3, 6, 14, 13, 3, 2, 4, 10, 1, 0>
38. Cycle <0, 11, 9, 12, 7, 5, 14, 13, 8, 3, 2, 4, 10, 1, 0>

40. Cycle <0, 11, 9, 12, 6, 12, 7, 5, 8, 13, 14, 6, 14, 13, 2, 4, 10, 1, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

From the above list, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 4, 10, 1, 9, 12, 7, 5, 8, 3, 0> with the chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes) being (1, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There is only one chordal 4-cycle found, so the count is [1].
