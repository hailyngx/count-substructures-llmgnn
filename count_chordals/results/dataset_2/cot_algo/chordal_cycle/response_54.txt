Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 10) (15, 1) (15, 17) (14, 0) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 4) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 5) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (9, 16) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 19) (9, 12) (18, 19) (19, 2) (19, 9) (19, 18) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (12, 16) (12, 9) (12, 13) (7, 17) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (6, 7) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (4, 16) (4, 2) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, we cannot proceed to find chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
