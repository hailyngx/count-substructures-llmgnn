Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 5-1-4-6-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-7-3-5
- Cycle 3: 5-4-8-6-5
- Cycle 4: 5-6-8-3-5
- Cycle 5: 5-4-2-7-5
- Cycle 6: 9-7-2-3-9
- Cycle 7: 9-0-6-8-9
- Cycle 8: 6-4-1-0-6
- Cycle 9: 1-2-7-5-1
- Cycle 10: 4-2-7-3-4
- Cycle 11: 8-3-2-7-8
- Cycle 12: 2-1-5-9-2
- Cycle 13: 7-5-1-0-7

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 6), 5> with chords 4 and 6
- <1, (5, 2), 1> with chords 5 and 2
- <4, (1, 7), 5> with chords 1 and 7
- <4, (2, 3), 4> with chords 2 and 3
- <7, (3, 2), 5> with chords 3 and 2

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [5].
