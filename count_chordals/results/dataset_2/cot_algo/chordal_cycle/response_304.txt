        - Cycle 22: (9, 6, 2, 18, 9)
        - Cycle 23: (9, 6, 2, 18, 9)
        - Cycle 24: (9, 6, 2, 18, 9)
        - Cycle 25: (9, 15, 11, 19, 9)
        - Cycle 26: (9, 15, 11, 19, 9)
        - Cycle 27: (9, 15, 11, 19, 9)
        - Cycle 28: (10, 17, 18, 13, 10)
        - Cycle 29: (10, 17, 18, 13, 10)
        - Cycle 30: (10, 17, 18, 13, 10)
        - Cycle 31: (11, 15, 9, 6, 11)
        - Cycle 32: (11, 15, 9, 6, 11)
        - Cycle 33: (11, 15, 9, 6, 11)
        - Cycle 34: (14, 7, 3, 5, 14)
        - Cycle 35: (14, 7, 3, 5, 14)
        - Cycle 36: (14, 7, 3, 5, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (13, 18), 2, 1>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (13, 16), 0, 1>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (13, 12), 5, 1>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, (7, 14), 7, 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, (10, 17), 18, 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, (12, 13), 16, 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6, (2, 18), 17, 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <9, (6, 2), 18, 9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (15, 11), 19, 9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, (17, 18), 13, 10>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <11, (15, 9), 6, 11>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <14, (7, 3), 5, 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 36 cycles in total.

        Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [12].
