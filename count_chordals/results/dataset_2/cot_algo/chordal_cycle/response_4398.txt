Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 7) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 1) (11, 18) (11, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 6) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 11) (18, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (7, 17) (7, 13) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 19) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 16) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 13) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 15) (13, 19) (19, 16) (19, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 2, 8, 6, 4, 9>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 2, 12, 14, 1, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 16, 12, 14, 1, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 16, 19, 13, 3, 1, 5>
- Cycle 5: <17, 18, 11, 8, 6, 0, 3, 1, 14, 17>
- Cycle 6: <17, 18, 11, 8, 2, 12, 14, 17>
- Cycle 7: <17, 18, 4, 6, 0, 3, 1, 14, 17>
- Cycle 8: <17, 18, 4, 6, 8, 2, 12, 14, 17>
- Cycle 9: <17, 14, 1, 3, 0, 6, 4, 18, 17>
- Cycle 10: <17, 14, 1, 3, 13, 7, 17>
- Cycle 11: <17, 15, 13, 3, 0, 6, 4, 18, 17>
- Cycle 12: <17, 15, 13, 3, 1, 14, 12, 2, 8, 11, 18, 17>
- Cycle 13: <17, 15, 5, 1, 3, 0, 6, 8, 11, 18, 17>
- Cycle 14: <16, 12, 14, 1, 3, 0, 6, 4, 9, 2, 8, 11, 18, 17, 15>
- Cycle 15: <16, 12, 2, 8, 6, 0, 3, 1, 14, 17, 18, 4, 9, 16>
- Cycle 16: <16, 12, 2, 8, 11, 18, 17, 15, 13, 7, 17, 14, 1, 5, 15>
- Cycle 17: <19, 16, 12, 2, 8, 6, 0, 3, 1, 14, 17, 18, 11, 8, 2, 9, 4, 6, 0, 6, 4, 9, 5, 15, 13, 7, 17, 14, 12, 16, 19>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (9, 2)
- Cycle 2 has chord (9, 2)
- Cycle 3 has chord (9, 16)
- Cycle 4 has chord (9, 16)
- Cycle 5 has chord (8, 2)
- Cycle 6 has chord (8, 2)
- Cycle 7 has chord (8, 6)
- Cycle 8 has chord (8, 6)
- Cycle 9 has chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 10 has chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 11 has chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 12 has chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 13 has chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 14 has chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 15 has chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 16 has chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 17 has chord (5, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 17 cycles with one chord present, so the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [17]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, 9, 2, 8, 6, 4, 9>.
