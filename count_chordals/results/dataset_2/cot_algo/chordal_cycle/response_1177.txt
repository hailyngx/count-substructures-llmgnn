Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 5) (11, 4) (11, 9) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<0, 1, 6, 13>
<0, 1, 7, 9>
<0, 1, 9, 12>
<0, 4, 8, 12>
<0, 4, 11, 9>
<1, 6, 12, 8>
<1, 7, 0, 4>
<1, 7, 9, 12>
<2, 6, 12, 8>
<2, 10, 14, 13>
<3, 5, 0, 4>
<3, 5, 10, 14>
<3, 8, 12, 2>
<4, 8, 12, 6>
<5, 0, 4, 8>
<5, 3, 8, 12>
<6, 1, 7, 0>
<6, 1, 9, 12>
<7, 0, 4, 8>
<7, 1, 6, 13>
<9, 7, 0, 4>
<9, 7, 1, 6>
<9, 11, 4, 8>
<9, 12, 8, 4>
<10, 2, 6, 12>
<10, 2, 14, 13>
<10, 3, 5, 0>
<10, 3, 8, 12>
<10, 14, 8, 12>
<11, 4, 8, 12>
<12, 8, 4, 0>
<12, 9, 7, 0>
<13, 6, 1, 7>
<13, 14, 10, 3>
<13, 14, 8, 4>
<14, 2, 6, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycle found:
<[1, 6, 12, 8], (1, 12)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
