Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 10) (9, 7) (26, 9) (26, 18) (26, 21) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 20) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 14) (18, 26) (18, 22) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 12) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 24) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 24) (23, 25) (23, 6) (23, 13) (0, 20) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 2) (20, 4) (20, 0) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 21) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 24) (17, 5) (5, 17) (5, 19) (19, 22) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 5) (29, 0) (29, 14) (3, 21) (3, 24) (3, 6) (21, 26) (21, 15) (21, 3) (12, 4) (12, 22) (12, 25) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 27) (2, 4) (2, 22) (2, 11) (2, 0) (24, 11) (24, 8) (24, 0) (24, 17) (24, 3) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 29) (6, 7) (6, 23) (6, 3) (27, 1) (27, 28) (25, 23) (25, 12) (13, 11) (13, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <4, 7, 9, 10> with chord (7, 10)
- Cycle 2: <4, 2, 11, 10> with chord (2, 11)
- Cycle 3: <4, 2, 22, 18> with chord (2, 18)
- Cycle 4: <4, 20, 0, 24> with chord (20, 24)
- Cycle 5: <7, 4, 12, 22> with chord (4, 22)
- Cycle 6: <7, 14, 29, 0> with chord (14, 29)
- Cycle 7: <9, 26, 18, 22> with chord (26, 22)
- Cycle 8: <9, 7, 6, 23> with chord (7, 23)
- Cycle 9: <10, 11, 19, 22> with chord (11, 22)
- Cycle 10: <11, 2, 0, 24> with chord (2, 24)
- Cycle 11: <24, 0, 20, 4> with chord (0, 4)
- Cycle 12: <24, 17, 5, 19> with chord (17, 19)
- Cycle 13: <26, 21, 15, 17> with chord (21, 17)
- Cycle 14: <22, 19, 1, 17> with chord (19, 17)
- Cycle 15: <6, 7, 4, 2> with chord (7, 2)
- Cycle 16: <6, 23, 25, 12> with chord (23, 12)
- Cycle 17: <15, 21, 26, 18> with chord (21, 18)
- Cycle 18: <12, 4, 20, 0> with chord (4, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <4, 7, 9, 10, (7, 10)>
- <4, 2, 11, 10, (2, 11)>
- <4, 2, 22, 18, (2, 18)>
- <4, 20, 0, 24, (20, 24)>
- <7, 4, 12, 22, (4, 22)>
- <7, 14, 29, 0, (14, 29)>
- <9, 26, 18, 22, (26, 22)>
- <9, 7, 6, 23, (7, 23)>
- <10, 11, 19, 22, (11, 22)>
- <11, 2, 0, 24, (2, 24)>
- <24, 0, 20, 4, (0, 4)>
- <24, 17, 5, 19, (17, 19)>
- <26, 21, 15, 17, (21, 17)>
- <22, 19, 1, 17, (19, 17)>
- <6, 7, 4, 2, (7, 2)>
- <6, 23, 25, 12, (23, 12)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found

There are 16 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count is [16].
