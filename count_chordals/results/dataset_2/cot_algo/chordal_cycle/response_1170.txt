Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 18) (18, 8) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 0) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 16) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 2) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 14) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 18) (0, 3) (16, 18) (16, 13) (16, 12) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 19) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 0) (7, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 17) (19, 1) (19, 6) (19, 14) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 12) (17, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (10, 15, 5, 1, 10)
- Cycle 2: (10, 7, 10)
- Cycle 3: (11, 9, 2, 15, 12, 11)
- Cycle 4: (4, 8, 18, 16, 13, 5, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 13, 16, 18, 8, 4, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 6: (15, 10, 7, 10, 15)
- Cycle 7: (15, 12, 16, 13, 5, 15)
- Cycle 8: (9, 11, 10, 15, 2, 9)
- Cycle 9: (12, 4, 8, 18, 16, 13, 12)
- Cycle 10: (0, 4, 8, 18, 16, 13, 5, 3, 0)
- Cycle 11: (16, 18, 8, 4, 6, 19, 14, 9, 16)
- Cycle 12: (1, 5, 3, 0, 4, 6, 19, 1)
- Cycle 13: (7, 10, 15, 2, 9, 14, 19, 6, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <1, (5, 15), 5>
- <2, (9, 15), 2>
- <4, (8, 16), 4>
- <5, (3, 13), 5>
- <6, (4, 19), 6>
- <7, (10, 15), 7>
- <9, (2, 11), 9>
- <10, (15, 10), 10>
- <12, (4, 13), 12>
- <13, (16, 18), 13>
- <14, (9, 19), 14>
- <16, (0, 18), 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles. So, the final count is [13].
