Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 15) (6, 18) (6, 16) (1, 17) (1, 10) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 16) (4, 15) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 12) (14, 12) (14, 2) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 15) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 18) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 19) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 13) (15, 16) (16, 6) (16, 4) (16, 15) (18, 6) (18, 17) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 2) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 3, 10, 13> with edges (0, 3), (3, 10), (10, 13), (13, 0).
- Cycle <0, 7, 5, 8> with edges (0, 7), (7, 5), (5, 8), (8, 0).
- Cycle <1, 10, 13, 2> with edges (1, 10), (10, 13), (13, 2), (2, 1).
- Cycle <4, 8, 7, 19> with edges (4, 8), (8, 7), (7, 19), (19, 4).
- Cycle <4, 10, 13, 15> with edges (4, 10), (10, 13), (13, 15), (15, 4).
- Cycle <4, 11, 4, 8> with edges (4, 11), (11, 4), (4, 8), (8, 4).
- Cycle <12, 0, 3, 10> with edges (12, 0), (0, 3), (3, 10), (10, 12).
- Cycle <12, 0, 7, 19> with edges (12, 0), (0, 7), (7, 19), (19, 12).
- Cycle <12, 2, 13, 15> with edges (12, 2), (2, 13), (13, 15), (15, 12).

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycle <0, 3, 10, 13> has one chord (3, 10).
The cycle <1, 10, 13, 2> has one chord (10, 2).
The cycle <4, 8, 7, 19> has one chord (8, 7).
The cycle <4, 10, 13, 15> has one chord (10, 15).
The cycle <12, 0, 3, 10> has one chord (0, 3).
The cycle <12, 0, 7, 19> has one chord (0, 7).
The cycle <12, 2, 13, 15> has one chord (13, 15).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 3, 10, 13>
<1, 10, 13, 2>
<4, 8, 7, 19>
<4, 10, 13, 15>
<12, 0, 3, 10>
<12, 0, 7, 19>
<12, 2, 13, 15>
