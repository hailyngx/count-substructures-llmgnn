Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (0, 6, 4, 1, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 6, 4, 3, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 2, 5, 6, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 2, 5, 8, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 2, 9, 8, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 7, 4, 3, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 7, 4, 6, 0)
- Cycle 8: (1, 4, 6, 5, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 4, 7, 9, 1)
- Cycle 10: (2, 0, 6, 5, 2)
- Cycle 11: (3, 4, 6, 5, 3)
- Cycle 12: (3, 4, 7, 9, 3)

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (0, 8).
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (0, 2).
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (4, 7).
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (4, 6).
- Cycle 10 has no chord.
- Cycle 11 has no chord.
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (4, 9).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, which are:
<0, 8, 6, 4, 0>, chord: (0, 8)
<0, 2, 7, 4, 0>, chord: (0, 2)
<1, 4, 6, 7, 1>, chord: (4, 7)
<1, 4, 9, 7, 1>, chord: (4, 9)

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
