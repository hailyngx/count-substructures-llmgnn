Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 13) (5, 11) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 17) (9, 0) (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 2) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 17) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 0) (13, 16) (13, 3) (13, 2) (17, 16) (17, 5) (17, 9) (17, 18) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (1, 7) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 12) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 7) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 1) (7, 14) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- (5, 11, 16, 17)
- (3, 13, 16, 17)
- (4, 5, 9, 17)
- (2, 12, 3, 13)
- (0, 6, 9, 5)
- (14, 3, 13, 2)
- (7, 1, 14, 10)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- (5, 11, 16, 17) has a chord (11, 17)
- (3, 13, 16, 17) has a chord (3, 17)
- (4, 5, 9, 17) has a chord (5, 9)
- (2, 12, 3, 13) has a chord (12, 13)
- (0, 6, 9, 5) has a chord (6, 9)
- (14, 3, 13, 2) has a chord (3, 13)
- (7, 1, 14, 10) has a chord (1, 14)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Hence, the unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is:
<5, 11, 16, 17>
