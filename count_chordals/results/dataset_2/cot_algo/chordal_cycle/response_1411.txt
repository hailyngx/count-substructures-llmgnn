Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 10) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 16) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) (15, 12) (9, 8) (9, 2) (18, 8) (18, 10) (18, 19) (19, 18) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 1) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 12) (17, 15) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 17) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (12, 8) (12, 15) (12, 3) (12, 17) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 11-16-4-1-11
- Cycle 2: 11-16-10-18-11
- Cycle 3: 11-2-5-1-11
- Cycle 4: 16-10-15-17-16
- Cycle 5: 16-4-8-9-16
- Cycle 6: 16-4-1-5-16
- Cycle 7: 16-10-18-19-16
- Cycle 8: 4-8-12-15-4
- Cycle 9: 4-8-6-14-4
- Cycle 10: 4-1-5-2-4
- Cycle 11: 8-9-2-5-8
- Cycle 12: 8-9-2-11-8
- Cycle 13: 8-12-15-17-8
- Cycle 14: 8-12-3-17-8
- Cycle 15: 8-6-14-7-8
- Cycle 16: 8-6-17-12-8
- Cycle 17: 8-18-10-15-8
- Cycle 18: 0-14-6-17-0
- Cycle 19: 0-14-7-8-0
- Cycle 20: 10-15-12-17-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <1, 16, 5, (3), 2)>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 19 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
