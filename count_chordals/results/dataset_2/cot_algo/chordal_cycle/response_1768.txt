Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 10) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (12, 9) (12, 11) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 5) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: <1, 6, 9, 1>
        - Cycle 2: <1, 2, 8, 7, 5, 10, 3, 0, 13, 4, 9, 1>
        - Cycle 3: <2, 11, 12, 9, 4, 13, 0, 3, 10, 5, 7, 8, 2>
        - Cycle 4: <3, 6, 1, 2, 11, 0, 13, 4, 11, 12, 9, 6, 3>
        - Cycle 5: <3, 4, 13, 8, 2, 1, 6, 9, 12, 11, 0, 10, 3>
        - Cycle 6: <4, 13, 0, 11, 2, 1, 6, 9, 12, 11, 4>
        - Cycle 7: <5, 7, 8, 2, 1, 6, 9, 12, 11, 10, 5>
        - Cycle 8: <6, 1, 2, 8, 7, 5, 10, 3, 4, 9, 6>
        - Cycle 9: <7, 4, 13, 0, 11, 2, 8, 7>
        - Cycle 10: <10, 7, 5, 10>
        - Cycle 11: <11, 0, 13, 4, 9, 12, 11>
        - Cycle 12: <12, 9, 1, 2, 8, 7, 10, 3, 0, 13, 4, 12>
        - Cycle 13: <13, 0, 3, 10, 5, 7, 8, 2, 11, 4, 13>
        - Cycle 14: <14, 6, 9, 12, 11, 2, 10, 5, 7, 4, 13, 0, 3, 1, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, 6, 9, 1>: Chord (6, 9)
        - <1, 2, 8, 7, 5, 10, 3, 0, 13, 4, 9, 1>: Chord (8, 9)
        - <2, 11, 12, 9, 4, 13, 0, 3, 10, 5, 7, 8, 2>: Chord (11, 12)
        - <3, 6, 1, 2, 11, 0, 13, 4, 11, 12, 9, 6, 3>: Chord (1, 11)
        - <3, 4, 13, 8, 2, 1, 6, 9, 12, 11, 0, 10, 3>: Chord (4, 8)
        - <4, 13, 0, 11, 2, 1, 6, 9, 12, 11, 4>: Chord (0, 11)
        - <5, 7, 8, 2, 1, 6, 9, 12, 11, 10, 5>: Chord (7, 2)
        - <6, 1, 2, 8, 7, 5, 10, 3, 4, 9, 6>: Chord (1, 8)
        - <7, 4, 13, 0, 11, 2, 8, 7>: Chord (4, 8)
        - <10, 7, 5, 10>: Chord (5, 7)
        - <11, 0, 13, 4, 9, 12, 11>: Chord (0, 9)
        - <12, 9, 1, 2, 8, 7, 10, 3, 0, 13, 4, 12>: Chord (1, 8)
        - <13, 0, 3, 10, 5, 7, 8, 2, 11, 4, 13>: Chord (0, 3)
        - <14, 6, 9, 12, 11, 2, 10, 5, 7, 4, 13, 0, 3, 1, 14>: Chord (6, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        - There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
        - Therefore, the final count is [14].
