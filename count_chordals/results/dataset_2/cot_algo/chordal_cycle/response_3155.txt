Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-7-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-5-9-3-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-8-7-2-3-0
- Cycle 4: 0-6-7-4-3-0
- Cycle 5: 1-0-4-3-2-1
- Cycle 6: 2-7-4-3-9-2
- Cycle 7: 3-4-9-2-7-3
- Cycle 8: 4-3-9-2-7-4
- Cycle 9: 5-1-8-7-4-5
- Cycle 10: 6-7-4-9-3-6

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <2, (8, 7)>
- Cycle 2: No chord
- Cycle 3: <3, (2, 7)>
- Cycle 4: <4, (7, 0)>
- Cycle 5: No chord
- Cycle 6: No chord
- Cycle 7: No chord
- Cycle 8: No chord
- Cycle 9: <5, (8, 4)>
- Cycle 10: <6, (9, 3)>

Step 3: Counting chordal 4-cycles:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord each. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [6]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <2, (8, 7)>
2. <3, (2, 7)>
3. <4, (7, 0)>
4. <5, (8, 4)>
5. <6, (9, 3)>
