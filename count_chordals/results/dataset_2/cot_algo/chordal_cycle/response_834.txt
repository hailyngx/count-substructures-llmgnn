Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 3, 8)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 7, 0)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 2, 6)
- Cycle 5: (5, 7, 1, 0)
- Cycle 6: (5, 7, 4, 6)
- Cycle 7: (5, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 8: (9, 4, 6, 8)
- Cycle 9: (9, 4, 7, 0)
- Cycle 10: (9, 4, 0, 1)
- Cycle 11: (9, 7, 1, 0)
- Cycle 12: (4, 7, 1, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <5, (9, 4), 6> ❌
- Cycle 2: <5, (9, 3), 8> ❌
- Cycle 3: <5, (9, 7), 0> ✅
- Cycle 4: <5, (9, 2), 6> ✅
- Cycle 5: <5, (7, 1), 0> ❌
- Cycle 6: <5, (7, 4), 6> ✅
- Cycle 7: <5, (7, 0), 1> ❌
- Cycle 8: <9, (4, 6), 8> ❌
- Cycle 9: <9, (4, 7), 0> ❌
- Cycle 10: <9, (4, 0), 1> ❌
- Cycle 11: <9, (7, 1), 0> ❌
- Cycle 12: <4, (7, 1), 0> ❌

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are: <5, (9, 7), 0>, <5, (9, 2), 6>, <5, (7, 4), 6>, <5, (7, 0), 1>
