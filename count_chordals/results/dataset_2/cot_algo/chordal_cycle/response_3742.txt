The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 16) (15, 9) (15, 29) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 23) (0, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (25, 1) (25, 21) (25, 11) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 28) (13, 7) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 24) (12, 11) (20, 29) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 28) (21, 25) (21, 19) (21, 26) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 1) (26, 21) (26, 14) (29, 15) (29, 20) (29, 9) (29, 19) (9, 15) (9, 29) (14, 5) (14, 26) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 10) (16, 15) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 17) (19, 21) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 14) (19, 28) (28, 13) (28, 2) (28, 16) (28, 19) (28, 22) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 2) (17, 16) (17, 24) (17, 4) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 17) (1, 25) (1, 18) (22, 14) (22, 28) (22, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 22) (4, 3) (4, 17) (11, 25) (11, 12) (23, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 2, 15, 29>
- <0, 2, 28, 13>
- <0, 2, 7, 8>
- <1, 25, 11, 12>
- <1, 25, 21, 26>
- <4, 3, 10, 12>
- <4, 17, 24, 12>
- <5, 6, 16, 15>
- <5, 16, 17, 24>
- <5, 16, 28, 2>
- <5, 18, 19, 21>
- <5, 18, 19, 29>
- <5, 18, 1, 25>
- <5, 14, 26, 21>
- <5, 14, 22, 28>
- <5, 14, 19, 29>
- <6, 5, 14, 22>
- <7, 8, 13, 28>
- <9, 15, 16, 5>
- <9, 15, 29, 19>
- <11, 25, 1, 18>
- <11, 25, 21, 26>
- <12, 27, 23, 13>
- <14, 5, 18, 19>
- <14, 5, 16, 17>
- <14, 5, 15, 29>
- <14, 19, 28, 22>
- <16, 5, 18, 1>
- <16, 15, 29, 9>
- <16, 15, 27, 12>
- <17, 16, 5, 18>
- <17, 16, 28, 22>
- <19, 14, 22, 15>
- <19, 28, 13, 12>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (25, 11), 12>
- <1, (25, 21), 26>
- <4, (17, 24), 12>
- <5, (16, 28), 2>
- <5, (18, 19), 21>
- <5, (18, 19), 29>
- <5, (14, 22), 28>
- <9, (15, 29), 19>
- <11, (25, 1), 18>
- <14, (5, 19), 29>
- <16, (5, 18), 1>
- <19, (14, 22), 15>
- <19, (28, 13), 12>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [13].
