Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 15) (13, 18) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 14) (7, 6) (7, 17) (12, 5) (12, 19) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 17) (14, 18) (14, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 15) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 19) (19, 1) (19, 12) (19, 5) (16, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 14) (17, 3) (17, 7) (17, 0) (15, 13) (15, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-7-17-3-1
- Cycle 3: 1-19-5-12-3-1
- Cycle 4: 3-13-2-9-10-3
- Cycle 5: 3-13-8-10-11-3
- Cycle 6: 3-13-18-14-9-2-13
- Cycle 7: 8-13-18-14-9-10-8
- Cycle 8: 13-15-4-6-7-17-13
- Cycle 9: 13-15-4-6-1-19-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the listed cycles, the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (4, 6), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
