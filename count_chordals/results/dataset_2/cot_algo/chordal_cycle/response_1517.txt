Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 17) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (2, 18) (2, 0) (2, 15) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 8) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 8) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 13) (10, 15) (10, 8) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 0) (15, 10) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 17) (8, 10) (19, 17) (19, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 6) (14, 5) (14, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 14) (6, 18) (6, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:  
- Cycle 1: (5, 12, 9, 11)
- Cycle 2: (5, 12, 1, 0)
- Cycle 3: (5, 12, 1, 0, 2)
- Cycle 4: (5, 12, 1, 0, 16, 13)
- Cycle 5: (5, 18, 6, 16)
- Cycle 6: (5, 14, 13, 16, 6)
- Cycle 7: (9, 11, 3, 4)
- Cycle 8: (9, 12, 1, 0)
- Cycle 9: (4, 17, 19, 3)
- Cycle 10: (4, 3, 11, 9)
- Cycle 11: (7, 5, 12, 1)
- Cycle 12: (7, 8, 17, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3: (5, 12, 1, 0, 2) has chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 8: (9, 12, 1, 0) has chord (9, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <5, 12, 9, 11>
- <5, 12, 1, 0, 16>
- <5, 14, 13, 16>
- <4, 17, 19, 3>
- <4, 3, 11, 9>
- <7, 5, 12, 1>
- <7, 8, 17, 19>
- <9, 12, 1, 0>
- <5, 18, 6, 16>
- <9, 11, 3, 4>
