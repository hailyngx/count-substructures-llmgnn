Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 17) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 24) (18, 27) (18, 15) (18, 12) (0, 8) (14, 26) (14, 19) (14, 20) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 22) (11, 5) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 13) (28, 23) (20, 14) (20, 29) (20, 27) (20, 10) (29, 20) (29, 9) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 22) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 10) (10, 20) (10, 9) (10, 22) (21, 15) (21, 17) (22, 11) (22, 28) (22, 8) (22, 10) (5, 2) (5, 11) (26, 14) (26, 25) (26, 17) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 13) (12, 23) (16, 17) (16, 25) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 21) (15, 16) (15, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 15) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 21) (17, 26) (17, 16) (24, 2) (24, 8) (24, 6) (6, 7) (6, 24) (6, 27) (6, 13) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 6) (13, 7) (13, 28) (13, 12) (13, 6) (25, 26) (25, 16) (23, 28) (23, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 1, 12, 18, 27, 20, 29, 9, 8)
- Cycle 2: (11, 5, 2, 24, 8, 22, 10, 20, 29)
- Cycle 3: (14, 19, 11, 22, 28, 13, 6, 27, 18)
- Cycle 4: (15, 18, 12, 13, 6, 27, 20, 29, 9)
- Cycle 5: (16, 17, 26, 14, 19, 15, 21, 17)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (4, 2), 18, 27, 20, 29, 9, 8>
- Cycle 2: <11, 5, (2, 24), 8, 22, 10, 20, 29>
- Cycle 3: <14, 19, 11, (22, 28), 13, 6, 27, 18>
- Cycle 4: <15, (18, 12), 13, 6, 27, 20, 29, 9>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <16, 17, 26, 14, 19, 15, 21, 17>
