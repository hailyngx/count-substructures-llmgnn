Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 8) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (6, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 13) (0, 10) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (0, 2, 1, 13, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 13, 3, 7, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 13, 5, 8, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 2, 14, 7, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 4, 9, 3, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 10, 2, 14, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 10, 8, 5, 0)
- Cycle 8: (1, 10, 14, 2, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 11, 12, 6, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 13, 5, 11, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 14, 2, 0, 1)
- Cycle 12: (2, 10, 14, 7, 2)
- Cycle 13: (3, 7, 14, 2, 3)
- Cycle 14: (3, 9, 10, 2, 3)
- Cycle 15: (3, 9, 4, 0, 3)
- Cycle 16: (3, 12, 11, 5, 3)
- Cycle 17: (5, 8, 10, 2, 5)
- Cycle 18: (5, 11, 1, 13, 5)
- Cycle 19: (5, 13, 0, 10, 5)
- Cycle 20: (7, 14, 2, 10, 7)
- Cycle 21: (7, 0, 4, 9, 7)
- Cycle 22: (8, 10, 2, 14, 8)
- Cycle 23: (8, 12, 11, 5, 8)
- Cycle 24: (9, 10, 2, 14, 9)
- Cycle 25: (10, 1, 13, 0, 10)
- Cycle 26: (11, 12, 6, 1, 11)
- Cycle 27: (12, 11, 3, 9, 12)
- Cycle 28: (13, 1, 2, 10, 13)
- Cycle 29: (14, 3, 9, 4, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (11, 5), 13, 0)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, (9, 10), 2, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (11, 1), 13, 0)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, (0, 9), 4, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <8, (12, 5), 11, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <12, (11, 9), 3, 12)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <13, (1, 2), 10, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <14, (4, 9), 3, 14)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 29 cycles in total and 8 of them are chordal 4-cycles, so the number of chordless cycles is 29 - 8 = 21. 

Therefore, the final count is [21].
