Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <5, 9, 7, 2, 1>
- <5, 1, 7, 2, 9>
- <9, 7, 1, 5, 4>
- <9, 7, 2, 1, 5>
- <4, 5, 1, 7, 0>
- <4, 5, 9, 7, 0>
- <7, 9, 8, 2, 1>
- <7, 9, 3, 0, 4>
- <1, 5, 4, 3, 0>
- <1, 5, 9, 7, 2>
- <3, 9, 8, 2, 7>
- <8, 9, 3, 0, 4>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <5, 9, 7, 2, 1> has a chord (9, 1)
- <5, 1, 7, 2, 9> has a chord (1, 7)
- <9, 7, 1, 5, 4> has a chord (7, 5)
- <9, 7, 2, 1, 5> has a chord (7, 1)
- <4, 5, 1, 7, 0> has no chord
- <4, 5, 9, 7, 0> has a chord (5, 7)
- <7, 9, 8, 2, 1> has a chord (9, 2)
- <7, 9, 3, 0, 4> has a chord (9, 4)
- <1, 5, 4, 3, 0> has no chord
- <1, 5, 9, 7, 2> has a chord (5, 7)
- <3, 9, 8, 2, 7> has a chord (9, 2)
- <8, 9, 3, 0, 4> has a chord (9, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<5, 9, 7, 2, 1>
<5, 1, 7, 2, 9>
<9, 7, 1, 5, 4>
<9, 7, 2, 1, 5>
<4, 5, 9, 7, 0>
<7, 9, 8, 2, 1>
<7, 9, 3, 0, 4>
