Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 10) (12, 5) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 10) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 13) (9, 11) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1-6-8-2-10-1
- Cycle 2: 1-3-0-4-5-1
- Cycle 3: 3-7-1-6-13-3
- Cycle 4: 3-5-8-7-1-3
- Cycle 5: 8-7-5-4-10-8
- Cycle 6: 11-0-3-5-12-11
- Cycle 7: 14-4-0-11-2-14
- Cycle 8: 9-11-2-8-6-9
- Cycle 9: 13-6-1-10-4-13
- Cycle 10: 2-8-5-4-14-2
- Cycle 11: 5-4-0-9-13-5
- Cycle 12: 1-7-8-5-4-1
- Cycle 13: 3-9-0-4-5-3
- Cycle 14: 6-8-11-0-4-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

From the listed cycles, the following cycles have exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-8-2-10-1 (Chord: (6, 2))
- Cycle 2: 1-3-0-4-5-1 (Chord: (0, 4))
- Cycle 3: 3-7-1-6-13-3 (Chord: (7, 13))
- Cycle 4: 3-5-8-7-1-3 (Chord: (5, 7))
- Cycle 5: 8-7-5-4-10-8 (Chord: (7, 4))
- Cycle 6: 11-0-3-5-12-11 (Chord: (0, 5))
- Cycle 8: 9-11-2-8-6-9 (Chord: (11, 2))
- Cycle 12: 1-7-8-5-4-1 (Chord: (7, 5))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [7]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
- <1, (6, 2), 10)>
- <1, (0, 4), 5)>
- <3, (7, 13), 6)>
- <3, (5, 7), 1)>
- <8, (7, 4), 10)>
- <11, (0, 5), 3)>
- <1, (7, 5), 4)>
