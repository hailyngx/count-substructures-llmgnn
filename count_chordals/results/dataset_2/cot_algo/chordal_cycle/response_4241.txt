Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 16) (14, 12) (14, 19) (17, 9) (17, 2) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 18) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 13) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 5) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 5) (10, 0) (10, 18) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 7) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 16) (8, 15) (8, 12) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 5) (18, 3) (18, 10) (18, 16) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 15) (5, 16) (4, 6) (4, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle <0, 3, 5, 1>
- Cycle <0, 3, 11, 19>
- Cycle <0, 3, 18, 16>
- Cycle <0, 12, 14, 19>
- Cycle <0, 12, 13, 11>
- Cycle <0, 13, 11, 3>
- Cycle <0, 13, 16, 18>
- Cycle <1, 5, 3, 0>
- Cycle <1, 5, 16, 13>
- Cycle <1, 5, 15, 8>
- Cycle <1, 2, 9, 17>
- Cycle <2, 9, 17, 4>
- Cycle <3, 5, 16, 18>
- Cycle <3, 11, 19, 14>
- Cycle <3, 18, 16, 9>
- Cycle <4, 6, 9, 17>
- Cycle <8, 15, 5, 3>
- Cycle <8, 15, 1, 2>
- Cycle <9, 17, 2, 1>
- Cycle <10, 0, 3, 5>
- Cycle <10, 0, 13, 16>
- Cycle <11, 19, 14, 12>
- Cycle <11, 19, 7, 14>
- Cycle <12, 14, 19, 7>
- Cycle <12, 13, 11, 19>
- Cycle <13, 16, 18, 10>
- Cycle <15, 8, 12, 0>
- Cycle <16, 9, 17, 2>
- Cycle <16, 13, 0, 3>
- Cycle <17, 9, 16, 13>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 3, 5, 1> has a chord (3, 1)
- Cycle <1, 2, 9, 17> has a chord (2, 9)
- Cycle <4, 6, 9, 17> has a chord (6, 17)
- Cycle <9, 17, 2, 1> has a chord (17, 2)
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [4] chordal 4-cycles found.
