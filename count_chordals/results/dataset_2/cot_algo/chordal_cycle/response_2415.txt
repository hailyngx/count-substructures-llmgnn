Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (10, 11) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (13, 10) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: 5 - 1 - 4 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 2: 9 - 1 - 4 - 0 - 9
- Cycle 3: 3 - 9 - 0 - 11 - 3
- Cycle 4: 10 - 11 - 3 - 7 - 10
- Cycle 5: 10 - 11 - 2 - 12 - 10
- Cycle 6: 5 - 12 - 2 - 13 - 5
- Cycle 7: 14 - 9 - 0 - 11 - 14
- Cycle 8: 14 - 7 - 3 - 11 - 14
- Cycle 9: 10 - 13 - 6 - 7 - 10
- Cycle 10: 14 - 13 - 2 - 12 - 14

Step 2:
Checking for the cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3: 3 - 9 - 0 - 11 - 3 with chord (9, 11)
- Cycle 6: 5 - 12 - 2 - 13 - 5 with chord (12, 13)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5, 1), 4, 8)>
- <2, (9, 11), 3, 0)>
- <3, (12, 13), 5, 2)>
- <4, (9, 11), 0, 3)>
- <5, (12, 13), 5, 2)>
- <6, (9, 11), 0, 3)>
- <7, (12, 13), 5, 2)>
- <8, (9, 11), 0, 3)>
