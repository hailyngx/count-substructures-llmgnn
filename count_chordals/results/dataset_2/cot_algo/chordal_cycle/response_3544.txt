Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 11, 13)
- Cycle 2: (6, 12, 7, 2)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 7, 2)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 13, 11)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 10, 5)
- Cycle 6: (3, 7, 12, 6)
- Cycle 7: (3, 13, 11, 10)
- Cycle 8: (4, 10, 12, 7)
- Cycle 9: (4, 5, 7, 12)
- Cycle 10: (5, 10, 11, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (9, 11). <1, (9, 11), 13>
- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (12, 7). <2, (12, 7), 6>
- Cycle 3 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (1, 2). <3, (1, 2), 7>
- Cycle 4 is not a chordal 4-cycle as it has no chords.
- Cycle 5 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (4, 10). <5, (4, 10), 1>
- Cycle 6 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (3, 13). <6, (3, 13), 7>
- Cycle 7 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (11, 10). <7, (11, 10), 3>
- Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (4, 7). <8, (4, 7), 10>
- Cycle 9 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (5, 7). <9, (5, 7), 12>
- Cycle 10 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (10, 11). <10, (10, 11), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]
