Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
<0, 6, 8, 2, 0>
<0, 4, 7, 3, 0>
<1, 3, 9, 2, 1>
<1, 5, 6, 4, 1>
<2, 8, 9, 3, 2>
<3, 0, 4, 7, 3>
<3, 1, 2, 8, 3>
<4, 6, 8, 7, 4>
<5, 1, 3, 9, 5>
<6, 4, 3, 0, 6>
<7, 4, 6, 8, 7>
<8, 2, 1, 5, 8>
<9, 1, 5, 6, 9>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
<0, 6, 8, 2, 0> has 2 chords: (6, 8) and (2, 0)
<0, 4, 7, 3, 0> has 2 chords: (4, 7) and (3, 0)
<1, 3, 9, 2, 1> has 2 chords: (3, 9) and (2, 1)
<1, 5, 6, 4, 1> has 2 chords: (5, 6) and (4, 1)
<2, 8, 9, 3, 2> has 2 chords: (8, 9) and (3, 2)
<3, 0, 4, 7, 3> has 2 chords: (0, 4) and (7, 3)
<3, 1, 2, 8, 3> has 2 chords: (1, 2) and (8, 3)
<4, 6, 8, 7, 4> has 2 chords: (6, 8) and (7, 4)
<5, 1, 3, 9, 5> has 2 chords: (1, 3) and (9, 5)
<6, 4, 3, 0, 6> has 2 chords: (4, 3) and (0, 6)
<7, 4, 6, 8, 7> has 2 chords: (4, 6) and (8, 7)
<8, 2, 1, 5, 8> has 2 chords: (2, 1) and (5, 8)
<9, 1, 5, 6, 9> has 2 chords: (1, 5) and (6, 9)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [13]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 6, 8, 2, 0>
<0, 4, 7, 3, 0>
<1, 3, 9, 2, 1>
<1, 5, 6, 4, 1>
<2, 8, 9, 3, 2>
<3, 0, 4, 7, 3>
<3, 1, 2, 8, 3>
<4, 6, 8, 7, 4>
<5, 1, 3, 9, 5>
<6, 4, 3, 0, 6>
<7, 4, 6, 8, 7>
<8, 2, 1, 5, 8>
<9, 1, 5, 6, 9>
