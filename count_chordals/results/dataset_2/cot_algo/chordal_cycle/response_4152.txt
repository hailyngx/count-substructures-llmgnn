Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 2) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 5) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 17) (1, 10) (1, 15) (1, 16) (15, 1) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 12) (5, 10) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 9) (7, 17) (7, 11) (7, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 18) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 16) (3, 12) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 14) (14, 15) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 9) (12, 15) (12, 3) (18, 10) (18, 11) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (1, 10, 4, 11)
- Cycle 2: (3, 17, 7, 11)
- Cycle 3: (5, 10, 1, 15)
- Cycle 4: (5, 3, 17, 7)
- Cycle 5: (6, 0, 8, 2)
- Cycle 6: (6, 14, 7, 11)
- Cycle 7: (9, 19, 5, 10)
- Cycle 8: (9, 14, 7, 17)
- Cycle 9: (9, 16, 1, 10)
- Cycle 10: (12, 15, 1, 10)
- Cycle 11: (12, 3, 17, 7)

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: (1, 10, 4, 11) with chord (10, 4)
- Cycle 9: (9, 16, 1, 10) with chord (1, 10)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [9].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<1, 10, 4, 11> 
<9, 16, 1, 10>
