Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 6) (1, 19) (17, 3) (17, 2) (17, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 15) (10, 3) (10, 19) (10, 2) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 18) (19, 1) (19, 10) (19, 4) (0, 8) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 9) (16, 0) (16, 4) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 12) (4, 14) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 4) (12, 13) (3, 17) (3, 10) (3, 18) (11, 5) (11, 13) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 15) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 14) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 18) (18, 15) (18, 3) (18, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles with length 4:
- (5, 6, 1, 19, 5)
- (17, 2, 10, 15, 17)
- (8, 0, 16, 9, 8)
- (9, 13, 11, 5, 9)
- (10, 15, 7, 6, 10)
- (19, 4, 12, 8, 19)
- (0, 12, 13, 11, 0)
- (16, 4, 14, 18, 16)
- (3, 18, 14, 2, 3)
- (17, 3, 10, 2, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The cycle (5, 6, 1, 19, 5) has a chord: (6, 19).
The cycle (17, 2, 10, 15, 17) has a chord: (2, 15).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 8 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<5, 6, 19, 1>
