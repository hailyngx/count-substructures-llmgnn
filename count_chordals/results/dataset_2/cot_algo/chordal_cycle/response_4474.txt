Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 18) (7, 9) (7, 0) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 8) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (0, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (15, 9) (15, 18) (15, 6) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 13) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 16) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (12, 18) (12, 6) (12, 16) (12, 19) (16, 10) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 8) (3, 13) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 14) (8, 18) (8, 16) (19, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

There are several cycles in the graph with length 4 or more, but not all of them have all edges present. We will list the cycles where all edges exist:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 15, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 17, 13, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 18, 15, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 17, 18, 15, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 15, 18, 4, 9)
- Cycle 6: (4, 18, 17, 13, 4)
- Cycle 7: (18, 17, 13, 2, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: <1, (6, 15), 4>
- Cycle 2: <2, (13, 17), 5>
- Cycle 3: <3, (4, 18), 16>
- Cycle 4: <6, (15, 4), 9>
- Cycle 5: <7, (9, 18), 5>
- Cycle 6: <8, (17, 4), 15>
- Cycle 7: <10, (18, 13), 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [7].
