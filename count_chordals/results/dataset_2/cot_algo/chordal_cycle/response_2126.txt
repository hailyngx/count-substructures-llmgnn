Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 19) (10, 17) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 10) (17, 13) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 3) (7, 16) (7, 12) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 9) (5, 10) (5, 3) (19, 16) (19, 18) (19, 15) (13, 17) (13, 0) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (6, 18) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (15, 19) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 14) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Some cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (16, 11, 17, 13)
- Cycle 2: (16, 11, 17, 10)
- Cycle 3: (16, 19, 18, 6)
- Cycle 4: (16, 19, 15, 5)
- Cycle 5: (11, 17, 13, 0)
- Cycle 6: (11, 17, 10, 5)
- Cycle 7: (17, 13, 0, 4)
- Cycle 8: (17, 13, 0, 6)
- Cycle 9: (17, 10, 5, 3)
- Cycle 10: (10, 5, 3, 8)
- Cycle 11: (5, 3, 8, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 8, 14, 9)
- Cycle 13: (4, 8, 3, 12)
- Cycle 14: (8, 3, 12, 9)
- Cycle 15: (8, 3, 5, 10)
- Cycle 16: (16, 19, 15, 19) - a cycle of length 4 with repeated edges

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (11, 13)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (11, 10)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (16, 6)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (16, 15)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (17, 0)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (17, 5)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (13, 4)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (13, 6)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (10, 3)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (4, 14)
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (4, 12)
- Cycle 13 has one chord: (8, 9)
- Cycle 14 has one chord: (8, 12)
- Cycle 15 has one chord: (5, 10)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [15].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (11, 13), 17)>
<2, (11, 10), 17)>
<3, (16, 6), 18)>
<4, (16, 15), 19)>
<5, (17, 0), 13)>
<6, (17, 5), 10)>
<7, (13, 4), 8)>
<8, (13, 6), 0)>
<9, (10, 3), 5)>
<10, (5, 8), 4)>
<11, (4, 14), 9)>
<12, (4, 12), 8)>
<13, (8, 9), 14)>
<14, (8, 12), 3)>
<15, (5, 10), 3)>
