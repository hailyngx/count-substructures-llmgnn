Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 8) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 13) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle <5, 9, 7, 4>
2. Cycle <5, 3, 1, 8>
3. Cycle <5, 3, 14, 10>
4. Cycle <5, 3, 13, 6>
5. Cycle <5, 11, 4, 6>
6. Cycle <5, 0, 6, 4>
7. Cycle <5, 0, 10, 8>
8. Cycle <9, 7, 4, 6>
9. Cycle <9, 14, 10, 8>
10. Cycle <6, 4, 11, 5>
11. Cycle <6, 0, 10, 14>
12. Cycle <3, 1, 8, 12>
13. Cycle <3, 14, 10, 11>
14. Cycle <3, 13, 6, 4>
15. Cycle <11, 4, 7, 9>
16. Cycle <11, 2, 3, 5>
17. Cycle <11, 2, 7, 4>
18. Cycle <4, 6, 0, 10>
19. Cycle <4, 7, 9, 5>
20. Cycle <7, 9, 14, 10>
21. Cycle <7, 2, 3, 5>
22. Cycle <8, 1, 3, 5>
23. Cycle <8, 12, 3, 14>
24. Cycle <10, 0, 6, 4>
25. Cycle <10, 8, 12, 3>
26. Cycle <12, 8, 1, 3>
27. Cycle <12, 14, 10, 0>
28. Cycle <0, 5, 3, 1>
29. Cycle <0, 6, 4, 11>
30. Cycle <0, 8, 12, 14>
31. Cycle <1, 3, 13, 6>
32. Cycle <2, 11, 4, 7>
33. Cycle <2, 7, 4, 6>
34. Cycle <13, 6, 4, 11>
35. Cycle <13, 14, 10, 0>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <5, 9, 7, 4> has chord (9, 7)
- <5, 3, 1, 8> has chord (3, 1)
- <5, 3, 14, 10> has chord (14, 3)
- <5, 3, 13, 6> has chord (13, 6)
- <5, 11, 4, 6> has chord (11, 4)
- <9, 14, 10, 8> has chord (14, 10)
- <3, 13, 6, 4> has chord (13, 6)
- <11, 4, 7, 9> has chord (4, 7)
- <11, 2, 3, 5> has chord (2, 3)
- <0, 5, 3, 1> has chord (5, 3)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
