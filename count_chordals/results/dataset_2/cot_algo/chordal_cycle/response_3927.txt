Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 9) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 1) (18, 3) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 0) (0, 11) (0, 19) (0, 3) (12, 11) (12, 16) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 17) (17, 12) (17, 5) (3, 18) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 14) (2, 11) (2, 14) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 17) (5, 1) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 2) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-3-14-2-11-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-3-18-14-2-0
        - Cycle 3: 5-7-10-15-4-5
        - Cycle 4: 5-17-12-13-5
        - Cycle 5: 6-9-4-7-6
        - Cycle 6: 9-16-12-13-9
        - Cycle 7: 12-13-7-4-12
        - Cycle 8: 12-16-9-6-12
        - Cycle 9: 13-12-17-5-13
        - Cycle 10: 14-3-0-19-1-14
        - Cycle 11: 15-10-7-4-15
        - Cycle 12: 18-14-2-11-18
        - Cycle 13: 18-3-0-19-18
        - Cycle 14: 19-1-5-17-19
        
Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 7: 12-13-7-4-12 has one chord (12, 4) 

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There is [1] chordal 4-cycle found.

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
        <12, (13, 4), 7>
