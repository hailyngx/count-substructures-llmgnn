Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (0, 4, 5, 3, 0)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 4, 5, 3, 6, 0)
        - Cycle 3: (0, 4, 5, 3, 2, 0)
        - Cycle 4: (0, 7, 1, 6, 0)
        - Cycle 5: (0, 7, 1, 6, 8, 0)
        - Cycle 6: (0, 7, 1, 6, 3, 0)
        - Cycle 7: (0, 7, 1, 9, 0)
        - Cycle 8: (0, 7, 1, 9, 2, 0)
        - Cycle 9: (0, 7, 8, 6, 0)
        - Cycle 10: (1, 7, 8, 6, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - <1, (9, 2), 0> has exactly one chord (9, 2).
        - <1, (6, 8), 7> has exactly one chord (6, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There are 8 chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [8].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found are <1, (9, 2), 0> and <1, (6, 8), 7>.
