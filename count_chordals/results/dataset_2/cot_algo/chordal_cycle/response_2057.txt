This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 8) (3, 16) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 14) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 13) (8, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 5) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 0) (7, 17) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 13) (17, 7) (17, 2) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 18) (19, 12) (18, 15) (18, 19) (9, 14) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 6) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 6) (12, 19) (12, 5) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:

        - Cycle 1: <1, 3, 4, 5>
        - Cycle 2: <1, 13, 14, 15>
        - Cycle 3: <2, 6, 10, 15>
        - Cycle 4: <2, 6, 14, 15>
        - Cycle 5: <2, 6, 14, 9>
        - Cycle 6: <2, 17, 7, 0>
        - Cycle 7: <3, 1, 13, 14>
        - Cycle 8: <3, 4, 5, 8>
        - Cycle 9: <4, 3, 16, 8>
        - Cycle 10: <5, 4, 3, 16>
        - Cycle 11: <5, 8, 13, 17>
        - Cycle 12: <6, 2, 17, 7>
        - Cycle 13: <6, 10, 15, 18>
        - Cycle 14: <8, 5, 4, 3>
        - Cycle 15: <8, 13, 17, 11>
        - Cycle 16: <10, 6, 2, 17>
        - Cycle 17: <10, 15, 14, 1>
        - Cycle 18: <13, 1, 3, 4>
        - Cycle 19: <14, 9, 6, 2>
        - Cycle 20: <15, 10, 6, 2>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

        - Cycle 1 has 2 non-adjacent chords: (3, 5).
        - Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (13, 15).
        - Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (6, 15).
        - Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (6, 14).
        - Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (6, 14).
        - Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (2, 7).
        - Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (1, 14).
        - Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (4, 5).
        - Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (3, 8).
        - Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (4, 5).
        - Cycle 11 has 1 chord: (8, 13).
        - Cycle 12 has 1 chord: (2, 7).
        - Cycle 13 has 1 chord: (10, 15).
        - Cycle 14 has 1 chord: (3, 8).
        - Cycle 15 has 1 chord: (8, 13).
        - Cycle 16 has 1 chord: (6, 17).
        - Cycle 17 has 1 chord: (10, 15).
        - Cycle 18 has 1 chord: (1, 4).
        - Cycle 19 has 1 chord: (6, 14).
        - Cycle 20 has 1 chord: (6, 10).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

        Number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:

        <1, 3, 4, 5>
