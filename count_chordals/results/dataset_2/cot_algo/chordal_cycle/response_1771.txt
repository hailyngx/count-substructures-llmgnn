Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 6) (16, 9) (16, 5) (0, 27) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 29) (27, 0) (27, 6) (27, 13) (27, 8) (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 10) (2, 25) (29, 0) (29, 2) (29, 19) (29, 15) (12, 17) (12, 3) (12, 26) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 7) (18, 17) (5, 16) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 11) (6, 27) (6, 5) (8, 27) (8, 23) (8, 4) (23, 8) (23, 3) (21, 28) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 4) (28, 21) (28, 22) (4, 0) (4, 8) (4, 21) (26, 2) (26, 12) (26, 10) (17, 12) (17, 18) (17, 19) (20, 21) (7, 0) (7, 18) (7, 25) (25, 2) (25, 7) (25, 1) (25, 22) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 26) (10, 9) (15, 29) (15, 19) (19, 29) (19, 17) (19, 15) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 23) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 3) (22, 21) (22, 28) (22, 25) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 10) (13, 27) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (0, 27, 6, 5, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 27, 6, 11, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 27, 8, 4, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 29, 2, 10, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 29, 2, 26, 0)
- Cycle 6: (2, 29, 15, 19, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 29, 19, 17, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 29, 15, 19, 29)
- Cycle 9: (2, 18, 14, 1, 2)
- Cycle 10: (2, 18, 17, 12, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 18, 7, 25, 2)
- Cycle 12: (27, 6, 5, 3, 27)
- Cycle 13: (27, 6, 11, 16, 27)
- Cycle 14: (27, 8, 4, 21, 27)
- Cycle 15: (27, 13, 3, 23, 27)
- Cycle 16: (27, 0, 10, 2, 29, 0)
- Cycle 17: (26, 2, 29, 19, 17, 12, 26)
- Cycle 18: (25, 2, 29, 19, 17, 12, 26, 10, 25)
- Cycle 19: (25, 7, 0)
- Cycle 20: (22, 21, 4, 8, 23, 3, 14, 1, 22)
- Cycle 21: (9, 1, 14, 3, 23, 8, 27, 6, 5, 16, 9)
- Cycle 22: (9, 10, 0, 7, 18, 17, 12, 3, 5, 6, 27, 8, 23, 3, 13, 9)
- Cycle 23: (7, 0, 4, 8, 27, 6, 11, 16, 5, 3, 13, 18, 17, 19, 29, 15, 7)
- Cycle 24: (1, 25, 7, 0, 27, 6, 11, 16, 9, 1)
- Cycle 25: (1, 14, 18, 17, 12, 3, 23, 8, 4, 21, 20, 22, 25, 9, 10, 26, 2, 15, 19, 27, 13, 1)
- Cycle 26: (1, 9, 16, 11, 6, 27, 13, 3, 23, 8, 4, 21, 20, 22, 25, 7, 0, 10, 26, 12, 17, 19, 15, 29, 2, 14, 1)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<25, (4, 21), 27, 6, 5> has one chord (4, 21).
<6, (11, 16), 27, 0, 10> has one chord (11, 16).
<26, (2, 12), 17, 18, 14> has one chord (2, 12).
<22, (21, 25), 4, 8, 23> has one chord (21, 25).
<1, (9, 10), 26, 12, 17> has one chord (9, 10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 26 chordal 4-cycles found in total, so the final count is [26].
