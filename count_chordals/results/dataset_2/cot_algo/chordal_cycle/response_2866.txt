Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 8, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <5, 9, 8, 4> has one chord: (9, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [0]
