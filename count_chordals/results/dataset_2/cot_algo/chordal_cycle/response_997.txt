Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 2) (13, 4) (13, 9) (0, 3) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (11, 2) (11, 4) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 2, 10, 7)
- Cycle 2: (1, 12, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (3, 8, 14, 7)
- Cycle 4: (3, 12, 6, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 12, 1)
- Cycle 6: (5, 10, 14, 7)
- Cycle 7: (6, 2, 10, 1)
- Cycle 8: (9, 0, 3, 8)
- Cycle 9: (9, 2, 6, 12)
- Cycle 10: (9, 13, 4, 14)
- Cycle 11: (10, 7, 5, 6)
- Cycle 12: (10, 9, 2, 6)
- Cycle 13: (10, 14, 7, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 7): <1, (1, 7), 2, 10, 7)>
- Cycle 2 has a chord (12, 5): <2, 5, 12, (12, 5), 6)>
- Cycle 3 has a chord (3, 14): <3, (3, 14), 8, 7, 10)>
- Cycle 4 has a chord (3, 5): <3, 5, (3, 5), 12, 6)>
- Cycle 5 has a chord (1, 12): <1, 2, 5, 6, (1, 12)>
- Cycle 6 has a chord (5, 10): <5, 6, 7, 10, (5, 10)>
- Cycle 7 has a chord (1, 10): <1, 2, (1, 10), 6, 7)>
- Cycle 8 has a chord (3, 8): <3, 8, (3, 8), 9, 0)>
- Cycle 9 has a chord (9, 12): <9, 2, (9, 12), 6, 12)>
- Cycle 10 has a chord (9, 4): <9, 10, (9, 4), 13, 14)>
- Cycle 11 has a chord (5, 6): <5, 6, (5, 6), 10, 7)>
- Cycle 12 has a chord (2, 9): <2, 6, 10, 9, (2, 9)>
- Cycle 13 has a chord (7, 10): <7, (7, 10), 14, 5, 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are [13] chordal 4-cycles found.
