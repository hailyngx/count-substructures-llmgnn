Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-2-7-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-4-9-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-8-3-1
- Cycle 4: 3-5-0-9-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (6, 7), 2>
- <1, (4, 9), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- 2 chordless cycles found

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
