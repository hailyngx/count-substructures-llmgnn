Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 10) (15, 19) (27, 25) (27, 11) (27, 19) (27, 13) (14, 0) (14, 25) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 9) (8, 2) (8, 28) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 23) (13, 18) (22, 2) (22, 20) (22, 1) (23, 13) (23, 21) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (11, 27) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 21) (28, 8) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 16) (29, 28) (29, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 12) (12, 29) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 18) (20, 15) (20, 22) (20, 26) (20, 2) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 20) (2, 5) (2, 6) (26, 28) (26, 20) (26, 21) (26, 16) (16, 28) (16, 26) (16, 19) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 26) (21, 25) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 19) (25, 27) (25, 14) (25, 21) (5, 2) (3, 18) (1, 22) (19, 15) (19, 27) (19, 16) (19, 4) (9, 17) (9, 0) (18, 13) (18, 12) (18, 3) 

Response:
First, I will list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 20-15-10-0-14-25-27-19
- Cycle 2: 27-25-14-0-10-15-20-22
- Cycle 3: 27-25-21-26-20-2-22-1
- Cycle 4: 13-17-6-10-15-19-27-13
- Cycle 5: 13-17-6-2-8-28-26-21
- Cycle 6: 13-17-6-2-22-20-26-21
- Cycle 7: 13-18-3-12-29-28-26-21
- Cycle 8: 13-18-3-12-7-11-27-19
- Cycle 9: 12-7-0-10-15-19-27-13
- Cycle 10: 12-7-0-10-6-2-22-1
- Cycle 11: 12-7-0-10-6-4-19-16
- Cycle 12: 12-29-28-8-2-6-4-19

Next, I will check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (0, 14), 20>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (20, 22), 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (26, 28), 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (6, 10), 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (6, 2), 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (6, 2), 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (12, 28), 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (7, 11), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (0, 10), 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, (7, 0), 12>

Finally, I will count the number of chordless cycles found, which are the cycles without exactly one chord:

The number of chordless cycles = 12 - 10 = 2

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
