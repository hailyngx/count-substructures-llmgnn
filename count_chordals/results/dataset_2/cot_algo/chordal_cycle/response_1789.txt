Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 15) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 21) (9, 3) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 25) (13, 23) (13, 14) (0, 20) (0, 16) (0, 29) (0, 26) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 28) (15, 6) (15, 20) (15, 28) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 27) (12, 7) (12, 29) (11, 2) (28, 8) (28, 20) (28, 15) (28, 18) (25, 8) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 19) (25, 22) (1, 6) (1, 14) (3, 9) (3, 21) (3, 29) (21, 9) (21, 3) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 10) (2, 6) (2, 11) (23, 13) (23, 5) (23, 18) (26, 0) (26, 25) (26, 29) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 1) (5, 23) (5, 4) (19, 25) (19, 4) (19, 17) (17, 19) (17, 22) (18, 28) (18, 23) (24, 29) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 19) (29, 0) (29, 12) (29, 3) (29, 26) (29, 24) (27, 20) (27, 7) (27, 10) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 27) (10, 22) (22, 25) (22, 16) (22, 17) (22, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (6, 1, 14, 7, 25, 8, 28, 15, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 15, 20, 28, 18, 23, 13, 14, 1, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 2, 11, 23, 13, 14, 1, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 9, 4, 5, 23, 13, 14, 7, 25, 8, 28, 15, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 9, 21, 3, 29, 24, 4, 5, 23, 18, 28, 20, 15, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 15, 20, 28, 8, 25, 19, 4, 9, 21, 3, 29, 26, 0, 20, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 2, 11, 23, 18, 28, 20, 27, 10, 16, 0, 26, 29, 12, 7, 14, 13, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 9, 21, 3, 29, 26, 0, 16, 10, 27, 7, 14, 13, 23, 18, 28, 15, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <6, (6, 15), 8>
- <6, (6, 2), 11>
- <6, (6, 9), 4>
- <6, (6, 9), 21>
- <6, (6, 15), 20>
- <6, (6, 15), 28>
- <6, (6, 15), 28>
- <6, (6, 9), 21>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
