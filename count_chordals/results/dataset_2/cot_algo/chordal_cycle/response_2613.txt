Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

Cycles with a length of 4:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 1, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 3: (7, 6, 1, 4, 7)
- Cycle 4: (6, 7, 4, 1, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 7, 3, 0, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 7, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 1, 4, 3, 6)
- Cycle 8: (1, 4, 2, 5, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 4, 8, 9, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 6, 7, 5, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 6, 2, 8, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 6, 3, 0, 1)
- Cycle 13: (7, 5, 2, 4, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 5, 2, 6, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 5, 8, 9, 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 5, 8, 0, 7)
- Cycle 17: (7, 5, 2, 4, 7)
- Cycle 18: (5, 7, 4, 1, 5)
- Cycle 19: (5, 7, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 20: (2, 5, 7, 4, 2)
- Cycle 21: (2, 5, 7, 6, 2)
- Cycle 22: (2, 5, 8, 0, 2)
- Cycle 23: (2, 5, 8, 7, 2)
- Cycle 24: (0, 8, 4, 1, 0)
- Cycle 25: (0, 8, 2, 5, 0)
- Cycle 26: (0, 8, 5, 7, 0)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, (6, 9), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final result is [1].
