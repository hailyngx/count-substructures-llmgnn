Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 23) (14, 21) (17, 10) (17, 23) (17, 15) (20, 22) (20, 11) (25, 27) (25, 18) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 16) (10, 29) (5, 6) (5, 26) (5, 29) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 11) (28, 6) (28, 8) (28, 9) (1, 15) (1, 23) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 2) (21, 14) (21, 10) (21, 27) (21, 9) (0, 29) (0, 19) (16, 10) (16, 24) (16, 3) (16, 27) (26, 5) (26, 2) (26, 12) (24, 16) (24, 22) (24, 13) (24, 2) (27, 25) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 18) (27, 13) (8, 28) (8, 15) (8, 22) (8, 7) (3, 16) (7, 8) (7, 18) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 8) (18, 25) (18, 27) (18, 7) (23, 14) (23, 17) (23, 1) (23, 19) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 24) (4, 9) (9, 28) (9, 21) (9, 4) (9, 19) (19, 0) (19, 23) (19, 9) (19, 12) (13, 24) (13, 27) (11, 20) (11, 6) (29, 10) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 12) (12, 26) (12, 19) (12, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: (14, 23), (17, 23), (17, 15), (1, 15)
- Cycle 2: (17, 23), (17, 15), (15, 1), (1, 23)
- Cycle 3: (17, 15), (17, 23), (23, 1), (15, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 15), (15, 17), (17, 23), (1, 23)
- Cycle 5: (1, 15), (15, 17), (17, 23), (1, 23)
- Cycle 6: (21, 14), (14, 23), (23, 1), (21, 1)
- Cycle 7: (21, 14), (14, 23), (23, 1), (21, 1)
- Cycle 8: (21, 14), (14, 23), (23, 1), (21, 1)
- Cycle 9: (21, 14), (14, 23), (23, 1), (21, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- None of the cycles listed in Step 1 have exactly one chord.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
