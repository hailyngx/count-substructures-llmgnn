Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 19) (14, 15) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 5) (17, 8) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 1) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 1) (5, 17) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 16) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 12) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 11) (1, 13) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 12) (16, 18) (16, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 15) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 9) (9, 0) (9, 19) (13, 1) (13, 15) (13, 3) (13, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 17, 5, 18, 1)
- (1, 17, 8, 12, 1)
- (1, 17, 8, 11, 1)
- (1, 17, 5, 0, 1)
- (1, 17, 10, 6, 1)
- (1, 17, 10, 2, 1)
- (1, 17, 10, 6, 16)
- (1, 11, 4, 12, 1)
- (1, 11, 4, 8, 1)
- (1, 11, 4, 8, 17)
- (1, 13, 3, 7, 1)
- (1, 13, 3, 7, 6)
- (1, 13, 15, 12, 1)
- (1, 13, 15, 14, 1)
- (1, 18, 5, 0, 1)
- (1, 18, 16, 6, 1)
- (1, 18, 16, 6, 10)
- (1, 13, 19, 14, 1)
- (1, 13, 19, 11, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, 17, 5, 0, 1>
- <1, 17, 8, 12, 1>
- <1, 17, 10, 6, 1>
- <1, 11, 4, 8, 1>
- <1, 13, 3, 7, 1>
- <1, 13, 15, 12, 1>
- <1, 18, 16, 6, 1>
- <1, 13, 19, 14, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [8].
