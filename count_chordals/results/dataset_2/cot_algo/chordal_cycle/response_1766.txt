Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 1, 7, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 4, 8, 5, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 5, 2, 1, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 3, 4, 5, 6)
- Cycle 5: (9, 3, 4, 8, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 7, 1, 2, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 5, 2, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 3, 5, 8, 4)
- Cycle 9: (8, 5, 3, 4, 8)
- Cycle 10: (5, 3, 4, 6, 5)
- Cycle 11: (3, 6, 5, 4, 3)
- Cycle 12: (7, 1, 2, 5, 7)
- Cycle 13: (2, 5, 3, 4, 2)
- Cycle 14: (1, 2, 5, 4, 1)
- Cycle 15: (0, 1, 2, 4, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, (9, 1), 7, (6, 3)> has one chord (9, 1)
- <6, (4, 8), 5, (6, 3)> has one chord (4, 8)
- <6, (5, 2), 1, (6, 4)> has one chord (5, 2)
- <9, (3, 4), 8, (9, 7)> has one chord (3, 4)
- <4, (8, 5), 2, (4, 3)> has one chord (8, 5)
- <8, (5, 3), 4, (8, 4)> has one chord (5, 3)
- <5, (3, 4), 6, (5, 2)> has one chord (3, 4)
- <3, (6, 5), 4, (3, 5)> has one chord (6, 5)
- <7, (1, 2), 5, (7, 6)> has one chord (1, 2)
- <2, (5, 3), 4, (2, 1)> has one chord (5, 3)
- <1, (2, 5), 4, (1, 0)> has one chord (2, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 11 chordal 4-cycles in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
