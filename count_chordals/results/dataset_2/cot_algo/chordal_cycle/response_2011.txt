Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 16) (22, 18) (22, 6) (22, 0) (22, 12) (22, 3) (4, 27) (4, 3) (8, 15) (8, 12) (1, 26) (1, 2) (1, 0) (26, 18) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 13) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 27) (21, 24) (28, 21) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 5) (19, 26) (19, 10) (13, 26) (13, 24) (13, 15) (13, 7) (6, 22) (6, 21) (16, 18) (16, 28) (16, 15) (16, 9) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 16) (9, 16) (9, 29) (9, 11) (29, 9) (29, 14) (11, 9) (11, 23) (11, 7) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 14) (27, 4) (27, 21) (27, 5) (0, 22) (0, 1) (0, 10) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 12) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (17, 28) (5, 28) (5, 23) (5, 27) (5, 7) (25, 2) (2, 1) (2, 25) (2, 24) (2, 14) (3, 22) (3, 4) (3, 14) (14, 29) (14, 23) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 24) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 10) (24, 21) (24, 13) (24, 2) (24, 14) 

Response:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [2].

The two unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <16, (18, 22), 0, 1>
2. <5, (7, 27), 23, 14>
