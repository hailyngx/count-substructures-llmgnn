Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 17) (27, 26) (27, 13) (27, 6) (14, 17) (14, 9) (17, 27) (17, 14) (17, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (22, 20) (22, 24) (22, 3) (22, 21) (10, 20) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 20) (0, 20) (0, 28) (20, 22) (20, 10) (20, 11) (20, 0) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 26) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 8) (28, 0) (28, 9) (28, 1) (1, 28) (1, 5) (25, 7) (25, 8) (25, 24) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 2) (23, 29) (8, 12) (8, 25) (8, 3) (19, 18) (19, 21) (4, 13) (4, 26) (4, 2) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 4) (16, 21) (16, 9) (21, 22) (21, 19) (21, 16) (21, 9) (24, 22) (24, 11) (24, 25) (3, 22) (3, 8) (3, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 23) (2, 23) (2, 4) (2, 26) (2, 6) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 4) (26, 2) (6, 27) (6, 18) (6, 3) (6, 2) (29, 12) (29, 23) (9, 14) (9, 28) (9, 16) (9, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (20, 22, 3, 6)
        - Cycle 2: (27, 26, 2, 4)
        - Cycle 3: (12, 7, 26, 2)
        - Cycle 4: (23, 11, 20, 0)
        - Cycle 5: (9, 14, 17, 13)
        - Cycle 6: (21, 16, 9, 28)
        - Cycle 7: (25, 24, 22, 3)
        - Cycle 8: (28, 0, 20, 11)
        - Cycle 9: (18, 19, 21, 16)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <20, (22, 3), 6>
        - <27, (26, 2), 4>
        - <12, (7, 26), 2>
        - <23, (11, 20), 0>
        - <9, (14, 17), 13>
        - <21, (16, 9), 28>
        - <25, (24, 22), 3>
        - <28, (0, 20), 11>
        - <18, (19, 21), 16>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        As all cycles found have exactly one chord, there are no chordless cycles.
        
Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
