Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 13) (7, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (12, 5) (12, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 12, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 8, 11, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 6, 2, 14, 5)
- Cycle 4: (4, 8, 0, 13, 1)
- Cycle 5: (7, 3, 1, 2, 10, 5)
- Cycle 6: (10, 2, 1, 13, 0, 11, 9)
- Cycle 7: (11, 8, 0, 10, 6, 9)

Step 2: 
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (3, 9), 5>
- <2, (6, 10), 13>
- <5, (4, 9), 12>
- <6, (2, 14), 9>
- <8, (0, 13), 4>

Step 3: 
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [5].
