Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 2) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 19) (0, 6) (14, 0) (14, 10) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (19, 0) (19, 5) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 15) (10, 8) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 9) (15, 18) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 6) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 13) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 9) (7, 18) (12, 16) (12, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 5) (3, 13) (17, 4) (2, 16) (2, 4) (4, 11) (4, 17) (4, 2) (18, 15) (18, 7) (18, 13) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 12) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle <0, 10, 15, 7, 16>
- Cycle <0, 10, 15, 18, 13>
- Cycle <0, 14, 10, 15, 18>
- Cycle <0, 14, 10, 15, 7>
- Cycle <0, 14, 10, 8, 6>
- Cycle <5, 19, 0, 14, 10>
- Cycle <5, 19, 0, 10, 15>
- Cycle <5, 19, 0, 6, 8>
- Cycle <5, 1, 11, 16, 7>
- Cycle <5, 1, 11, 9, 15>
- Cycle <5, 3, 13, 18, 15>
- Cycle <5, 3, 13, 9, 7>
- Cycle <9, 7, 15, 10, 14>
- Cycle <9, 7, 15, 18, 13>
- Cycle <9, 15, 10, 14, 0>
- Cycle <9, 15, 10, 8, 6>
- Cycle <9, 15, 18, 13, 3>
- Cycle <9, 15, 18, 7, 16>
- Cycle <10, 15, 18, 13, 3>
- Cycle <10, 15, 18, 7, 16>
- Cycle <10, 8, 6, 12, 16>
- Cycle <15, 18, 13, 3, 5>
- Cycle <15, 18, 7, 16, 11>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 10, 15, 7, 16>: (0, 15)
- <0, 14, 10, 15, 18>: (0, 15)
- <0, 14, 10, 15, 7>: (0, 15)
- <5, 19, 0, 14, 10>: (0, 14)
- <5, 19, 0, 6, 8>: (0, 6)
- <5, 1, 11, 16, 7>: (11, 16)
- <9, 7, 15, 10, 14>: (10, 15)
- <9, 15, 18, 13, 3>: (15, 13)
- <10, 8, 6, 12, 16>: (8, 12)

Step 3:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the final count is [8].
