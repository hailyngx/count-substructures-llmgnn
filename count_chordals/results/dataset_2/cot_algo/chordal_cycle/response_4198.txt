Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 1) (6, 7) (6, 14) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 1) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 2) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-10-5
- Cycle 2: 9-8-13-7-9
- Cycle 3: 4-10-3-8-4
- Cycle 4: 7-14-6-7
- Cycle 5: 11-13-1-8-11
- Cycle 6: 0-10-1-12-0
- Cycle 7: 2-14-3-0-2
- Cycle 8: 12-1-10-5-12

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (10, 5), 4, 9>
- <8, (13, 7), 9, 4>
- <10, (3, 8), 4, 11>
- <7, (14, 6), 7, 13>
- <11, (1, 8), 13, 4>
- <0, (12, 1), 10, 3>
- <14, (2, 3), 6, 7>
- <12, (10, 1), 5, 9>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
