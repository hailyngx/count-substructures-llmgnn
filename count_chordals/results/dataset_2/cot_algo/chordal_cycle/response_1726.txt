- Cycle 24: 0-8-11-14-0
- Cycle 25: 0-7-6-2-0
- Cycle 26: 0-7-6-10-0

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (3, 9), 8, 1> has one chord (3, 9)
- <1, (3, 4), 11, 1> has one chord (3, 4)
- <1, (3, 5), 12, 1> has one chord (3, 5)
- <1, (10, 14), 12, 1> has one chord (10, 14)
- <3, (4, 9), 12, 3> has one chord (4, 9)
- <3, (4, 11), 14, 3> has one chord (4, 11)
- <3, (5, 12), 14, 3> has one chord (5, 12)
- <10, (14, 12), 9, 10> has one chord (14, 12)
- <11, (14, 12), 9, 11> has one chord (14, 12)
- <2, (3, 4), 11, 2> has one chord (3, 4)
- <2, (3, 9), 12, 2> has one chord (3, 9)
- <2, (3, 5), 12, 2> has one chord (3, 5)
- <2, (6, 10), 14, 2> has one chord (6, 10)
- <8, (9, 12), 14, 8> has one chord (9, 12)
- <8, (9, 4), 11, 8> has one chord (9, 4)
- <8, (9, 12), 10, 8> has one chord (9, 12)
- <8, (9, 3), 4, 8> has one chord (9, 3)
- <0, (1, 3), 4, 0> has one chord (1, 3)
- <0, (1, 3), 9, 0> has one chord (1, 3)
- <0, (1, 5), 12, 0> has one chord (1, 5)
- <0, (1, 10), 14, 0> has one chord (1, 10)
- <0, (8, 9), 12, 0> has one chord (8, 9)
- <0, (8, 9), 4, 0> has one chord (8, 9)
- <0, (8, 11), 14, 0> has one chord (8, 11)
- <0, (7, 6), 2, 0> has one chord (7, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 24 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count is [24].
