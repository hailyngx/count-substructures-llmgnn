The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 12) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 15) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 20) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 20) (22, 1) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 9) (17, 10) (17, 28) (17, 5) (17, 27) (4, 8) (4, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (28, 17) (28, 29) (28, 27) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 13) (29, 0) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 13) (21, 16) (21, 24) (7, 0) (12, 3) (27, 17) (27, 28) (27, 14) (0, 11) (0, 29) (0, 7) (0, 9) (9, 23) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 24) (14, 27) (14, 26) (14, 2) (14, 13) (26, 23) (26, 14) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 5) (1, 25) (1, 22) (1, 4) (1, 6) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 29) (19, 13) (15, 25) (15, 23) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 14) (13, 29) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 19) (5, 17) (5, 16) (24, 23) (24, 21) (24, 9) (24, 20) (20, 11) (20, 22) (20, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <3, 25, 15, 23>
- <10, 11, 2, 14>
- <10, 11, 20, 22>
- <10, 17, 27, 28>
- <10, 19, 22, 1>
- <10, 19, 29, 13>
- <10, 17, 28, 27>
- <11, 0, 7, 29>
- <22, 1, 6, 16>
- <22, 20, 24, 21>
- <10, 19, 22, 23>
- <11, 2, 14, 13>
- <11, 20, 24, 21>
- <25, 1, 4, 8>
- <25, 15, 23, 26>
- <17, 10, 19, 22>
- <17, 28, 27, 14>
- <19, 10, 11, 2>
- <19, 22, 23, 26>
- <19, 29, 0, 11>
- <15, 25, 1, 6>
- <15, 23, 9, 0>
- <23, 22, 1, 6>
- <23, 15, 25, 3>
- <28, 17, 10, 11>
- <28, 27, 14, 2>
- <29, 19, 22, 20>
- <6, 1, 22, 19>
- <6, 16, 21, 24>
- <11, 20, 22, 23>
- <19, 10, 17, 28>
- <13, 14, 2, 11>
- <13, 29, 19, 10>
- <1, 25, 3, 8>
- <1, 6, 16, 5>
- <9, 23, 22, 19>
- <9, 0, 11, 20>
- <27, 17, 10, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, 25, 15, 23>: (3, 15) or (25, 23)
- <10, 11, 2, 14>: (11, 2)
- <10, 11, 20, 22>: (11, 20)
- <10, 17, 27, 28>: (17, 27)
- <10, 19, 29, 13>: (19, 13)
- <11, 0, 7, 29>: (11, 7)
- <22, 1, 6, 16>: (1, 6)
- <10, 19, 22, 23>: (19, 22)
- <17, 28, 27, 14>: (28, 27)
- <19, 10, 11, 2>: (10, 11)
- <15, 25, 1, 6>: (25, 1)
- <23, 15, 25, 3>: (15, 25)
- <11, 20, 22, 23>: (20, 22)
- <13, 14, 2, 11>: (14, 2)
- <1, 25, 3, 8>: (25, 3)
- <9, 23, 22, 19>: (23, 22)
- <27, 17, 10, 19>: (17, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- From the above, there are 17 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [17].
