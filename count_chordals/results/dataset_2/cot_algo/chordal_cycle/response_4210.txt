Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 19) (16, 14) (6, 9) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 15) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 18) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 14) (15, 17) (15, 1) (5, 7) (5, 18) (5, 14) (19, 16) (19, 3) (19, 12) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 19) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (3, 19) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 5) (18, 6) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 13) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 7, 8, 4, 13>
- Cycle <0, 7, 5, 14, 1>
- Cycle <0, 2, 9, 1, 14>
- Cycle <0, 2, 10, 8, 4>
- Cycle <0, 13, 4, 16, 14>
- Cycle <1, 9, 11, 17, 15>
- Cycle <1, 9, 6, 12, 17>
- Cycle <1, 14, 16, 4, 8>
- Cycle <2, 9, 1, 14, 5>
- Cycle <2, 10, 8, 18, 5>
- Cycle <2, 0, 7, 5, 14>
- Cycle <3, 19, 12, 6, 9>
- Cycle <4, 8, 10, 2, 0>
- Cycle <4, 16, 11, 17, 15>
- Cycle <4, 16, 14, 1, 9>
- Cycle <5, 7, 8, 18, 13>
- Cycle <5, 14, 16, 4, 13>
- Cycle <5, 18, 8, 4, 16>
- Cycle <6, 9, 1, 14, 16>
- Cycle <6, 12, 17, 15, 1>
- Cycle <6, 12, 19, 16, 14>
- Cycle <7, 8, 10, 2, 0>
- Cycle <7, 5, 14, 1, 9>
- Cycle <7, 0, 13, 4, 16>
- Cycle <8, 10, 2, 0, 13>
- Cycle <8, 4, 16, 14, 1>
- Cycle <8, 18, 5, 14, 1>
- Cycle <8, 18, 13, 0, 7>
- Cycle <9, 1, 14, 16, 4>
- Cycle <9, 6, 12, 17, 15>
- Cycle <9, 6, 9, 1, 14>
- Cycle <10, 2, 0, 7, 5>
- Cycle <11, 17, 15, 1, 9>
- Cycle <13, 18, 8, 4, 16>
- Cycle <15, 17, 11, 16, 14>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 2, 9, 1, 14> (Chord: (9, 1))
- <2, 10, 8, 18, 5> (Chord: (10, 18))
- <6, 9, 1, 14, 16> (Chord: (9, 16))
- <7, 8, 10, 2, 0> (Chord: (8, 2))
- <11, 17, 15, 1, 9> (Chord: (17, 15))
- <13, 18, 8, 4, 16> (Chord: (18, 4))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [33]
