Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-3-9-4
- Cycle 2: 4-5-1-2-4
- Cycle 3: 4-1-2-9-4
- Cycle 4: 4-6-0-2-4
- Cycle 5: 7-0-6-4-7
- Cycle 6: 7-5-1-2-7
- Cycle 7: 7-3-9-2-7
- Cycle 8: 9-4-1-5-9
- Cycle 9: 9-2-1-5-9
- Cycle 10: 1-5-2-9-1
- Cycle 11: 3-7-5-2-3
- Cycle 12: 5-2-0-8-5
- Cycle 13: 2-1-5-0-2
- Cycle 14: 2-9-8-0-2
- Cycle 15: 0-6-4-2-0

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed, only one cycle has exactly one chord, which is Cycle 4: 4-6-0-2-4 with the chord 6-2.

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, (6, 2), 4>.
