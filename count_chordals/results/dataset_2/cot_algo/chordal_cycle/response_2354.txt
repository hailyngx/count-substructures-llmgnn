Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 29) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 19) (9, 22) (9, 16) (9, 7) (7, 9) (7, 21) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 2) (20, 25) (20, 19) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 10) (25, 11) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 15) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 17) (23, 13) (4, 8) (4, 29) (4, 2) (12, 24) (0, 2) (2, 21) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (19, 9) (19, 20) (19, 28) (19, 14) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 28) (13, 23) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 27) (5, 13) (5, 16) (16, 9) (16, 21) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 17) (28, 19) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 3) (28, 18) (29, 6) (29, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 10) (15, 8) (18, 28) (27, 13) (27, 22) (27, 24) (27, 14) (10, 25) (10, 1) (3, 28) (3, 17) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 16) (17, 3) (22, 9) (22, 27) (24, 12) (24, 27) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 27) (11, 6) (11, 25) (11, 2) 

Response:
Let's count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 16, 5, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 1, 10, 25, 11, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 29, 4, 2, 21, 7, 6)
- Cycle 4: (9, 16, 5, 13, 27, 24, 12, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 22, 27, 24, 12, 24, 27, 22, 9)
- Cycle 6: (7, 1, 10, 25, 17, 3, 28, 16, 21, 7)
- Cycle 7: (21, 2, 4, 29, 6, 11, 25, 10, 1, 7)
- Cycle 8: (20, 25, 11, 2, 4, 29, 6, 1, 10, 20)
- and so on for other cycles

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Out of the listed cycles, we find that Cycle 3: (6, 29, 4, 2, 21, 7, 6) has exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <3, (4, 21), 7>
