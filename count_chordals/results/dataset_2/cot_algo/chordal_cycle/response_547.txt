Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 17) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 11) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 12) (18, 4) (18, 11) (18, 5) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 17) (8, 6) (8, 12) (5, 18) (5, 2) (5, 8) (19, 7) (19, 17) (19, 9) (13, 7) (13, 15) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 19) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 16) (16, 1) (16, 2) (16, 12) (16, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 15) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 9) (9, 19) (9, 15) (14, 10) (14, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-18-5-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-18-11-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-17-8-5-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-11-18-5-2-1
- Cycle 5: 1-3-11-18-4-1
- Cycle 6: 1-10-14-16-1
- Cycle 7: 1-10-14-16-12-11-1
- Cycle 8: 1-10-11-18-5-2-1
- Cycle 9: 1-11-18-5-8-17-1
- Cycle 10: 1-11-18-5-2-16-1
- Cycle 11: 1-16-2-6-15-1
- Cycle 12: 1-16-12-8-17-1
- Cycle 13: 2-5-8-17-1-16-2
- Cycle 14: 2-5-8-17-19-9-15-2
- Cycle 15: 2-6-7-13-15-2
- Cycle 16: 2-6-15-9-19-17-8-5-2
- Cycle 17: 2-6-15-13-7-6
- Cycle 18: 4-18-11-1-16-2-5-4
- Cycle 19: 4-18-11-12-16-1-4
- Cycle 20: 5-18-11-1-16-2-6-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 4, 5, 18, 2>
- <1, 4, 18, 11, 1>
- <1, 4, 17, 8, 5>
- <1, 3, 11, 18, 5>
- <1, 10, 14, 16, 1>
- <1, 10, 14, 16, 12, 11>
- <1, 10, 11, 18, 5>
- <1, 11, 18, 5, 2>
- <1, 16, 2, 6, 15>
- <2, 5, 8, 17, 1>
- <2, 6, 7, 13, 15>
- <4, 18, 11, 1, 16>
- <5, 18, 11, 1, 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [12]
