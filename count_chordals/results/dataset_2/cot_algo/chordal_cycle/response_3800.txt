Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 22) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 14) (17, 23) (17, 22) (17, 11) (7, 21) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 1) (21, 15) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 10) (21, 29) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 24) (8, 16) (8, 26) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 24) (26, 8) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 18) (0, 4) (0, 20) (0, 25) (0, 18) (20, 7) (20, 0) (20, 11) (5, 19) (6, 7) (6, 1) (24, 8) (24, 1) (24, 26) (19, 5) (19, 29) (19, 12) (3, 21) (3, 23) (3, 12) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 0) (10, 21) (10, 13) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 25) (16, 2) (22, 27) (22, 17) (28, 8) (28, 13) (28, 25) (28, 2) (11, 17) (11, 20) (23, 17) (23, 3) (29, 27) (29, 21) (29, 19) (29, 12) (2, 16) (2, 28) (13, 10) (13, 28) (13, 25) (25, 0) (25, 16) (25, 28) (25, 13) (12, 19) (12, 3) (12, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. (21, 15, 27, 22, 17, 14, 18, 26, 1, 7, 21)
2. (7, 21, 3, 12, 19, 29, 27, 22, 17, 11, 20, 0)
3. (8, 4, 16, 25, 13, 28, 2, 26, 18, 0, 20, 7)
4. (16, 4, 0, 20, 11, 17, 14, 18, 26, 1, 6, 7)
5. (18, 26, 8, 24, 1, 6, 7, 21, 15, 27, 29, 19)
6. (19, 5, 6, 7, 1, 26, 18, 14, 17, 22, 27, 15)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <1, (14, 26), 7>
2. <7, (29, 27), 0>
3. <8, (4, 16), 25>
4. <16, (0, 18), 7>
5. <18, (26, 8), 21>
6. <19, (6, 26), 19>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <1, (14, 26), 7>
2. <7, (29, 27), 0>
3. <8, (4, 16), 25>
4. <16, (0, 18), 7>
5. <18, (26, 8), 21>
6. <19, (6, 26), 19>
