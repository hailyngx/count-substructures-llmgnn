Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: 0-1-2-7-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-1-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-9-5-7-0
- Cycle 4: 0-6-7-2-0

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
Cycle 1: <1, (2, 7), 6> - Not chordal
Cycle 2: <0, (1, 2), 3> - Chordal
Cycle 3: <0, (4, 5), 9> - Not chordal
Cycle 4: <0, (6, 7), 2> - Not chordal

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, (1, 2), 3>
