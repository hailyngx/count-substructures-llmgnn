Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 24) (22, 1) (6, 9) (6, 21) (6, 29) (6, 25) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 24) (9, 7) (10, 26) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 29) (17, 23) (17, 19) (17, 5) (15, 0) (15, 4) (15, 2) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 27) (0, 15) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 5) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 8) (28, 26) (28, 7) (28, 19) (26, 10) (26, 20) (26, 28) (26, 29) (4, 9) (4, 15) (4, 27) (4, 5) (27, 10) (27, 20) (27, 4) (21, 6) (21, 18) (7, 9) (7, 28) (7, 24) (7, 8) (16, 19) (3, 12) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 1) (12, 3) (5, 17) (5, 2) (5, 4) (23, 17) (29, 6) (29, 10) (29, 26) (8, 20) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 25) (18, 11) (18, 21) (18, 14) (18, 25) (24, 22) (24, 9) (24, 7) (24, 1) (1, 22) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 24) (25, 6) (25, 8) (25, 18) (19, 17) (19, 28) (19, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-0-15-2-5-4-9-6-21-18-11-8-25
- Cycle 2: 1-14-11-18-21-6-9-4-15-2-0
- Cycle 3: 4-5-2-15-0-1-22-24-9
- Cycle 4: 4-27-20-26-28-19-17-5

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 2 non-adjacent chords: <1, 18>
- Cycle 2 has 2 non-adjacent chords: <1, 18>
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: <22, 9>
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: <4, 17>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles = [2]
