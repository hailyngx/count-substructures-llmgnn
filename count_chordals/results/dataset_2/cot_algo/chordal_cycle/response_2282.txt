Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 2) (3, 4) (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 28) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 16) (10, 0) (10, 23) (10, 28) (22, 7) (23, 10) (23, 26) (23, 1) (23, 27) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 13) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 16) (27, 8) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 19) (2, 25) (18, 26) (18, 16) (18, 29) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 19) (7, 22) (7, 21) (7, 24) (7, 14) (21, 7) (21, 26) (26, 23) (26, 18) (26, 21) (26, 17) (29, 9) (29, 18) (29, 19) (29, 0) (8, 15) (8, 27) (8, 19) (8, 14) (19, 2) (19, 20) (19, 29) (19, 8) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 14) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 29) (0, 13) (17, 3) (17, 26) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 24) (1, 9) (1, 23) (1, 20) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (24, 7) (24, 13) (28, 5) (28, 10) (28, 25) (25, 2) (25, 28) (16, 6) (16, 27) (16, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 3 - 2 - 4 - 3
- Cycle 2: 15 - 20 - 1 - 9 - 15
- Cycle 3: 15 - 5 - 28 - 10 - 0 - 6 - 9 - 1 - 20 - 15
- Cycle 4: 6 - 16 - 27 - 23 - 10 - 28 - 25 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 5: 7 - 22 - 26 - 21 - 7
- Cycle 6: 14 - 4 - 12 - 27 - 8 - 19 - 29 - 18 - 16 - 6 - 0 - 13 - 14
- Cycle 7: 17 - 26 - 21 - 7 - 24 - 13 - 12 - 4 - 2 - 3 - 17

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 2: 15 - 20 - 1 - 9 - 15, Chord: (15, 9)
- Cycle 6: 14 - 4 - 12 - 27 - 8 - 19 - 29 - 18 - 16 - 6 - 0 - 13 - 14, Chord: (14, 27)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [5] chordless cycles found.

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <3, 2, 4, 3>
- <15, 20, 1, 9>
- <14, 4, 12, 27, 8, 19, 29, 18, 16, 6, 0, 13, 14>
- Cycle with chord (15, 9): <15, 20, (15, 9), 1, 9>
- Cycle with chord (14, 27): <14, 4, 12, (14, 27), 8, 19>
