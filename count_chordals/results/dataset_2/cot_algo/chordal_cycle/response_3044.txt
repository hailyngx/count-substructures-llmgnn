Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 19) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 8) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 0) (18, 1) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 7) (5, 18) (5, 12) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 15) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (10, 3) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (13, 1) (13, 17) (13, 19) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 12) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 15) (14, 7) (14, 19) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 19) (7, 18) (7, 14) (19, 16) (19, 13) (19, 14) (19, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
1. Cycle 1-3-0-2-1
2. Cycle 1-3-8-9-1
3. Cycle 1-9-8-3-1
4. Cycle 11-16-19-13-11
5. Cycle 11-16-19-14-11
6. Cycle 11-17-13-19-11
7. Cycle 11-17-13-1-11
8. Cycle 16-19-14-7-16
9. Cycle 16-19-14-17-16
10. Cycle 16-19-14-12-16
11. Cycle 16-19-13-17-16
12. Cycle 16-19-13-1-16
13. Cycle 1-18-5-12-1
14. Cycle 18-5-12-17-18
15. Cycle 18-5-12-19-18
16. Cycle 18-5-12-17-6
17. Cycle 18-7-14-19-18
18. Cycle 18-7-14-17-18
19. Cycle 11-6-0-4-11
20. Cycle 16-11-6-0-16

Step 2:
By checking each cycle, we find that only one cycle is a chordal 4-cycle:
1. <11, (17, 13), 1, (3, 0), 11>

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph, so the final count is [1].
