Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 17) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 18) (10, 4) (11, 8) (11, 12) (17, 7) (17, 2) (5, 12) (5, 3) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 16) (1, 0) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 16) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 0) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 18) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 14) (14, 16) (14, 3) (9, 2) (9, 18) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (12, 11) (12, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 4-7-17-2-4
        - Cycle 2: 4-7-19-6-4
        - Cycle 3: 4-10-4
        - Cycle 4: 4-15-6-19-4
        - Cycle 5: 4-1-13-8-4
        - Cycle 6: 7-17-2-8-7
        - Cycle 7: 7-19-6-15-7
        - Cycle 8: 8-13-1-16-8
        - Cycle 9: 8-11-12-5-8
        - Cycle 10: 13-1-16-18-13
        - Cycle 11: 17-7-19-18-17
        - Cycle 12: 17-2-8-13-17
        - Cycle 13: 19-7-17-2-19
        - Cycle 14: 19-6-15-16-19
        - Cycle 15: 1-4-10-13-1
        - Cycle 16: 1-13-18-0-1
        - Cycle 17: 1-16-7-4-1
        - Cycle 18: 15-4-10-6-15
        - Cycle 19: 15-6-19-18-15
        - Cycle 20: 18-13-8-2-18
        - Cycle 21: 18-16-1-0-18
        - Cycle 22: 18-9-2-17-18
        - Cycle 23: 18-0-1-16-18
        - Cycle 24: 16-7-4-10-16
        - Cycle 25: 16-1-13-8-16
        - Cycle 26: 16-15-6-19-16
        - Cycle 27: 16-18-13-1-16

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: <1, 2>
        - Cycle 4: <4, 18>
        - Cycle 5: <1, 8>
        - Cycle 6: <13, 17>
        - Cycle 7: <6, 7>
        - Cycle 8: <1, 16>
        - Cycle 9: <8, 12>
        - Cycle 10: <1, 18>
        - Cycle 12: <7, 8>
        - Cycle 13: <2, 19>
        - Cycle 14: <6, 7>
        - Cycle 18: <4, 6>
        - Cycle 19: <6, 18>
        - Cycle 20: <8, 18>
        - Cycle 21: <1, 13>
        - Cycle 23: <1, 18>
        - Cycle 24: <4, 10>
        - Cycle 25: <1, 13>
        - Cycle 26: <6, 7>
        - Cycle 27: <1, 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 17 chordal 4-cycles found, so the result is [17].

        Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <4, 18, 15, 6>
        <1, 16, 7, 4>
        <1, 13, 8, 18>
        <6, 18, 15, 19>
        <8, 12, 11, 13>
        <1, 2, 17, 7>
        <8, 2, 17, 18>
        <1, 18, 9, 2>
        <4, 6, 15, 19>
        <13, 17, 7, 4>
        <1, 8, 13, 0>
        <6, 7, 17, 2>
        <1, 2, 19, 6>
        <1, 13, 1, 0>
        <1, 16, 1, 0>
        <4, 18, 16, 1>
        <7, 8, 13, 1>
