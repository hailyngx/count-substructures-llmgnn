Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 1) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 2) (10, 15) (10, 16) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 3) (2, 15) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 17) (3, 14) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 19) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 16) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 14) (8, 7) (8, 6) (19, 17) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 18) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <5, 9, 7, 4>
- Cycle <5, 13, 1, 11>
- Cycle <5, 6, 4, 7>
- Cycle <5, 6, 8, 7>
- Cycle <9, 7, 4, 12>
- Cycle <4, 12, 2, 3>
- Cycle <4, 14, 3, 12>
- Cycle <7, 4, 12, 2>
- Cycle <7, 8, 6, 5>
- Cycle <13, 1, 0, 18>
- Cycle <1, 18, 0, 17>
- Cycle <1, 11, 2, 15>
- Cycle <15, 18, 0, 17>
- Cycle <15, 2, 12, 3>
- Cycle <10, 15, 18, 1>
- Cycle <10, 16, 14, 3>
- Cycle <12, 2, 15, 18>
- Cycle <12, 3, 14, 16>
- Cycle <2, 11, 1, 13>
- Cycle <2, 15, 18, 0>
- Cycle <2, 3, 14, 16>
- Cycle <3, 14, 16, 10>
- Cycle <3, 12, 4, 6>
- Cycle <3, 17, 0, 18>
- Cycle <17, 0, 1, 13>
- Cycle <17, 3, 12, 4>
- Cycle <17, 16, 14, 4>
- Cycle <14, 16, 17, 3>
- Cycle <16, 10, 15, 2>
- Cycle <16, 14, 4, 7>
- Cycle <8, 7, 4, 12>
- Cycle <8, 6, 4, 14>
- Cycle <18, 0, 1, 13>
- Cycle <18, 0, 17, 19>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 9, 7, 4> with chord (5, 7)

Step 3:
There is one unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
