Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (4, 12) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 11) (12, 9) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (10, 8) (10, 6) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-5-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-11-13-8-1
- Cycle 3: 1-5-6-2-1
- Cycle 4: 3-0-5-4-3
- Cycle 5: 3-13-9-7-3
- Cycle 6: 3-8-2-4-3
- Cycle 7: 8-13-9-12-8
- Cycle 8: 8-2-6-12-8
- Cycle 9: 13-11-12-14-13
- Cycle 10: 4-12-14-7-4
- Cycle 11: 5-6-10-8-5
- Cycle 12: 6-1-11-12-6
- Cycle 13: 2-8-10-6-2
- Cycle 14: 0-3-9-7-0

Step 2:

Out of the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (6, 4), 5>
- <1, (11, 13), 8>
- <1, (5, 6), 2>
- <3, (0, 5), 4>
- <3, (13, 9), 7>
- <3, (8, 2), 4>
- <8, (13, 9), 12>
- <8, (2, 6), 12>
- <13, (11, 12), 14>
- <4, (12, 14), 7>
- <5, (6, 10), 8>
- <6, (1, 11), 12>
- <2, (8, 10), 6>
- <0, (3, 9), 7>

Step 3:

The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
