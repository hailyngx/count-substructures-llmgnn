Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 29) (4, 15) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 11) (21, 25) (21, 29) (6, 15) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 24) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 26) (13, 27) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 1) (22, 11) (22, 24) (26, 13) (26, 20) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 15) (28, 16) (28, 14) (28, 23) (25, 7) (25, 21) (25, 11) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 1) (17, 12) (17, 23) (17, 2) (5, 19) (5, 10) (5, 27) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 29) (19, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 27) (11, 7) (11, 22) (11, 25) (11, 2) (20, 26) (20, 27) (20, 10) (24, 8) (24, 22) (24, 23) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 11) (2, 14) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 19) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 16) (15, 18) (29, 4) (29, 21) (29, 16) (29, 19) (27, 13) (27, 5) (27, 3) (27, 20) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 20) (14, 28) (14, 18) (14, 2) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 18) (23, 28) (23, 17) (23, 24) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 7-11-25-21
- Cycle 2: 8-13-27-20
- Cycle 3: 9-0-19-29
- Cycle 4: 12-17-23-24
- Cycle 5: 14-18-15-16

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <7, (11, 25), 21>
- <8, (13, 27), 20>
- <9, (0, 19), 29>
- <12, (17, 23), 24>
- <14, (18, 15), 16>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]
