Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 19) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 18) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 9) (16, 12) (16, 14) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 1) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 15) (0, 2) (0, 11) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 18) (9, 12) (9, 2) (9, 15) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 19) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 11) (18, 7) (7, 18) (19, 6) (19, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 5, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 17, 18, 15, 14, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 17, 18, 11, 0, 2, 9, 12, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 12, 9, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1)
- Cycle 5: (14, 15, 18, 17, 6, 5, 4, 2, 9, 15, 14)
- Cycle 6: (3, 14, 15, 18, 17, 6, 5, 4, 2, 9, 15, 10, 13, 3)
- Cycle 7: (13, 10, 1, 6, 5, 4, 2, 9, 15, 18, 17, 12, 16, 14, 3, 13)
- Cycle 8: (0, 2, 9, 12, 1, 6, 17, 18, 15, 14, 3, 13, 11, 8, 4, 5, 6, 1)
- Cycle 9: (11, 0, 2, 9, 12, 16, 14, 15, 18, 17, 6, 5, 4, 8, 11)
- Cycle 10: (15, 18, 17, 12, 9, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 10, 13, 3, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Only Cycle 4: (1, 12, 9, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1) has exactly one chord (9, 5) connecting non-adjacent nodes 9 and 5.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle in the given graph, so the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (9, 5), 12, 2, 1>
