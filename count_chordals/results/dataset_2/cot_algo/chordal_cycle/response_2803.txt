Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:  
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 8, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 6, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 2, 8, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 0, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 4, 0, 6, 9)
- Cycle 6: (6, 1, 9, 4, 6)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 2, 5, 4)
- Cycle 8: (8, 7, 6, 1, 8)
- Cycle 9: (2, 3, 7, 6, 2)
- Cycle 10: (0, 5, 2, 3, 0)
- Cycle 11: (7, 1, 6, 0, 7)
- Cycle 12: (1, 9, 5, 0, 1)
- Cycle 13: (3, 8, 2, 5, 3)
- Cycle 14: (3, 7, 1, 9, 3)
- Cycle 15: (5, 2, 8, 3, 5)
- Cycle 16: (9, 4, 8, 7, 9)
- Cycle 17: (6, 1, 7, 3, 6)
- Cycle 18: (4, 0, 3, 7, 4)
- Cycle 19: (8, 2, 3, 0, 8)
- Cycle 20: (2, 5, 0, 6, 2)

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- <5, (9, 4), 8, 5>
- <5, (6, 1), 9, 5>
- <5, (2, 8), 4, 5>
- <5, (0, 6), 7, 5>
- <9, (4, 0), 6, 9>
- <6, (1, 9), 4, 6>
- <4, (8, 2), 5, 4>
- <8, (7, 6), 1, 8>
- <2, (3, 7), 6, 2>
- <0, (5, 2), 3, 0>
- <7, (1, 6), 0, 7>
- <1, (9, 5), 0, 1>
- <8, (3, 2), 5, 8>
- <7, (1, 9), 3, 7>
- <5, (2, 8), 3, 5>
- <9, (4, 8), 7, 9>
- <6, (1, 7), 3, 6>
- <4, (0, 3), 7, 4>
- <8, (2, 3), 0, 8>
- <2, (5, 0), 6, 2>

Step 3:
There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [20].
