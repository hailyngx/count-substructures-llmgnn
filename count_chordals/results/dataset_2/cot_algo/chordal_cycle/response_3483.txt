Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 2) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 1-3-8-9-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-9-13-1
- Cycle 3: 4-9-8-11-4
- Cycle 4: 0-3-8-11-0
- Cycle 5: 2-7-0-3-2
- Cycle 6: 5-6-10-9-5
- Cycle 7: 7-2-1-13-7
- Cycle 8: 12-1-13-9-12
- Cycle 9: 14-3-8-9-14
- Cycle 10: 2-0-7-5-2
- Cycle 11: 11-4-1-2-11
- Cycle 12: 0-7-5-12-0
- Cycle 13: 14-0-11-8-14
- Cycle 14: 6-10-8-11-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The unique chordal 4-cycle is: <1, 13, 8, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There is 13 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
