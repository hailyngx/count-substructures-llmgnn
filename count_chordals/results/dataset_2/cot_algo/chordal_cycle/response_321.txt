Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 6) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 22) (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 20) (15, 3) (15, 24) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 25) (22, 21) (22, 23) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 20) (23, 9) (10, 13) (10, 29) (17, 18) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 11) (26, 25) (26, 27) (29, 10) (29, 17) (29, 20) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 14) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 4) (28, 19) (28, 13) (4, 28) (4, 27) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 2) (27, 26) (27, 4) (27, 16) (27, 6) (16, 12) (16, 27) (13, 10) (13, 17) (13, 28) (20, 3) (20, 23) (20, 29) (20, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (6, 1) (6, 27) (6, 25) (9, 23) (9, 20) (9, 24) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 25) (5, 24) (19, 28) (19, 4) (19, 2) (25, 18) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 2) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 23) (0, 4) (24, 15) (24, 9) (24, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<1, 21, 22, 23, 0>
<3, 15, 24, 5>
<3, 11, 18, 25, 6>
<17, 18, 25, 2>
<17, 11, 7, 12, 16>
<17, 29, 20, 9, 24>
<7, 11, 28, 19, 2>
<27, 4, 0, 23, 20>
<12, 7, 11, 17, 13>
<12, 16, 27, 6, 1>
<13, 17, 18, 25, 26>
<13, 28, 4, 2, 14>
<20, 3, 11, 18, 17>
<20, 23, 0, 1, 6>
<25, 18, 11, 7, 12>
<25, 26, 27, 6, 1>
<2, 4, 0, 23, 9>
<2, 14, 12, 7, 11>
<19, 28, 13, 10, 29>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<3, (15, 24), 5>
<17, (18, 25), 2>
<17, (11, 7), 16>
<17, (29, 20), 9>
<7, (11, 28), 19>
<27, (4, 0), 23>
<12, (7, 11), 17>
<13, (17, 18), 25>
<13, (28, 4), 2>
<20, (3, 11), 18>
<20, (23, 0), 1>
<25, (18, 11), 7>
<25, (26, 27), 6>
<2, (4, 0), 23>
<2, (14, 12), 7>
<19, (28, 13), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [16].
