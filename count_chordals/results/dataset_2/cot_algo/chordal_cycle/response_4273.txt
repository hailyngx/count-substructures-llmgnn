Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 18) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 14) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 17) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 4) (6, 11) (6, 17) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 14) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 19) (15, 19) (15, 17) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 18) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 15) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 16) (16, 9) (16, 14) (16, 18) (16, 4) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 1) (4, 16) (18, 8) (18, 3) (18, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 16, 14, 8, 13, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 13, 14, 16, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (10, 0, 5, 4, 1, 12, 1, 7, 2, 10)

- Cycle 5: (10, 0, 19, 3, 18, 16, 9, 5, 0)
- Cycle 6: (10, 2, 7, 1, 4, 16, 9, 5, 0)
- Cycle 7: (11, 4, 5, 9, 16, 14, 13, 11)
- Cycle 8: (11, 4, 16, 9, 5, 0, 19, 3, 18, 11)
- Cycle 9: (11, 17, 15, 19, 0, 10, 2, 7, 1, 11)
- Cycle 10: (11, 17, 15, 19, 3, 0, 5, 9, 16, 11)
- Cycle 11: (11, 17, 15, 19, 3, 18, 16, 14, 13, 11)
- Cycle 12: (6, 11, 4, 5, 13, 14, 16, 6)
- Cycle 13: (6, 11, 17, 15, 19, 0, 10, 2, 6)
- Cycle 14: (7, 1, 4, 5, 9, 16, 14, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 2, 14, 16, 9, 5, 0, 10, 7)
- Cycle 16: (12, 1, 4, 5, 13, 14, 12)
- Cycle 17: (2, 10, 0, 5, 13, 14, 2)
- Cycle 18: (2, 7, 1, 4, 5, 9, 16, 2)
- Cycle 19: (2, 14, 16, 9, 5, 0, 10, 2)
- Cycle 20: (0, 5, 9, 16, 14, 13, 0)
- Cycle 21: (0, 10, 2, 7, 1, 4, 0)
- Cycle 22: (0, 19, 3, 18, 16, 14, 0)
- Cycle 23: (3, 10, 0, 5, 9, 16, 3)
- Cycle 24: (3, 18, 16, 9, 5, 0, 3)
- Cycle 25: (17, 11, 4, 5, 9, 16, 17)
- Cycle 26: (17, 15, 19, 0, 10, 2, 17)
- Cycle 27: (14, 8, 13, 5, 9, 16, 14)
- Cycle 28: (14, 2, 10, 0, 5, 13, 14)
- Cycle 29: (14, 16, 9, 5, 0, 10, 14)
- Cycle 30: (16, 9, 5, 13, 14, 2, 10, 16)
- Cycle 31: (16, 18, 3, 0, 5, 9, 16)
- Cycle 32: (4, 5, 9, 16, 14, 13, 4)
- Cycle 33: (18, 8, 13, 5, 9, 16, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 7 has exactly one chord (16, 14).

Step 3:
Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <7, (16, 14)>
