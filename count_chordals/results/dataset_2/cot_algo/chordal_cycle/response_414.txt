Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 7 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 3 - 6 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 4: 9 - 8 - 7 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 5: 9 - 8 - 0 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 6: 1 - 9 - 0 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 7: 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 1

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 0 - 5 has one chord 6 - 0.
- Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 7 - 6 - 5 has one chord 4 - 7.
- Cycle 3: 5 - 3 - 6 - 2 - 5 has one chord 3 - 2.
- Cycle 4: 9 - 8 - 7 - 4 - 9 has one chord 8 - 7.
- Cycle 5: 9 - 8 - 0 - 6 - 9 has one chord 8 - 0.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is 5.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, 2, 3, 5> 
- <4, 7, (5,6), 5>
- <5, 6, (0,6), 9>
- <3, 2, (5,6), 5>
- <9, 8, (4,7), 9>
