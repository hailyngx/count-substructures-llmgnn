Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-8-9-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-7-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-9-6-0
- Cycle 4: 0-3-4-8-0
- Cycle 5: 0-3-5-7-0
- Cycle 6: 1-4-9-6-1
- Cycle 7: 1-5-8-4-1
- Cycle 8: 2-6-9-8-2
- Cycle 9: 2-7-5-3-2
- Cycle 10: 3-4-1-9-3
- Cycle 11: 3-5-7-2-3
- Cycle 12: 4-8-5-7-4
- Cycle 13: 6-9-8-5-6
- Cycle 14: 6-7-2-0-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0-1-7-2-0> (Chord: (1, 7))
- <0-1-9-6-0> (Chord: (1, 9))
- <0-3-5-7-0> (Chord: (3, 7))
- <1-4-9-6-1> (Chord: (9, 4))
- <2-6-9-8-2> (Chord: (6, 8))
- <3-4-1-9-3> (Chord: (4, 9))
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0-1-7-2-0>
<0-1-9-6-0>
<0-3-5-7-0>
<1-4-9-6-1>
<2-6-9-8-2>
<3-4-1-9-3>
