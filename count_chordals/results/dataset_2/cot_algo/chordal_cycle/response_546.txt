Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 14) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 10) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (5, 10) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (9, 12) (9, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (4, 8, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 8, 1, 6, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 6, 2, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 8, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 12, 13, 14, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 12, 11, 3, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 12, 11, 9, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 6, 2, 8, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 6, 1, 8, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 6, 8, 2, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 6, 8, 1, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 10, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 10, 5, 3, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 10, 9, 12, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 3, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 16: (4, 3, 5, 10, 4)
- Cycle 17: (4, 3, 11, 12, 4)
- Cycle 18: (4, 3, 9, 11, 4)
- Cycle 19: (7, 9, 0, 5, 7)
- Cycle 20: (8, 14, 13, 12, 8)
- Cycle 21: (8, 14, 1, 11, 8)
- Cycle 22: (8, 1, 11, 9, 8)
- Cycle 23: (13, 12, 9, 11, 13)
- Cycle 24: (2, 6, 1, 5, 2)
- Cycle 25: (2, 6, 10, 4, 2)
- Cycle 26: (2, 10, 9, 12, 2)
- Cycle 27: (2, 3, 5, 1, 2)
- Cycle 28: (13, 14, 8, 4, 13)
- Cycle 29: (0, 5, 1, 6, 0)
- Cycle 30: (9, 7, 0, 5, 9)

Step 2:

The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (6, 8), 4>
- <5, (3, 4), 10>
- <9, (11, 12), 4>
- <0, (1, 6), 5>
- <7, (0, 5), 9>

Step 3:

There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [5].
