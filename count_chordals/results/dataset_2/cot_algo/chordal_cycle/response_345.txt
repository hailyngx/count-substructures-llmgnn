Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 4 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 5 - 9 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 5 - 7 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 4: 1 - 4 - 5 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 4 - 6 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 6: 2 - 6 - 4 - 8 - 2
- Cycle 7: 2 - 6 - 9 - 5 - 2
- Cycle 8: 2 - 8 - 4 - 5 - 2
- Cycle 9: 3 - 4 - 5 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 10: 3 - 4 - 8 - 2 - 3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal cycles in the graph are:
- Chordal cycle 1: <0, (5, 9), 6>
- Chordal cycle 2: <1, (4, 5), 6>
- Chordal cycle 3: <2, (6, 4), 8>
- Chordal cycle 4: <2, (6, 9), 5>
- Chordal cycle 5: <2, (8, 4), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

In this graph, there are 5 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
