Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 6) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 3) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 6) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 11) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 19) (10, 14) (10, 15) (15, 4) (15, 10) (0, 18) (0, 5) (16, 8) (16, 12) (18, 0) (18, 19) (18, 11) (19, 13) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 11) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 18) (11, 19) (12, 16) (12, 3) (12, 9) (3, 14) (3, 17) (3, 8) (3, 12) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 2) (9, 2) (9, 12) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <4, 7, 6, 4>
2. Cycle <14, 17, 3, 14>
3. Cycle <14, 2, 6, 4>
4. Cycle <13, 8, 3, 12>
5. Cycle <13, 1, 11, 14>
6. Cycle <13, 6, 2, 14>
7. Cycle <13, 19, 18, 0>
8. Cycle <13, 19, 11, 1>
9. Cycle <13, 19, 1, 11>
10. Cycle <8, 3, 14, 2>
11. Cycle <8, 3, 12, 16>
12. Cycle <8, 13, 6, 4>
13. Cycle <3, 14, 17, 3>
14. Cycle <3, 12, 16, 8>
15. Cycle <6, 4, 7, 6>
16. Cycle <6, 13, 8, 3>
17. Cycle <6, 2, 14, 11>
18. Cycle <14, 11, 19, 13>
19. Cycle <11, 1, 13, 6>
20. Cycle <11, 18, 19, 13>

Step 2:
- The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<13, 19, 18, 0> with chord (13, 19)
<13, 19, 11, 1> with chord (13, 19)
<13, 19, 1, 11> with chord (13, 1)
<8, 3, 14, 2> with chord (8, 14)
<8, 3, 12, 16> with chord (8, 12)
<14, 11, 19, 13> with chord (14, 19)

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we get a total of [14].
