Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 15) (17, 18) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 15) (7, 16) (12, 6) (12, 1) (2, 14) (2, 6) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 1) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 19) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 19) (19, 8) (19, 0) (19, 15) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 18) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 0) (3, 17) (3, 4) (3, 6) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 13) (18, 17) (18, 10) (18, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph. One such cycle is <0, 19, 15, 8, 4, 9>. Some other cycles are <2, 14, 15, 8, 4>, <5, 11, 13, 1, 9>, <10, 6, 2, 14, 15>, etc.

Step 2:
Among the cycles identified in Step 1, let's check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 19, 15, 8, 4, 9> has one chord 4-15.
- <2, 14, 15, 8, 4> has one chord 8-15.
- <5, 11, 13, 1, 9> has one chord 1-13.
- <10, 6, 2, 14, 15> has one chord 6-14.
- <6, 3, 4, 8, 15> has one chord 3-8.

Step 3:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. Therefore, the final count is [5].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 19, 15, (4), 8>
- <2, 14, (15), 8, 4>
- <5, 11, 13, (1), 9>
- <10, (6), 2, 14, 15>
- <6, 3, 4, (8), 15>
