Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 2 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 7 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 4 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 4 - 7 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 7 - 1 - 9
- Cycle 7: 9 - 2 - 1 - 9
- Cycle 8: 4 - 7 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 9: 1 - 7 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 10: 1 - 2 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 11: 3 - 2 - 9 - 3
- Cycle 12: 7 - 6 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 13: 6 - 8 - 5 - 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has a chord: 4 - 1.
- Cycle 4 has a chord: 3 - 2.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has no chord.
- Cycle 8 has a chord: 7 - 1.
- Cycle 9 has a chord: 7 - 9.
- Cycle 10 has no chord.
- Cycle 11 has no chord.
- Cycle 12 has no chord.
- Cycle 13 has a chord: 8 - 5.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles in total: [10].

The unique chordal cycles are:
- <1, 4, 7, 9> with chord (1, 7)
- <1, 4, 7, 9> with chord (7, 9)
- <3, 2, 1, 5> with chord (3, 2)
