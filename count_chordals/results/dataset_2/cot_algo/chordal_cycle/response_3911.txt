Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 0) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 1) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 4, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 10, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 1, 13, 6, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 2, 8, 7, 5>
- Cycle 5: <9, 6, 13, 1, 9>
- Cycle 6: <9, 14, 1, 0, 9>
- Cycle 7: <6, 4, 7, 8, 6>
- Cycle 8: <4, 7, 10, 11, 4>
- Cycle 9: <7, 10, 11, 12, 7>
- Cycle 10: <10, 5, 1, 13, 10>
- Cycle 11: <11, 4, 6, 13, 11>
  
Step 2:
- Checking for chords in the cycles:
  - In Cycle 1: Chords are (9, 6)
  - In Cycle 2: Chords are (10, 7)
  - In Cycle 3: Chords are (1, 13)
  - In Cycle 4: Chords are (2, 8)
  - In Cycle 5: Chords are (9, 1)
  - In Cycle 6: Chords are (14, 0)
  - In Cycle 7: Chords are (4, 7)
  - In Cycle 8: Chords are (7, 10)
  - In Cycle 9: Chords are (10, 11)
  - In Cycle 10: Chords are (5, 13)
  - In Cycle 11: Chords are (11, 6)
  
Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [11]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, 9, 6, 4> with chords (9, 6)
- <5, 10, 7, 4> with chords (10, 7)
- <5, 1, 13, 6> with chords (1, 13)
- <5, 2, 8, 7> with chords (2, 8)
- <9, 6, 13, 1> with chords (9, 1)
- <9, 14, 1, 0> with chords (14, 0)
- <6, 4, 7, 8> with chords (4, 7)
- <4, 7, 10, 11> with chords (7, 10)
- <7, 10, 11, 12> with chords (10, 11)
- <10, 5, 1, 13> with chords (5, 13)
- <11, 4, 6, 13> with chords (11, 6)
