Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 8, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 2, 4, 9, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 6, 5, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 8, 5, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 4, 6, 9)
- Cycle 7: (6, 1, 0, 4, 6)
- Cycle 8: (1, 6, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 9: (4, 9, 8, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 8, 5, 2, 4)
- Cycle 12: (8, 9, 6, 4, 8)
- Cycle 13: (8, 4, 9, 8)
- Cycle 14: (8, 2, 3, 7, 8)
- Cycle 15: (2, 5, 7, 3, 2)
- Cycle 16: (0, 1, 6, 5, 0)
- Cycle 17: (0, 4, 9, 8, 0)
- Cycle 18: (7, 5, 8, 0, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Only Cycle 10: (4, 6, 9, 4) has exactly one chord (6, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There is **one** unique chordal 4-cycle found, which is [(4, 6, 9, 4)].

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
