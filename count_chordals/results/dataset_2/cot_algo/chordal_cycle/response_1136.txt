Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 17) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 29) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (10, 11) (10, 26) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 17) (12, 13) (12, 28) (12, 26) (27, 23) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 8) (17, 9) (17, 11) (17, 22) (29, 4) (29, 0) (29, 23) (21, 2) (21, 6) (28, 12) (28, 0) (28, 19) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 18) (13, 12) (13, 26) (13, 16) (13, 20) (26, 10) (26, 12) (26, 13) (26, 25) (26, 3) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 26) (3, 6) (6, 7) (6, 21) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 20) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 15) (19, 28) (19, 15) (19, 1) (23, 27) (23, 29) (22, 2) (22, 17) (22, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 22) (14, 16) (15, 4) (15, 25) (15, 19) (1, 2) (1, 19) (20, 13) (20, 6) (0, 29) (0, 28) (0, 6) (16, 13) (16, 25) (16, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <9, 8, 2, 22, 17>
- <4, 7, 8, 2, 18, 6>
- <26, 10, 11, 17, 22, 14>
- <26, 10, 11, 14, 16, 25>
- <26, 12, 13, 20, 6, 0>
- <26, 12, 13, 16, 25, 15>
- <26, 12, 13, 20, 6, 3>
- <26, 25, 16, 14, 4, 15>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <9, 8, 2, 22, 17> <(8, 22)>
- <4, 7, 8, 2, 18, 6> <(7, 18)>
- <26, 10, 11, 17, 22, 14> <(10, 22)>
- <26, 10, 11, 14, 16, 25> <(10, 16)>
- <26, 12, 13, 20, 6, 0> <(12, 6)>
- <26, 12, 13, 16, 25, 15> <(13, 25)>
- <26, 12, 13, 20, 6, 3> <(13, 6)>
- <26, 25, 16, 14, 4, 15> <(25, 4)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [8].
