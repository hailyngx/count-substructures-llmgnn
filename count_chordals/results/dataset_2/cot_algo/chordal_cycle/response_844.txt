This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 29) (16, 15) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 9) (21, 3) (21, 8) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 19) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 1) (4, 27) (4, 20) (8, 21) (8, 2) (8, 17) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 15) (29, 16) (29, 14) (29, 24) (2, 27) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 25) (24, 29) (24, 26) (24, 20) (26, 24) (26, 18) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 22) (5, 10) (13, 5) (13, 25) (13, 0) (13, 18) (18, 26) (18, 13) (18, 28) (18, 1) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 23) (3, 21) (3, 28) (3, 10) (3, 6) (14, 29) (14, 19) (28, 18) (28, 3) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 14) (23, 0) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 10) (25, 2) (25, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 22) (20, 4) (20, 24) (20, 22) (1, 27) (1, 5) (1, 18) (6, 3) (6, 15) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 20) (15, 16) (15, 17) (15, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 29, 24, 26, 18, 13, 5, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 16, 29, 24, 26, 18, 28, 3, 21, 8, 17, 12, 27, 4, 20, 24)
- Cycle 3: (11, 16, 29, 24, 20, 22, 5, 11)
- Cycle 4: (11, 16, 15, 17, 12, 27, 4, 20, 24, 26, 18, 13, 5, 11)
- Cycle 5: (7, 0, 13, 18, 26, 24, 29, 16, 15, 6, 3, 21, 8, 17, 12, 27, 4, 20, 22, 5, 11, 16)
- Cycle 6: (7, 0, 13, 18, 1, 5, 11, 16, 15, 6, 3, 21, 8, 17, 12, 27, 4, 20, 24, 26, 28)
- Cycle 7: (7, 0, 23, 13, 18, 26, 24, 29, 16, 15, 17, 8, 21, 3, 6, 15)
- Cycle 8: (7, 19, 12, 17, 15, 6, 3, 21, 8, 2, 27, 4, 20, 24, 26, 18, 13, 5, 11, 16, 15)
- Cycle 9: (7, 19, 14, 29, 24, 26, 18, 13, 5, 22, 20, 4, 27, 12, 17, 8, 21, 3, 6, 15)
  
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (12, 19) 
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (17, 15)
  
Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Putting this final number inside brackets, the answer is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (12, 19), 5, 11>
- <1, (17, 15), 15>
