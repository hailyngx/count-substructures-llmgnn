Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 12) (1, 9) (1, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 14) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 10) 

Response:
To find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, we first need to identify all cycles of length 4 or more. 

1. List of cycles with 4 or more vertices:
- Cycle 1: 2-6-9-4-2
- Cycle 2: 2-6-3-0-2
- Cycle 3: 2-6-3-12-2
- Cycle 4: 2-6-9-1-11-2

2. Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 (2-6-9-4-2): Chord: (6, 4)
- Cycle 2 (2-6-3-0-2): Chord: (6, 0)
- Cycle 3 (2-6-3-12-2): Chord: (6, 12)
- Cycle 4 (2-6-9-1-11-2): Chord: (6, 1)

3. Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (6, 4)>
<2, (6, 0)>
<3, (6, 12)>
<4, (6, 1)>
