Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 17) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 4) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 5) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 10) (19, 3) (10, 19) (10, 12) (10, 9) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 11) (0, 4) (16, 0) (16, 9) (18, 6) (18, 7) (18, 17) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 18) (6, 18) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 3) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 18) (17, 6) (17, 9) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 6) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 0) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 17) (12, 10) (12, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle 1: 3-13-11-0-3
2. Cycle 2: 2-4-19-10-2
3. Cycle 3: 3-6-18-7-3
4. Cycle 4: 3-19-4-0-3
5. Cycle 5: 7-18-17-9-7
6. Cycle 6: 7-5-19-4-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

1. Cycle 1: <3, (13, 0), 11>
2. Cycle 2: <2, (4, 10), 19>
3. Cycle 3: <3, (6, 18), 7>
4. Cycle 4: <3, (19, 4), 0>
5. Cycle 5: <7, (18, 17), 9>
6. Cycle 6: <7, (5, 19), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
