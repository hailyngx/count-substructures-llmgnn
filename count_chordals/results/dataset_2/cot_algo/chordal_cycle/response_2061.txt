Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- <11, 5, 26, 27> has a chord: (5, 26)
- <11, 5, 24, 10> has a chord: (5, 24)
- <11, 20, 8, 3> has a chord: (8, 20)
- <16, 29, 9, 22> has a chord: (9, 22)
- <16, 29, 8, 3> has a chord: (8, 29)
- <16, 21, 26, 27> has a chord: (16, 27)
- <15, 0, 13, 3> has a chord: (0, 3)
- <15, 12, 22, 2> has a chord: (12, 22)
- <27, 12, 22, 9> has a chord: (12, 22)
- <27, 26, 5, 11> has a chord: (5, 11)
- <1, 7, 18, 14> has a chord: (1, 18)
- <8, 3, 13, 0> has a chord: (3, 13)
- <8, 20, 23, 22> has a chord: (20, 23)
- <29, 16, 21, 6> has a chord: (21, 6)
- <10, 17, 7, 1> has a chord: (7, 17)
- <21, 6, 25, 22> has a chord: (6, 25)
- <6, 25, 22, 9> has a chord: (6, 9)
- <2, 24, 5, 26> has a chord: (5, 26)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 17 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [17].
