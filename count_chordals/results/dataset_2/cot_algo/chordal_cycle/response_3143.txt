Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 4) (16, 10) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 2) (17, 13) (17, 19) (10, 16) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 15) (18, 19) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 13) (13, 17) (13, 18) (4, 16) (4, 6) (4, 15) (12, 16) (12, 2) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 18) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 5) (3, 14) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 8) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 0) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 10-16-4-6-10
- Cycle 2: 9-10-7-3-9
- Cycle 3: 6-4-15-2-6
- Cycle 4: 0-6-9-1-0
- Cycle 5: 18-19-17-13-18
- Cycle 6: 15-4-16-10-15
- Cycle 7: 3-7-5-0-3
- Cycle 8: 8-1-10-9-8

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (9, 8), 10, 16>
- <3, (7, 5), 0, 6>
- <4, (15, 16), 2, 6>

Step 3: 
There are [3] chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
