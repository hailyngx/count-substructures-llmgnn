Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-7-3-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-7-2-6-0
- Cycle 3: 0-7-2-9-1-0
- Cycle 4: 0-7-2-1-8-5-0

Step 2:
Checking for a single chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: 0-7-3-6-0 does not have any chords.
- Cycle 2: <0, (7, 2), 6> has one chord (7, 2).
- Cycle 3: 0-7-2-9-1-0 does not have any chords.
- Cycle 4: <0, (7, 2), 5, 8> has one chord (7, 2).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, (7, 2), 6>
- <0, (7, 2), 5, 8>
