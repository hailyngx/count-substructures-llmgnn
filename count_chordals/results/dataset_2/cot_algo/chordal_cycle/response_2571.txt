Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 11) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 2) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

        - Cycle 1: 1 - 9 - 6 - 5 - 1
        - Cycle 2: 1 - 9 - 2 - 13 - 4 - 1
        - Cycle 3: 1 - 9 - 0 - 2 - 13 - 4 - 1
        - Cycle 4: 1 - 9 - 0 - 8 - 14 - 11 - 4 - 1
        - Cycle 5: 3 - 6 - 5 - 3
        - Cycle 6: 3 - 6 - 5 - 7 - 11 - 4 - 13 - 3
        - Cycle 7: 3 - 6 - 5 - 11 - 14 - 8 - 3
        - Cycle 8: 3 - 6 - 9 - 10 - 2 - 5 - 3
        - Cycle 9: 3 - 1 - 4 - 11 - 7 - 12 - 3
        - Cycle 10: 5 - 6 - 9 - 10 - 12 - 7 - 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

        - Cycle 5 has one chord: (3, 5)
        - Cycle 6 has one chord: (6, 13)
        - Cycle 7 has one chord: (6, 14)
        - Cycle 8 has one chord: (9, 5)
        - Cycle 9 has one chord: (1, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

        There are 6 chordless cycles: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <1, (2, 13), 4)>
        <1, (2, 13), 0, 8, 14, 11, 4)>
        <3, 5, 6, 9>
        <3, 6, 5, 7, 11, 14, 8>
        <3, 6, 5, 11, 4, 13>
        <5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 7>
