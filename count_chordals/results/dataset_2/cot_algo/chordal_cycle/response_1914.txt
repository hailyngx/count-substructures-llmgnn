Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 14) (15, 17) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 16) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 11) (17, 15) (17, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 28) (1, 19) (3, 1) (3, 12) (22, 23) (22, 18) (22, 4) (22, 16) (22, 5) (23, 22) (23, 0) (23, 20) (18, 22) (18, 26) (18, 19) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 29) (4, 26) (8, 6) (5, 22) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 28) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 23) (0, 10) (28, 1) (28, 6) (28, 24) (28, 13) (24, 28) (24, 26) (24, 9) (26, 18) (26, 4) (26, 24) (21, 20) (21, 12) (21, 11) (7, 29) (7, 10) (7, 9) (25, 19) (9, 4) (9, 24) (9, 7) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 25) (19, 10) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 19) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 21) (11, 13) (2, 15) (29, 4) (29, 7) (29, 13) (20, 23) (20, 21) (13, 28) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 29) (12, 3) (12, 5) (12, 21) (16, 27) (16, 22) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (0, 14, 15, 17, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 11, 14, 15, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 11, 21, 12, 1)
- Cycle 4: (4, 9, 24, 26, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 9, 29, 7, 4)
- Cycle 6: (5, 12, 21, 11, 5)
- Cycle 7: (6, 8, 28, 1, 6)
- Cycle 8: (7, 9, 29, 13, 7)
- Cycle 9: (10, 0, 14, 11, 10)
- Cycle 10: (10, 13, 29, 4, 10)
- Cycle 11: (11, 13, 29, 4, 11)
- Cycle 12: (12, 21, 22, 16, 12)
- Cycle 13: (14, 15, 17, 0, 14)
- Cycle 14: (15, 2, 27, 16, 15)
- Cycle 15: (16, 22, 18, 26, 16)
- Cycle 16: (18, 22, 4, 26, 18)
- Cycle 17: (19, 1, 11, 21, 19)
- Cycle 18: (19, 10, 0, 23, 19)
- Cycle 19: (20, 23, 22, 16, 20)
- Cycle 20: (21, 11, 14, 15, 21)
- Cycle 21: (21, 12, 5, 22, 21)
- Cycle 22: (22, 16, 27, 15, 22)
- Cycle 23: (24, 26, 18, 22, 24)
- Cycle 24: (25, 19, 1, 28, 25)
- Cycle 25: (27, 15, 14, 11, 27)
- Cycle 26: (28, 1, 11, 21, 28)
- Cycle 27: (29, 7, 10, 0, 29)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chorded Cycles:
- <1, (2, 27), 16>
- <4, (5, 9), 24>
- <7, (9, 29), 13>
- <10, (0, 14), 11>
- <12, (21, 22), 16>
- <14, (15, 17), 0>
- <18, (22, 26), 4>
- <19, (1, 11), 21>
- <20, (16, 22), 18>
- <25, (1, 28), 19>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [17].
