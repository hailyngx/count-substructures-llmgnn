Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4: 
- (1, 5, 8, 4, 1)
- (1, 5, 6, 7, 1)
- (1, 9, 2, 7, 1)
- (1, 9, 7, 6, 1)
- (1, 3, 4, 9, 1)
- (4, 9, 2, 7, 4)
- (4, 9, 1, 5, 4)
- (4, 9, 1, 7, 4)
- (4, 3, 1, 5, 4)
- (4, 3, 1, 7, 4)
- (4, 8, 1, 5, 4)
- (4, 8, 2, 9, 4)
- (4, 8, 5, 1, 4)
- (4, 0, 6, 5, 4)
- (4, 0, 6, 7, 4)
- (8, 5, 6, 7, 8)
- (8, 5, 1, 9, 8)
- (8, 5, 6, 4, 8)
- (8, 1, 5, 6, 8)
- (8, 1, 7, 2, 8)
- (8, 1, 4, 9, 8)
- (8, 2, 9, 1, 8)
- (6, 5, 1, 7, 6)
- (6, 5, 8, 4, 6)
- (6, 5, 4, 0, 6)
- (6, 4, 8, 1, 6)
- (6, 4, 9, 2, 6)
- (6, 7, 2, 9, 6)
- (2, 9, 4, 0, 2)
- (2, 9, 1, 7, 2)
- (2, 9, 4, 8, 2)
- (2, 8, 5, 1, 2)
- (2, 8, 4, 0, 2)
- (2, 7, 1, 5, 2)
- (0, 4, 8, 1, 0)
- (0, 4, 9, 2, 0)
- (0, 6, 5, 1, 0)
- (0, 6, 7, 2, 0)
- (0, 7, 1, 9, 0)
- (7, 9, 1, 5, 7)
- (7, 9, 2, 8, 7)
- (7, 9, 4, 0, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5, 8), 4, 9>
- <1, (5, 6), 7, 1>
- <1, (9, 2), 7, 1>
- <1, (9, 7), 6, 1>
- <1, (3, 4), 9, 1>
- <4, (9, 2), 7, 4>
- <4, (9, 1), 8, 4>
- <4, (3, 1), 5, 4>
- <4, (8, 1), 5, 4>
- <4, (0, 6), 5, 4>
- <8, (5, 6), 7, 8>
- <8, (1, 7), 2, 8>
- <8, (1, 4), 9, 8>
- <6, (5, 4), 0, 6>
- <6, (7, 2), 9, 6>
- <2, (9, 4), 0, 2>
- <2, (8, 5), 1, 2>
- <2, (7, 1), 5, 2>
- <0, (4, 8), 1, 0>
- <7, (9, 2), 8, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [18].
