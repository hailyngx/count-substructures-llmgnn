Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 4, 3>
2. Cycle <9, 4, 7, 1>
3. Cycle <4, 7, 1, 3>
4. Cycle <7, 1, 6, 3>
5. Cycle <1, 3, 6, 2>
6. Cycle <3, 6, 0, 5>
7. Cycle <6, 2, 8, 4>
8. Cycle <2, 8, 4, 9>
9. Cycle <8, 4, 9, 5>
10. Cycle <0, 6, 2, 7>
11. Cycle <6, 1, 9, 5>
12. Cycle <3, 1, 7, 4>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <5, 9, 4, 3> has chord (9, 4)
- Cycle <9, 4, 7, 1> has chord (4, 1)
- Cycle <4, 7, 1, 3> has chord (7, 3)
- Cycle <7, 1, 6, 3> has chord (1, 6)
- Cycle <1, 3, 6, 2> has chord (3, 6)
- Cycle <3, 6, 0, 5> has chord (6, 0)
- Cycle <6, 2, 8, 4> has chord (2, 8)
- Cycle <2, 8, 4, 9> has chord (8, 4)
- Cycle <8, 4, 9, 5> has chord (4, 9)
- Cycle <0, 6, 2, 7> has chord (6, 2)
- Cycle <6, 1, 9, 5> has chord (1, 9)
- Cycle <3, 1, 7, 4> has chord (1, 7)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, (9, 4), 3>
- <9, (4, 1), 7>
- <4, (7, 3), 1>
- <7, (1, 6), 3>
- <1, (3, 6), 2>
- <3, (6, 0), 5>
- <6, (2, 8), 4>
- <2, (8, 4), 9>
- <8, (4, 9), 5>
- <0, (6, 2), 7>
- <6, (1, 9), 5>
- <3, (1, 7), 4>
