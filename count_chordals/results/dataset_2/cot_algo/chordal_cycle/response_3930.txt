Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 4, 5, 6> Chord: (0, 5)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 6, 2, 0> Chord: (5, 2)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 6, 1, 0> Chord: (5, 1)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, 6, 1, 8> Chord: (6, 8)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 7, 3, 1> Chord: (5, 3)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, 7, 9, 3> Chord: (5, 9)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6, 1, 8, 3> Chord: (1, 3)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, 1, 9, 3> Chord: (6, 3)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <7, 5, 6, 1> Chord: (7, 6)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <9, 7, 5, 6> Chord: (7, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        As there are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, the number of chordless cycles is [47].
