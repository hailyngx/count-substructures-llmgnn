Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<0, 7, 3, 14> has one chord (0, 14)
<1, 6, 9, 4> has one chord (6, 9)
<1, 7, 0, 14> has one chord (7, 14)
<1, 6, 9, 4> has one chord (6, 9)
<1, 6, 10, 8> has one chord (6, 8)
<1, 6, 14, 3> has one chord (6, 14)
<2, 9, 6, 14> has one chord (9, 14)
<3, 7, 0, 14> has one chord (7, 14)
<4, 7, 0, 14> has one chord (7, 14)
<5, 0, 14, 6> has one chord (0, 6)
<5, 12, 2, 9> has one chord (2, 9)
<6, 9, 4, 7> has one chord (9, 4)
<8, 10, 6, 1> has one chord (10, 1)
<11, 7, 0, 14> has one chord (7, 14)
<12, 5, 0, 14> has one chord (5, 0)
<13, 0, 5, 12> has one chord (0, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
