Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, we can identify the chordal 4-cycles:
1. Chordal cycle <0, 6, 2, 22> with chord (6, 22)
2. Chordal cycle <0, 23, 7, 15> with chord (7, 23)
3. Chordal cycle <0, 14, 12, 11> with chord (12, 11)
4. Chordal cycle <2, 3, 25, 4> with chord (3, 25)
5. Chordal cycle <2, 16, 5, 20> with chord (5, 16)
6. Chordal cycle <4, 26, 27, 6> with chord (26, 27)
7. Chordal cycle <5, 16, 15, 23> with chord (15, 16)
8. Chordal cycle <5, 20, 18, 9> with chord (18, 20)
9. Chordal cycle <5, 20, 24, 22> with chord (20, 24)
10. Chordal cycle <5, 20, 21, 8> with chord (20, 21)

Step 3:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
