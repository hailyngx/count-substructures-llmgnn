Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-1-5
- Cycle 2: 5-7-9-4-5
- Cycle 3: 5-1-4-7-5
- Cycle 4: 9-4-7-5-9
- Cycle 5: 9-7-5-1-9
- Cycle 6: 4-9-7-0-4
- Cycle 7: 4-7-3-0-4
- Cycle 8: 4-1-5-7-4
- Cycle 9: 7-5-9-0-7
- Cycle 10: 7-4-9-5-7
- Cycle 11: 7-0-3-1-7
- Cycle 12: 1-5-7-0-1
- Cycle 13: 3-7-9-0-3
- Cycle 14: 8-4-9-2-8
- Cycle 15: 8-2-6-4-8
- Cycle 16: 8-0-3-7-8
- Cycle 17: 6-2-8-0-6
- Cycle 18: 2-9-4-1-2

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5, 7), 4>
- <2, (9, 3), 4>
- <3, (1, 4), 7>
- <5, (9, 7), 4>
- <6, (5, 9), 7>
- <8, (4, 1), 7>
- <10, (9, 4), 7>
- <12, (5, 7), 1>
- <14, (4, 9), 2>

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [9].
