Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 4) (16, 10) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 5) (17, 4) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (5, 17) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 4) (13, 11) (13, 17) (13, 5) (13, 15) (3, 7) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 1) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 15) (10, 1) (10, 9) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 7) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 18) (0, 12) (1, 19) (1, 10) (1, 6) (6, 15) (6, 1) (6, 4) (18, 0) (12, 8) (12, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (4, 16) (4, 17) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 0, 15) with edges (11, 16), (16, 0), (0, 15), (15, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 13, 5, 17) with edges (11, 13), (13, 5), (5, 17), (17, 11)
- Cycle 3: (2, 19, 1, 6) with edges (2, 19), (19, 1), (1, 6), (6, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 19, 5, 17) with edges (2, 19), (19, 5), (5, 17), (17, 2)
- Cycle 5: (8, 9, 10, 2) with edges (8, 9), (9, 10), (10, 2), (2, 8)
- Cycle 6: (8, 9, 7, 3) with edges (8, 9), (9, 7), (7, 3), (3, 8)
- Cycle 7: (9, 10, 1, 6) with edges (9, 10), (10, 1), (1, 6), (6, 9)
- Cycle 8: (0, 18, 15, 6) with edges (0, 18), (18, 15), (15, 6), (6, 0)
- Cycle 9: (12, 0, 15, 6) with edges (12, 0), (0, 15), (15, 6), (6, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has chord (13, 17).
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has no chord.
- Cycle 8 has no chord.
- Cycle 9 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 7 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<11, 16, 0, 15>
<11, 13, 5, 17>
