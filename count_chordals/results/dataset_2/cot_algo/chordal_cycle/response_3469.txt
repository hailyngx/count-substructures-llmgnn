Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 8) (15, 5) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 17) (1, 2) (10, 4) (10, 16) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (18, 14) (18, 0) (7, 15) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 17) (12, 16) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 17) (8, 15) (8, 14) (17, 1) (17, 7) (17, 4) (5, 15) (5, 2) (19, 9) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 13) (0, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 0) (16, 14) (14, 18) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 3-15-7-6-3
- Cycle 2: 3-6-9-2-3
- Cycle 3: 3-11-4-17-3
- Cycle 4: 15-7-14-18-15
- Cycle 5: 6-7-14-18-6
- Cycle 6: 9-2-1-17-9
- Cycle 7: 2-5-15-7-2
- Cycle 8: 2-1-17-4-2
- Cycle 9: 18-14-7-17-18
- Cycle 10: 7-17-4-11-7
- Cycle 11: 14-8-15-5-14
- Cycle 12: 16-0-18-14-16

Step 2:
Out of the above cycles, the only chordal 4-cycle is: 
<3, (15, 7), 6>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 11, so the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
