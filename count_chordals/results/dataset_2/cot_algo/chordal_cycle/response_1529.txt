Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 12) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 13) (5, 10) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 12) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 13) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 12) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 13) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 1, 13, 5, 10, 8, 7, 2, 12, 13, 1, 9, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 1, 13, 5, 14, 4, 12, 2, 7, 13, 0, 9, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 11, 3, 10, 5, 14, 4, 12, 2, 0, 13, 7, 8, 3, 11, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 4, 12, 2, 0, 13, 7, 8, 3, 11, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 1, 13, 5, 10, 8, 7, 2, 12, 13, 1, 9, 6) has 1 chord: (9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 1, 13, 5, 14, 4, 12, 2, 7, 13, 0, 9, 6) has 1 chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 3: (6, 11, 3, 10, 5, 14, 4, 12, 2, 0, 13, 7, 8, 3, 11, 6) has 1 chord: (11, 3)
- Cycle 4: (6, 4, 12, 2, 0, 13, 7, 8, 3, 11, 6) has 1 chord: (4, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. We found 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <6, 9, 1, (13, 5), 10, 8, 7, 2, 12>
- <6, 9, 1, (13, 5), 14, 4, 12, 2, 7>
- <6, 11, 3, (10, 5), 14, 4, 12, 2, 0>
- <6, 4, 12, 2, 0, 13, 7, 8, 3>
