Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <1, 8, 11, 7, 1> with chords (1, 11)
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 4, 3, 1> with chords (5, 3)
- Cycle 3: <2, 5, 1, 7, 2> with chords (5, 7)
- Cycle 4: <2, 5, 3, 1, 2> with chords (5, 1)
- Cycle 5: <2, 13, 7, 11, 2> with chords (13, 11)
- Cycle 6: <4, 5, 1, 3, 4> with chords (5, 3)
- Cycle 7: <4, 10, 6, 2, 4> with chords (10, 6)

Step 2:
- From the cycles listed above, we can see that Cycle 1, Cycle 2, and Cycle 6 have exactly one chord.

Step 3:
- Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, 8, 11, 7>
<1, 5, 4, 3>
<4, 10, 6, 2>
