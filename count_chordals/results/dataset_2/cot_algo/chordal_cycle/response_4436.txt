Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (1, 8, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 0, 5, 8, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 7, 2, 5, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 5, 8, 7, 2)
- Cycle 5: (3, 4, 8, 7, 3)
- Cycle 6: (4, 3, 5, 8, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 1, 0, 5, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 1, 0, 2, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 8, 5, 2, 7)
- Cycle 10: (9, 1, 0, 5, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 0, 2, 5, 9)
- Cycle 12: (9, 3, 4, 8, 9)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes) are:
- Cycle 1: (1, 8, 4, 3, 1)  <(1, 8)>
- Cycle 2: (1, 0, 5, 8, 1)  <(1, 5)>
- Cycle 3: (1, 7, 2, 5, 1)  <(1, 2)>
- Cycle 4: (2, 5, 8, 7, 2)  <(2, 8)>
- Cycle 5: (3, 4, 8, 7, 3)  <(3, 8)>
- Cycle 6: (4, 3, 5, 8, 4)  <(4, 5)>
- Cycle 7: (4, 1, 0, 5, 4)  <(4, 0)>
- Cycle 8: (7, 1, 0, 2, 7)  <(7, 0)>
- Cycle 9: (7, 8, 5, 2, 7)  <(7, 5)>
- Cycle 10: (9, 1, 0, 5, 9)  <(9, 0)>
- Cycle 11: (9, 0, 2, 5, 9)  <(9, 2)>
- Cycle 12: (9, 3, 4, 8, 9)  <(9, 4)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
