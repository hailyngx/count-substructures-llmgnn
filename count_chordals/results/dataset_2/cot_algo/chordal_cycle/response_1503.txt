Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 11) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 4) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 0) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 12) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-14-4-1
- Cycle 2: 0-9-11-3-0
- Cycle 3: 2-11-3-14-2
- Cycle 4: 4-1-7-3-4
- Cycle 5: 5-6-2-11-5
- Cycle 6: 6-8-0-11-6
- Cycle 7: 10-8-7-1-10
- Cycle 8: 12-3-14-4-12
- Cycle 9: 13-11-9-0-13
- Cycle 10: 14-1-4-2-14

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (11, 14)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (5, 2)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (8, 6)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (10, 1)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (3, 4)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (11, 9)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (1, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found.

Putting the final number inside brackets: [9]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, (9, 3), 11>
<1, (11, 14), 3>
<3, (1, 3), 4>
<5, (5, 2), 6>
<6, (8, 6), 0>
<10, (10, 1), 8>
<12, (3, 4), 14>
<13, (11, 9), 0>
<14, (1, 4), 2>
