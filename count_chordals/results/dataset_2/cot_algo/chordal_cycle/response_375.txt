Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 17) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 15) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 5) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 13) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 15) (0, 18) (0, 13) (14, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (3, 11) (3, 10) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 16) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 18) (13, 0) (13, 9) (13, 17) (17, 11) (17, 16) (17, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (10, 18) (10, 3) (10, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (6, 8) (6, 4) (19, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <11, 18, 2, 8, 11>
- Cycle 2: <11, 17, 13, 9, 11>
- Cycle 3: <16, 15, 7, 12, 16>
- Cycle 4: <7, 8, 2, 18, 7>
- Cycle 5: <18, 13, 9, 15, 18>
- Cycle 6: <2, 18, 11, 7, 2>
- Cycle 7: <8, 6, 4, 10, 8>
- Cycle 8: <5, 4, 6, 8, 5>

Step 2: Identify the chordal 4-cycles:
- Cycle 1: <11, 18, 2, 8, 11> has exactly one chord (18, 8)
- Cycle 2: <11, 17, 13, 9, 11> has exactly one chord (17, 9)
- Cycle 3: <16, 15, 7, 12, 16> has exactly one chord (15, 7)
- Cycle 4: <7, 8, 2, 18, 7> has exactly one chord (8, 18)
- Cycle 5: <18, 13, 9, 15, 18> has exactly one chord (13, 15)
- Cycle 6: <2, 18, 11, 7, 2> has exactly one chord (18, 11)
- Cycle 7: <8, 6, 4, 10, 8> has exactly one chord (6, 10)
- Cycle 8: <5, 4, 6, 8, 5> has exactly one chord (4, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<11, 18, 2, 8, 11>
<11, 17, 13, 9, 11>
<16, 15, 7, 12, 16>
<7, 8, 2, 18, 7>
<18, 13, 9, 15, 18>
<2, 18, 11, 7, 2>
<8, 6, 4, 10, 8>
<5, 4, 6, 8, 5>
