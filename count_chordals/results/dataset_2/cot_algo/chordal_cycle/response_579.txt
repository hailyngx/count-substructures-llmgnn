Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 9) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 15) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 8) (12, 16) (12, 0) (0, 12) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 15) (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 15) (13, 18) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 4) (18, 11) (18, 13) (18, 19) (19, 10) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 4) (9, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 6) (2, 15) (4, 16) (4, 19) (4, 5) (15, 17) (15, 14) (15, 13) (15, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows: 

- Cycle 1: 1 - 3 - 11 - 19 - 10 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 10 - 14 - 15 - 17 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 8 - 17 - 15 - 14 - 10 - 1
- Cycle 4: 3 - 9 - 1 - 10 - 14 - 15 - 3
- Cycle 5: 3 - 9 - 1 - 8 - 7 - 16 - 3
- Cycle 6: 3 - 11 - 18 - 19 - 10 - 1 - 3
- Cycle 7: 7 - 16 - 13 - 17 - 15 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 8: 12 - 16 - 13 - 17 - 8 - 7 - 12
- Cycle 9: 0 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 17 - 13 - 0
- Cycle 10: 14 - 15 - 17 - 13 - 18 - 11 - 14
- Cycle 11: 15 - 2 - 6 - 0 - 12 - 16 - 15

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, (11, 19)>
- <1, 10, (14, 15)>
- <1, 8, (17, 15)>
- <3, 9, (1, 10)>
- <3, 11, (18, 19)>
- <7, 16, (13, 17)>
- <12, 16, (13, 17)>
- <0, 6, (7, 8)>
- <14, 15, (17, 13)>
- <15, 2, (6, 0)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [0] in this graph.
