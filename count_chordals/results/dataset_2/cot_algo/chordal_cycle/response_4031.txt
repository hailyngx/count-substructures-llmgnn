Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 10) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 11) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 0) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 12) (2, 11) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 13, 12, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 14, 1, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 14, 11, 0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 11, 1, 0, 2)
- Cycle 5: (3, 10, 13, 12, 3)
- Cycle 6: (4, 10, 13, 12, 4)
- Cycle 7: (6, 10, 13, 12, 6)
- Cycle 8: (7, 10, 13, 12, 7)
- Cycle 9: (8, 0, 5, 14, 8)
- Cycle 10: (9, 0, 5, 14, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (13, 12)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 14)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (14, 11)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (1, 0)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (10, 13)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (10, 13)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (10, 13)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (10, 13)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (5, 14)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (5, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
