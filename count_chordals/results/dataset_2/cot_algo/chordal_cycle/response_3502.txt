Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 13) (17, 22) (17, 26) (3, 14) (25, 21) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 2) (21, 25) (21, 18) (0, 7) (0, 27) (0, 10) (0, 23) (27, 7) (27, 0) (27, 12) (27, 6) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 5) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 21) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 1) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 16) (6, 27) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 8) (29, 17) (29, 15) (29, 4) (29, 10) (26, 17) (26, 11) (26, 8) (26, 24) (28, 6) (28, 9) (28, 1) (24, 26) (24, 11) (24, 4) (24, 23) (11, 26) (11, 24) (11, 4) (16, 5) (16, 13) (8, 6) (8, 26) (9, 28) (9, 20) (13, 17) (13, 16) (4, 12) (4, 29) (4, 24) (4, 11) (1, 14) (1, 18) (1, 28) (1, 15) (15, 14) (15, 29) (15, 1) (15, 22) (10, 0) (10, 29) (23, 0) (23, 18) (23, 24) (20, 9) (20, 22) (22, 17) (22, 15) (22, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 14, 15, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 14, 17, 13, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 14, 17, 22, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 14, 3, 27, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 15, 22, 17, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 15, 29, 17, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 28, 18, 21, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 28, 18, 23, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 28, 6, 27, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 15, 22, 20, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 28, 6, 8, 1)

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (14, 15), 17, 13, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (14, 17), 22, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (17, 22), 15, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (3, 27), 14, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (15, 29), 17, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (18, 21), 28, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, (18, 23), 28, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, (6, 27), 28, 1>

Step 3:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, hence the final count is [8].
