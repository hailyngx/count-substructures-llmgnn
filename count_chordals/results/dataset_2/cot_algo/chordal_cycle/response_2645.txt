Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with all edges existing:
- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 6, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 9, 6, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 9, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 1, 2, 8, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 9, 2, 8, 7)
- Cycle 6: (6, 9, 3, 2, 6)
- Cycle 7: (5, 6, 0, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 0, 2, 3, 5)
- Cycle 9: (2, 8, 1, 4, 2)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (5, 6), 4>
- <2, (7, 9), 8>
- <3, (6, 9), 4>
- <4, (4, 2), 8>
- <5, (7, 8), 9>
- <6, (2, 3), 9>
- <7, (0, 5), 6>
- <8, (0, 3), 5>
- <9, (1, 8), 4>

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the total count is [9].
