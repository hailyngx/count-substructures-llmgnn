Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 14) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 11) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (11, 9) (10, 3) (10, 13) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-13-1 (Chords: None)
- Cycle 2: 1-8-13-1 (Chords: None)
- Cycle 3: 1-4-6-5-1 (Chords: None)
- Cycle 4: 1-4-2-3-1 (Chords: None)
- Cycle 5: 1-4-12-13-1 (Chords: None)
- Cycle 6: 1-4-12-5-1 (Chords: None)
- Cycle 7: 1-4-2-12-1 (Chords: None)
- Cycle 8: 1-13-14-5-1 (Chords: None)
- Cycle 9: 1-13-10-3-1 (Chords: None)
- Cycle 10: 1-13-12-5-1 (Chords: None)
- Cycle 11: 1-12-5-14-1 (Chords: None)
- Cycle 12: 1-12-5-0-1 (Chords: None)
- Cycle 13: 1-12-4-2-1 (Chords: None)
- Cycle 14: 1-12-13-8-1 (Chords: None)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- <1, 3, 13, 1> has 1 chord: (1, 3)
- <1, 8, 13, 1> has 1 chord: (1, 8)
- <1, 4, 6, 5, 1> has 2 chords: (4, 6)
- <1, 4, 2, 3, 1> has 2 chords: (4, 2)
- <1, 4, 12, 13, 1> has 2 chords: (4, 12)
- <1, 4, 12, 5, 1> has 2 chords: (4, 12)
- <1, 4, 2, 12, 1> has 2 chords: (4, 2)
- <1, 13, 14, 5, 1> has 2 chords: (14, 5)
- <1, 13, 10, 3, 1> has 1 chord: (1, 13)
- <1, 13, 12, 5, 1> has 1 chord: (1, 13)
- <1, 12, 5, 14, 1> has 1 chord: (1, 12)
- <1, 12, 5, 0, 1> has 1 chord: (1, 12)
- <1, 12, 4, 2, 1> has 1 chord: (1, 12)
- <1, 12, 13, 8, 1> has 1 chord: (1, 12)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: 
- There are 10 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [10].
