Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Some cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-6-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-9-3-5-1
- Cycle 3: 7-1-4-6-7
- Cycle 4: 7-1-9-3-7
- Cycle 5: 5-2-4-6-5
- Cycle 6: 5-3-9-1-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

After checking, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <1, (4, 6), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Counting the number of chordless cycles found is [5].
