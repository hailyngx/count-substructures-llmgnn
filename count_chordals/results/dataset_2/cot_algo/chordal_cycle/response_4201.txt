Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 21) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 21) (2, 29) (2, 16) (2, 28) (2, 0) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 19) (29, 26) (29, 0) (1, 3) (1, 20) (1, 23) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 18) (23, 22) (23, 1) (23, 14) (12, 27) (12, 10) (12, 14) (27, 12) (27, 28) (27, 5) (10, 12) (10, 17) (10, 15) (17, 10) (17, 9) (17, 26) (0, 2) (0, 29) (20, 29) (20, 1) (9, 22) (9, 17) (7, 6) (7, 15) (5, 27) (5, 25) (19, 29) (19, 11) (19, 4) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 26) (15, 24) (8, 3) (8, 25) (8, 11) (18, 3) (18, 14) (26, 29) (26, 17) (26, 15) (26, 4) (16, 2) (16, 21) (16, 6) (21, 13) (21, 22) (21, 16) (11, 19) (11, 8) (24, 15) (24, 14) (6, 22) (6, 7) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 4) (14, 23) (14, 12) (14, 18) (14, 24) (14, 6) (4, 19) (4, 26) (4, 6) (25, 5) (25, 8) (28, 2) (28, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 22 - 13 - 22 - 21 - 22
- Cycle 2: 2 - 29 - 2 - 16 - 2
- Cycle 3: 1 - 3 - 1 - 20 - 1
- Cycle 4: 3 - 23 - 22 - 13 - 3
- Cycle 5: 12 - 27 - 12 - 14 - 12
- Cycle 6: 10 - 17 - 10 - 15 - 10
- Cycle 7: 0 - 2 - 29 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 8: 9 - 22 - 21 - 16 - 6 - 22 - 9
- Cycle 9: 7 - 6 - 22 - 21 - 16 - 6 - 14 - 7
- Cycle 10: 5 - 27 - 12 - 14 - 6 - 4 - 19 - 5
- Cycle 11: 25 - 5 - 27 - 28 - 2 - 0 - 29 - 26 - 4 - 6 - 25

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 is chordal with a chord (22, 21).
- Cycle 2 is chordless.
- Cycle 3 is chordless.
- Cycle 4 is chordless.
- Cycle 5 is chordless.
- Cycle 6 is chordless.
- Cycle 7 is chordless.
- Cycle 8 is chordal with a chord (21, 16).
- Cycle 9 is chordal with a chord (21, 16).
- Cycle 10 is chordal with a chord (12, 14).
- Cycle 11 is chordal with a chord (27, 28).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 4 chordless cycles found.

Final count: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<2, (22, 21), 16)>
<3, (12, 14), 6)>
<4, (21, 16), 6)>
<5, (27, 28), 2)>
