Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (5, 6) (5, 18) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 15) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 18) (19, 8) (19, 15) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 12) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 14) (12, 19) (12, 14) (15, 8) (15, 19) (15, 13) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 16) (14, 12) (1, 2) (1, 19) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 13) (17, 2) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 15) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 10, 7, 4, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 10, 11, 7, 4, 3, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 10, 7, 11, 10, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 10, 13, 9, 13, 15, 8, 2, 1, 19, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 10, 13, 15, 8, 6, 5, 18, 3, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 10, 13, 15, 8, 6, 5, 18, 13, 9, 13, 15, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 3, 4, 11, 10, 13, 15, 8, 19, 12, 14, 0>

- Cycle 9: <1, 2, 8, 6, 5, 18, 3, 0, 16, 14, 12, 19, 1>
- Cycle 10: <2, 8, 6, 5, 18, 3, 4, 11, 10, 13, 9, 13, 15, 0, 16, 14, 12, 19, 2>
- Cycle 11: <2, 8, 6, 5, 18, 3, 4, 11, 10, 13, 15, 8, 19, 12, 14, 16, 0, 10, 0, 16, 14, 12, 19, 2>
- Cycle 12: <3, 4, 11, 10, 13, 15, 8, 6, 5, 18, 3>
- Cycle 13: <5, 6, 8, 15, 13, 10, 14, 12, 16, 0, 3, 18, 5>
- Cycle 14: <13, 9, 10, 11, 4, 3, 18, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, 10, 7, 4, 3, 0> (Chord: 7-3)
- Cycle 2: <0, 10, 11, 7, 4, 3, 0> (Chord: 11-3)
- Cycle 3: <0, 10, 7, 11, 10, 0> (Chord: 7-11)
- Cycle 4: <0, 10, 13, 9, 13, 15, 8, 2, 1, 19, 0> (Chord: 2-15)
- Cycle 5: <0, 10, 13, 15, 8, 6, 5, 18, 3, 0> (Chord: 5-15)
- Cycle 6: <0, 10, 13, 15, 8, 6, 5, 18, 13, 9, 13, 15, 0> (Chord: 5-13)
- Cycle 7: <0, 3, 4, 11, 10, 13, 15, 8, 19, 12, 14, 0> (Chord: 4-15)
- Cycle 8: <0, 3, 4, 11, 10, 13, 15, 8, 19, 14, 16, 0> (Chord: 4-13)
- Cycle 9: <1, 2, 8, 6, 5, 18, 3, 0, 16, 14, 12, 19, 1> (Chord: 6-16)
- Cycle 10: <2, 8, 6, 5, 18, 3, 4, 11, 10, 13, 9, 13, 15, 0, 16, 14, 12, 19, 2> (Chord: 4-15)
- Cycle 11: <2, 8, 6, 5, 18, 3, 4, 11, 10, 13, 15, 8, 19, 12, 14, 16, 0, 10, 0, 16, 14, 12, 19, 2> (Chord: 4-15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found
There are a total of [11] chordal 4-cycles found.
