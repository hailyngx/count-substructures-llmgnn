Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 1) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 2) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 3) (0, 6) (0, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-9-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-9-8-13-4-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-9-7-14-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-7-9-8-13-4-1
- Cycle 5: 1-7-9-6-14-2-1
- Cycle 6: 1-12-7-9-6-1
- Cycle 7: 1-12-7-9-8-13-4-1
- Cycle 8: 1-2-14-6-9-1
- Cycle 9: 1-2-14-7-9-1
- Cycle 10: 1-2-14-13-8-9-1
- Cycle 11: 2-14-6-9-5-2
- Cycle 12: 4-13-8-9-5-4
- Cycle 13: 4-13-8-9-7-6-4
- Cycle 14: 1-6-7-9-8-13-1

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges) are:
- Cycle 3: Chord (9, 14)
- Cycle 4: Chord (9, 13)
- Cycle 5: Chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 6: Chord (7, 6)
- Cycle 7: Chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 8: Chord (14, 9)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is therefore [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<3, (9, 14)>
<4, (9, 13)>
<5, (9, 6)>
<6, (7, 6)>
<7, (7, 8)>
<8, (14, 9)>
