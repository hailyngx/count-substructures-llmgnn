Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 7) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 4) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 13) (1, 6) (1, 13) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 14) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-10-6-5
- Cycle 2: 6-10-11-14-6
- Cycle 3: 6-10-12-2-6
- Cycle 4: 6-3-2-8-6
- Cycle 5: 6-3-12-10-6
- Cycle 6: 10-12-2-8-10
- Cycle 7: 10-6-3-12-10
- Cycle 8: 10-9-5-8-10
- Cycle 9: 11-10-12-2-11
- Cycle 10: 11-10-6-3-11
- Cycle 11: 11-14-6-10-11
- Cycle 12: 2-12-10-6-2
- Cycle 13: 2-8-5-9-2
- Cycle 14: 2-8-11-14-2
- Cycle 15: 2-3-6-0-2
- Cycle 16: 8-11-14-4-8
- Cycle 17: 8-11-10-6-8
- Cycle 18: 8-2-3-6-8
- Cycle 19: 8-0-6-14-8
- Cycle 20: 12-10-6-0-12
- Cycle 21: 12-10-9-5-12
- Cycle 22: 12-2-3-13-12
- Cycle 23: 12-8-5-9-12
- Cycle 24: 12-8-11-10-12
- Cycle 25: 4-9-10-6-4
- Cycle 26: 4-9-5-8-4
- Cycle 27: 4-14-11-10-4
- Cycle 28: 3-6-10-12-3
- Cycle 29: 3-6-0-7-3
- Cycle 30: 3-2-12-10-3
- Cycle 31: 3-2-8-5-3
- Cycle 32: 3-12-10-6-3
- Cycle 33: 13-11-10-6-13
- Cycle 34: 13-11-8-2-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (6, 10), 13>
- <2, (10, 12), 6>
- <3, (2, 12), 6>
- <4, (9, 10), 6>
- <5, (8, 9), 6>
- <7, (2, 8), 13>
- <11, (6, 10), 8>
- <14, (4, 10), 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [7].
