This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 21) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 21) (1, 26) (1, 25) (21, 15) (21, 1) (21, 14) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 20) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (2, 6) (2, 28) (12, 7) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 24) (27, 6) (28, 3) (28, 2) (28, 10) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 8) (14, 3) (14, 21) (14, 0) (14, 26) (14, 23) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 18) (26, 20) (18, 3) (18, 26) (25, 1) (25, 9) (25, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 9) (17, 3) (17, 13) (17, 22) (8, 0) (8, 9) (19, 22) (19, 6) (22, 17) (22, 19) (9, 25) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 23) (10, 15) (10, 28) (10, 6) (11, 15) (24, 27) (24, 5) (5, 25) (5, 24) (5, 23) (23, 14) (23, 9) (23, 5) (23, 16) (20, 4) (20, 26) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 23) (6, 2) (6, 27) (6, 19) (6, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Identify all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 21, 1) with edges (3, 15), (15, 21), (21, 1), (1, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 14, 0, 7) with edges (3, 14), (14, 0), (0, 7), (7, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 18, 26, 1) with edges (3, 18), (18, 26), (26, 1), (1, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 17, 13, 4) with edges (3, 17), (17, 13), (13, 4), (4, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 28, 2, 6) with edges (3, 28), (28, 2), (2, 6), (6, 3)
- Cycle 6: (15, 10, 6, 2) with edges (15, 10), (10, 6), (6, 2), (2, 15)
- Cycle 7: (14, 26, 20, 4) with edges (14, 26), (26, 20), (20, 4), (4, 14)
- Cycle 8: (14, 0, 8, 9) with edges (14, 0), (0, 8), (8, 9), (9, 14)
- Cycle 9: (14, 26, 18, 3) with edges (14, 26), (26, 18), (18, 3), (3, 14)
- Cycle 10: (14, 23, 5, 25) with edges (14, 23), (23, 5), (5, 25), (25, 14)
- Cycle 11: (13, 17, 22, 19) with edges (13, 17), (17, 22), (22, 19), (19, 13)
- Cycle 12: (16, 23, 5, 24) with edges (16, 23), (23, 5), (5, 24), (24, 16)

Step 2:
Identify chordal 4-cycles by checking for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 21), 15, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (3, 28), 6, 10)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (3, 17), 13, 23)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <14, (0, 7), 9, 26)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <16, (13, 17), 23, 5)>

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (3, 21), 15, 6)>
<2, (3, 28), 6, 10)>
<4, (3, 17), 13, 23)>
<14, (0, 7), 9, 26)>
<16, (13, 17), 23, 5)>
