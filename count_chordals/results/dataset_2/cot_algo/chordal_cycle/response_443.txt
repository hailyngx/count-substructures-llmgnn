Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Possible cycles of length 4 with all edges existing:
- (1, 3, 5, 7, 1)
- (1, 6, 2, 8, 1)
- (1, 9, 4, 7, 1)
- (1, 0, 2, 5, 1)
- (3, 5, 7, 8, 3)
- (5, 7, 9, 2, 5)
- (6, 2, 8, 0, 6)
- (2, 8, 6, 1, 2)
- (8, 1, 3, 6, 8)
- (0, 2, 6, 8, 0)
- (9, 4, 7, 5, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (3, 5), 7>
- <1, (6, 2), 8>
- <1, (4, 7), 9>
- <1, (0, 2), 5>
- <5, (7, 9), 2>
- <6, (8, 2), 0>
- <8, (1, 3), 6>
- <9, (4, 7), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]
