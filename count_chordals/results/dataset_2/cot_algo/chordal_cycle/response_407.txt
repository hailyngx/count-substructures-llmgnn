Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 6 - 1 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 1 - 2 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 3: 6 - 1 - 7 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 4: 6 - 1 - 3 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 5: 6 - 1 - 3 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 6: 9 - 4 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 7: 9 - 8 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 8: 9 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 9
- Cycle 9: 1 - 3 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 10: 1 - 0 - 5 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 11: 1 - 0 - 5 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 12: 1 - 7 - 5 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 13: 3 - 7 - 5 - 2 - 3
- Cycle 14: 4 - 2 - 5 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 15: 4 - 2 - 1 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 16: 7 - 3 - 1 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 17: 7 - 3 - 6 - 9 - 7
- Cycle 18: 8 - 4 - 2 - 5 - 8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 6 has one chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 13 has one chord: (3, 7)
- Cycle 14 has one chord: (2, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, which should be represented as [4]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<6, (9, 6), 9)>
<8, (4, 8), 2)>
<13, (3, 7), 2)>
<14, (2, 5), 8)>
