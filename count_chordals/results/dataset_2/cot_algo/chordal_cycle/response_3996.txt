Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 3-9-7-6-3
- Cycle 2: 4-6-8-1-4
- Cycle 3: 1-2-5-6-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-9-7-1

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (7, 3)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (8, 4)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (2, 5)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (3, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <1, 2, 5, 6, (5, 2)>
So, the final answer is [0].
