Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 5) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 8) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 11) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 4) (1, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle: 0-8-1-4-0
- Cycle: 0-4-1-13-0
- Cycle: 0-7-2-12-0
- Cycle: 1-8-12-2-1
- Cycle: 1-13-12-2-1
- Cycle: 2-12-8-10-2
- Cycle: 2-12-11-6-2
- Cycle: 2-14-10-5-2
- Cycle: 3-9-11-6-3
- Cycle: 3-11-12-2-3
- Cycle: 4-9-11-6-4
- Cycle: 5-10-14-2-5
- Cycle: 5-7-13-1-5
- Cycle: 6-11-10-14-6
- Cycle: 7-9-4-0-7
- Cycle: 8-10-11-6-8
- Cycle: 8-0-7-2-8
- Cycle: 9-11-12-13-9
- Cycle: 10-14-5-7-10
- Cycle: 11-12-13-6-11
- Cycle: 12-8-0-7-12
- Cycle: 13-12-2-14-13
- Cycle: 14-10-11-6-14

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
- <0, (1,4), 8, 0>
- <0, (1,13), 12, 0>
- <0, 7, (2,12), 0>
- <1, (8,12), 2, 1>
- <1, (12,13), 2, 1>
- <2, 12, (8,10), 2>
- <2, 6, (11,12), 2>
- <2, 14, (5,10), 2>
- <3, (9,11), 6, 3>
- <3, 11, (2,12), 3>
- <4, 9, (6,11), 4>
- <5, 10, (2,14), 5>
- <5, 7, (1,13), 5>
- <6, 11, (10,14), 6>
- <7, 0, (4,9), 7>
- <8, 10, (11,6), 8>
- <0, 7, (12,13), 9>
- <10, 14, (11,6), 10>
- <11, 12, (13,6), 11>
- <7, 12, (0,8), 12>
- <12, 2, (14,13), 13>
- <10, 11, (6,14), 14>

Step 3:
There are 23 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [23].
