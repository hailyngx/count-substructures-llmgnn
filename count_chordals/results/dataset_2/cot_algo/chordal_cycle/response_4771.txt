Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 17) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 0) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 15) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (16, 4) (16, 1) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) (10, 6) (18, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 16) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 19) (15, 17) (19, 9) (19, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are multiple cycles in the graph with length 4 or more, including (5, 1, 7, 4), (5, 1, 16, 4), (5, 7, 4, 13), (9, 17, 13, 4), (7, 4, 13, 8), (7, 4, 16, 1), (9, 13, 8, 2), (17, 13, 8, 2), (5, 1, 16, 1), (4, 7, 14, 12), and many more.

Step 2:
- The cycle (5, 1, 7, 4) has exactly one chord (5, 4), forming a chordal 4-cycle <5, 4, 1, 7>.
- The cycle (7, 4, 13, 8) also has exactly one chord (7, 8), forming a chordal 4-cycle <7, 8, 13, 4>.

Step 3:
- There are two unique chordal 4-cycles identified, so the final count is [2].
