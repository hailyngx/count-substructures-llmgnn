Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 14) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 17) (8, 7) (2, 18) (2, 9) (18, 4) (18, 2) (18, 17) (0, 5) (14, 16) (14, 9) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 19) (12, 16) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 19) (6, 1) (6, 19) (6, 13) (7, 11) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 3) (19, 3) (19, 1) (19, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 15) (5, 10) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 13) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (10, 1) (10, 5) (17, 11) (17, 8) (17, 18) (13, 6) (13, 15) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
1. <11, 16, 7, 3>
2. <11, 16, 7, 8>
3. <11, 16, 14, 9>
4. <4, 8, 17, 18>
5. <4, 1, 6, 19>
6. <4, 1, 10, 5>
7. <4, 15, 5, 0>
8. <8, 17, 18, 4>
9. <2, 18, 17, 8>
10. <2, 18, 4, 1>
11. <2, 9, 14, 16>
12. <18, 17, 11, 16>
13. <0, 5, 15, 13>
14. <14, 9, 13, 15>
15. <3, 7, 8, 17>
16. <1, 6, 19, 3>
17. <6, 1, 4, 15>
18. <7, 8, 17, 11>
19. <19, 6, 13, 15>
20. <5, 15, 13, 9>
21. <9, 13, 15, 5>
22. <10, 1, 4, 8>
23. <13, 9, 14, 2>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, 1, 6, 19> has a chord (1, 19)
- <2, 18, 4, 1> has a chord (18, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
Thus, there are [21] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
