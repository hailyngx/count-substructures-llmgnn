Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 11) (18, 20) (18, 16) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 0) (22, 17) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 24) (8, 11) (0, 22) (0, 14) (0, 23) (0, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (21, 28) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 15) (28, 21) (28, 11) (28, 27) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 28) (1, 15) (1, 20) (1, 10) (1, 9) (15, 21) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 13) (15, 12) (3, 20) (17, 22) (17, 5) (25, 21) (25, 10) (25, 2) (19, 22) (19, 2) (19, 10) (19, 13) (19, 9) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 7) (7, 5) (7, 29) (7, 2) (29, 7) (29, 16) (29, 23) (16, 18) (16, 29) (24, 8) (24, 12) (24, 13) (20, 18) (20, 1) (20, 3) (20, 12) (2, 25) (2, 19) (2, 7) (23, 0) (23, 15) (23, 29) (6, 14) (12, 15) (12, 24) (12, 20) (27, 21) (27, 28) (13, 0) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 24) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 25) (10, 19) (9, 1) (9, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (18, 22, 19, 10, 4, 8, 11, 18)
- Cycle 2: (18, 22, 19, 9, 1, 20, 18)
- Cycle 3: (18, 11, 8, 24, 12, 15, 1, 20, 18)
- Cycle 4: (22, 19, 9, 1, 15, 12, 24, 8, 11, 22)
- Cycle 5: (22, 19, 9, 1, 10, 4, 5, 17, 22)
- Cycle 6: (22, 0, 14, 6, 5, 4, 10, 1, 20, 22)
- Cycle 7: (22, 0, 14, 6, 5, 17, 22)
- Cycle 8: (22, 0, 23, 29, 16, 18, 20, 1, 15, 22)
- Cycle 9: (22, 17, 5, 4, 10, 19, 2, 7, 29, 23, 22)
- Cycle 10: (22, 17, 5, 7, 2, 19, 10, 4, 18, 20, 3, 22)
- Cycle 11: (22, 17, 5, 4, 8, 11, 28, 21, 25, 2, 19, 10, 4, 18, 20, 1, 10, 19, 9, 22)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <1, (19, 9)>
- <2, (2, 19)>
- <4, (4, 8)>
- <5, (5, 17)>
- <6, (22, 0)>
- <7, (22, 17)>
- <8, (18, 11)>
- <9, (22, 19)>
- <10, (29, 23)>
- <11, (4, 18)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
