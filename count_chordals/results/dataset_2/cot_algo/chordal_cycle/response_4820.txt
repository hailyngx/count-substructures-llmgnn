Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 5) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 14) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 7) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 14, 10, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 10, 11, 5, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 13, 9, 10, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 11, 6, 2, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 14, 13, 9, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 5, 11, 6, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 9, 10, 11, 7)
- Cycle 8: (10, 14, 13, 9, 10)
- Cycle 9: (10, 11, 6, 2, 10)
- Cycle 10: (11, 5, 8, 13, 11)
- Cycle 11: (5, 13, 9, 10, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 11, 6, 12, 5)
- Cycle 13: (0, 10, 11, 6, 0)
- Cycle 14: (0, 8, 5, 13, 0)
- Cycle 15: (0, 2, 6, 3, 0)
- Cycle 16: (2, 6, 11, 5, 2)
- Cycle 17: (2, 3, 0, 8, 2)
- Cycle 18: (13, 9, 1, 10, 13)
- Cycle 19: (13, 5, 8, 0, 13)
- Cycle 20: (5, 3, 0, 8, 5)
- Cycle 21: (5, 12, 6, 11, 5)
- Cycle 22: (3, 0, 8, 5, 3)
- Cycle 23: (3, 6, 11, 5, 3)
- Cycle 24: (6, 11, 5, 12, 6)
- Cycle 25: (9, 7, 5, 13, 9)
- Cycle 26: (9, 10, 11, 5, 9)
- Cycle 27: (12, 6, 11, 5, 12)
- Cycle 28: (1, 10, 11, 5, 1)
- Cycle 29: (14, 7, 5, 13, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 4 <4, 10, 11, 5>: (4, 11) is a chord.
- Cycle 5 <7, 14, 13, 9>: (7, 13) is a chord.
- Cycle 6 <7, 5, 11, 6>: (7, 11) is a chord.
- Cycle 22 <3, 0, 8, 5>: (3, 8) is a chord.
- Cycle 24 <6, 11, 5, 12>: (6, 5) is a chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 29 cycles in total and 5 of them have exactly one chord. So, the number of chordless cycles is 29 - 5 = 24.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [24].
