Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

      - Cycle 1: (4, 7, 5, 2, 4)
      - Cycle 2: (4, 7, 8, 6, 4)
      - Cycle 3: (4, 1, 0, 2, 4)
      - Cycle 4: (4, 1, 3, 9, 4)
      - Cycle 5: (7, 3, 1, 9, 7)
      
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

      - Cycle 1: (4, 7, 5, 2, 4) {Chord (7, 2)}
      - Cycle 2: (4, 7, 8, 6, 4) {Chord (7, 6)}
      - Cycle 3: (4, 1, 0, 2, 4) {Chord (1, 2)}
      - Cycle 4: (4, 1, 3, 9, 4) {Chord (1, 9)}
      - Cycle 5: (7, 3, 1, 9, 7) {Chord (3, 1)}

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

      - We found 5 chordal 4-cycles.

Therefore, the final number of chordless 4-cycles is [5]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
      - <4, 7, 5, 2>
      - <4, 7, 8, 6>
      - <4, 1, 0, 2>
      - <4, 1, 3, 9>
      - <7, 3, 1, 9>
