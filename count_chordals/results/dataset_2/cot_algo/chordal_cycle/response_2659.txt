Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 3) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 2) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph where every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 4 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 4 - 13 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 9 - 3 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 12 - 10 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 5: 6 - 10 - 4 - 14 - 6
- Cycle 6: 4 - 14 - 8 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 7: 4 - 13 - 1 - 11 - 4
- Cycle 8: 4 - 9 - 11 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 9: 7 - 4 - 9 - 3 - 7
- Cycle 10: 7 - 0 - 6 - 10 - 7
- Cycle 11: 6 - 11 - 1 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 12: 6 - 0 - 7 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 13: 14 - 8 - 1 - 11 - 14
- Cycle 14: 14 - 4 - 10 - 12 - 14
- Cycle 15: 12 - 14 - 4 - 9 - 12
- Cycle 16: 12 - 2 - 11 - 1 - 12
- Cycle 17: 12 - 5 - 9 - 4 - 12
- Cycle 18: 13 - 5 - 9 - 4 - 13
- Cycle 19: 13 - 4 - 10 - 12 - 13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 4, 7, 5> has a chord (4, 7)
- <5, 12, 10, 6, 5> has a chord (10, 6)
- <6, 10, 4, 14, 6> has a chord (4, 14)
- <4, 14, 8, 1, 4> has a chord (8, 1)
- <4, 13, 1, 11, 4> has a chord (1, 11)
- <4, 9, 11, 6, 4> has a chord (11, 6)
- <7, 4, 9, 3, 7> has a chord (9, 3)
- <7, 0, 6, 10, 7> has a chord (6, 10)
- <6, 11, 1, 8, 6> has a chord (1, 8)
- <12, 2, 11, 1, 12> has a chord (11, 1)
- <12, 5, 9, 4, 12> has a chord (9, 4)
- <13, 5, 9, 4, 13> has a chord (9, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]
