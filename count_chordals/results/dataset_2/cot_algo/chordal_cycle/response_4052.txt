Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 6) (15, 4) (4, 15) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 15) (7, 4) (7, 19) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 16) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 14) (13, 11) (1, 10) (1, 18) (19, 7) (19, 5) (19, 18) (8, 6) (8, 12) (16, 0) (16, 2) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 6) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 5) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 0) (12, 8) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 6) (17, 12) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 12)

2. Cycle <3, 15, 6, 0>
3. Cycle <3, 14, 10, 1>
4. Cycle <15, 7, 4, 10>
5. Cycle <15, 4, 7, 19>
6. Cycle <15, 6, 0, 12>
7. Cycle <4, 7, 15, 3>
8. Cycle <4, 10, 11, 9>
9. Cycle <4, 5, 19, 18>
10. Cycle <7, 15, 3, 14>
11. Cycle <7, 19, 18, 6>
12. Cycle <10, 4, 5, 14>
13. Cycle <10, 1, 18, 19>
14. Cycle <11, 10, 4, 5>
15. Cycle <11, 13, 9, 12>
16. Cycle <0, 16, 2, 4>
17. Cycle <0, 6, 15, 3>
18. Cycle <2, 4, 10, 1>
19. Cycle <2, 16, 0, 12>
20. Cycle <5, 4, 10, 1>
21. Cycle <5, 14, 3, 15>
22. Cycle <13, 11, 10, 4>
23. Cycle <1, 10, 4, 5>
24. Cycle <1, 18, 19, 7>
25. Cycle <19, 7, 4, 10>
26. Cycle <19, 5, 14, 3>
27. Cycle <8, 6, 15, 3>
28. Cycle <8, 12, 0, 16>
29. Cycle <16, 0, 6, 15>
30. Cycle <18, 1, 10, 4>
31. Cycle <18, 19, 7, 4>
32. Cycle <14, 3, 15, 6>
33. Cycle <9, 11, 10, 4>
34. Cycle <9, 12, 0, 16>
35. Cycle <12, 0, 6, 15>
36. Cycle <12, 17, 6, 15>
37. Cycle <17, 12, 0, 6>

Step 2: 

The chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <3, 15, 4, 7> has a chord (4, 7)
- <3, 14, 10, 1> has a chord (10, 1)
- <15, 4, 7, 19> has a chord (7, 19)
- <4, 7, 15, 3> has a chord (7, 15)
- <4, 10, 11, 9> has a chord (10, 11)
- <7, 15, 3, 14> has a chord (15, 3)
- <10, 1, 18, 19> has a chord (1, 18)
- <11, 10, 4, 5> has a chord (10, 4)
- <1, 10, 4, 5> has a chord (10, 4)
- <19, 7, 4, 10> has a chord (7, 4)
- <9, 11, 10, 4> has a chord (11, 10)

Step 3:

As there are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [11].
