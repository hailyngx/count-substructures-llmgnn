Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 5) (7, 17) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 5) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 13) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 18) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 17) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 17) (9, 13) (18, 1) (18, 13) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 17) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 17) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (3, 15, 1, 16, 3)
        - Cycle 2: (3, 15, 16, 1, 3)
        - Cycle 3: (3, 12, 5, 7, 3)
        - Cycle 4: (3, 12, 5, 19, 3)
        - Cycle 5: (15, 1, 9, 0, 15)
        - Cycle 6: (15, 1, 9, 13, 15)
        - Cycle 7: (15, 1, 18, 13, 15)
        - Cycle 8: (11, 8, 17, 4, 11)
        - Cycle 9: (7, 5, 12, 2, 7)
        - Cycle 10: (12, 2, 5, 19, 12)
        - Cycle 11: (0, 8, 17, 9, 0)
        - Cycle 12: (0, 8, 17, 16, 0)
        - Cycle 13: (0, 19, 4, 17, 0)
        - Cycle 14: (14, 13, 18, 1, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 and Cycle 4 have exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 5, Cycle 6, Cycle 7, and Cycle 8 have exactly one chord.
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the answer is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <1, (16, 1), 15>
        <3, (12, 5), 7>
        <3, (19, 5), 12>
        <11, (17, 4), 8>
