Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 5) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 3) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 19) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (13, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 17) (7, 6) (12, 14) (12, 19) (6, 13) (6, 7) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 15) (9, 3) (9, 2) (15, 17) (15, 4) (15, 18) (10, 3) (10, 8) (18, 11) (18, 14) (18, 13) (18, 15) (5, 16) (5, 17) (19, 16) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- (11, 16, 5, 17)
- (11, 4, 0, 1)
- (11, 8, 2, 13)
- (11, 18, 14, 17)
- (16, 19, 1, 3)
- (14, 17, 15, 18)
- (14, 12, 19, 16)
- (17, 7, 6, 13)
- (17, 5, 16, 11)
- (1, 3, 9, 2)
- (1, 0, 4, 15)
- (3, 19, 12, 14)
- (8, 13, 6, 7)
- (8, 10, 3, 1)
- (13, 18, 15, 4)
- (13, 2, 9, 3)
- (2, 8, 11, 18)
- (0, 4, 15, 17)
- (7, 17, 14, 12)
- (12, 19, 3, 1)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (a non-adjacent edge) are:
- <11, (16, 5), 17>
- <11, (4, 0), 1>
- <11, (8, 2), 13>
- <11, (18, 14), 17>
- <16, (19, 1), 3>
- <14, (17, 15), 18>
- <14, (12, 19), 16>
- <17, (7, 6), 13>
- <17, (5, 16), 11>
- <1, (3, 9), 2>
- <1, (0, 4), 15>
- <3, (19, 12), 14>
- <8, (13, 6), 7>
- <8, (10, 3), 1>
- <13, (18, 15), 4>
- <13, (2, 9), 3>
- <2, (8, 11), 18>
- <0, (4, 15), 17>
- <7, (17, 14), 12>
- <12, (19, 3), 1>

Step 3:
There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
So, the answer is [20].
