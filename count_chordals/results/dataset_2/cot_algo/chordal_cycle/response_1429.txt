Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (13, 7) (13, 3) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 3) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 10) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (0, 8, 1, 5, 2, 7, 3, 4, 10, 12) with 10 edges
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 8, 9) with 4 edges
- Cycle 3: (2, 5, 8, 9, 1) with 5 edges
- Cycle 4: (3, 0, 8, 9) with 4 edges
- Cycle 5: (4, 7, 3, 0, 8) with 5 edges
- Cycle 6: (5, 8, 0, 3, 4, 10, 12, 14, 6, 2) with 10 edges
- Cycle 7: (6, 14, 12, 10, 4, 11, 5, 1, 9, 8) with 10 edges
- Cycle 8: (7, 3, 4, 10, 12) with 5 edges
- Cycle 9: (11, 5, 2, 7, 4) with 5 edges
- Cycle 10: (13, 3, 4, 10, 12) with 5 edges

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (5, 7), 2, 8, 3, 4, 10, 12> 
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (5, 14), 7, 4> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
[2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are <1, (5, 7), 2, 8, 3, 4, 10, 12> and <2, (5, 14), 7, 4>.
