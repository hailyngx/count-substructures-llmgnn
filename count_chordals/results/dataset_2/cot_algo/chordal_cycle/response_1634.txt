Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 19) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 19) (2, 6) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 16) (11, 13) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 15) (13, 14) (17, 15) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 8) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (10, 0) (10, 4) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 19) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 3) (19, 7) (8, 0) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 8) (14, 12) (4, 1) (4, 10) (12, 1) (12, 14) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-7-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-13-11-5
- Cycle 3: 5-18-16-15-5
- Cycle 4: 5-1-3-7-5
- Cycle 5: 6-7-3-1-6
- Cycle 6: 6-13-11-15-6
- Cycle 7: 1-5-9-6-1
- Cycle 8: 1-3-7-6-1
- Cycle 9: 1-19-6-2-1
- Cycle 10: 3-7-6-2-3
- Cycle 11: 18-16-0-10-18
- Cycle 12: 18-15-17-16-18
- Cycle 13: 13-15-17-18-13
- Cycle 14: 13-6-7-3-13
- Cycle 15: 0-5-9-13-0
- Cycle 16: 0-3-7-19-0
- Cycle 17: 0-16-15-17-0
- Cycle 18: 0-10-4-1-0
- Cycle 19: 7-6-2-18-7
- Cycle 20: 7-3-1-4-7

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Among the cycles listed above, only one of them has exactly one chord, which is Cycle 1: 5-9-6-7-5. The chord in this cycle is edge (9, 7).

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <5, 9, 7, 6>
