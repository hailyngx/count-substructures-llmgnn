Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (7, 5) (7, 12) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 6, 5>
2. <0, 8, 11, 10>
3. <0, 12, 7, 5>
4. <0, 14, 11, 4>
5. <1, 6, 10, 9>
6. <1, 3, 10, 9>
7. <1, 14, 11, 4>
8. <4, 8, 11, 10>
9. <4, 12, 7, 5>
10. <4, 13, 9, 10>
11. <8, 6, 5, 7>
12. <12, 7, 5, 6>
  
Step 2: 
Out of these cycles, we look for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 6, 5> has chord (1, 6)
- <0, 12, 7, 5> has chord (7, 12)
- <0, 14, 11, 4> has chord (11, 14)
- <1, 3, 10, 9> has chord (3, 10)
- <4, 13, 9, 10> has chord (9, 13)

Step 3:
Three chordal 4-cycles are found, so the final count is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <0, 1, 6, 5> with chord (1, 6)
2. <0, 12, 7, 5> with chord (7, 12)
3. <0, 14, 11, 4> with chord (11, 14)
