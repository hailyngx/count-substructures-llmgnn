Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 6, 9, 1)
- (1, 6, 8, 1)
- (1, 8, 7, 1)
- (1, 8, 6, 1)
- (1, 8, 7, 4)
- (1, 7, 4, 6)
- (1, 7, 8, 1)
- (1, 7, 4, 6)
- (1, 9, 6, 4)
- (1, 9, 3, 4)
- (1, 3, 4, 7)
- (1, 3, 4, 6)
- (1, 0, 3, 4)
- (1, 0, 2, 5)
- (1, 0, 3, 9)
- (1, 0, 2, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (7, 8), 4>
- <1, (9, 6), 4>
- <1, (3, 4), 7>
- <1, (2, 5), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
