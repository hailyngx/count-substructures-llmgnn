Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 3) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 6) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 11) (6, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 2-7-4-8-2
2. Cycle 2: 2-7-5-13-2
3. Cycle 3: 2-7-0-6-2
4. Cycle 4: 2-8-4-9-2
5. Cycle 5: 2-8-6-0-2
6. Cycle 6: 2-13-5-7-2
7. Cycle 7: 3-11-5-13-3
8. Cycle 8: 3-11-6-4-3
9. Cycle 9: 3-14-7-0-3
10. Cycle 10: 3-14-1-9-3
11. Cycle 11: 4-11-3-6-4
12. Cycle 12: 4-6-0-7-4
13. Cycle 13: 4-6-1-9-4
14. Cycle 14: 5-11-3-10-5
15. Cycle 15: 5-13-0-7-5
16. Cycle 16: 6-0-7-14-6
17. Cycle 17: 6-1-9-8-6
18. Cycle 18: 7-14-13-5-7
19. Cycle 19: 8-6-1-14-8
20. Cycle 20: 10-3-11-4-10
21. Cycle 21: 12-2-8-10-12
22. Cycle 22: 12-13-5-11-12

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 is chordal: <1, (4, 8), 2>
- Cycle 2 is chordal: <2, (5, 13), 7>
- Cycle 3 is chordal: <3, (0, 6), 7>
- Cycle 4 is chordal: <4, (9, 8), 2>
- Cycle 5 is chordal: <5, (0, 6), 8>
- Cycle 6 is chordal: <6, (7, 5), 2>
- Cycle 7 is chordal: <7, (5, 13), 3>
- Cycle 8 is chordal: <8, (6, 11), 4>
- Cycle 9 is chordal: <9, (1, 9), 3>
- Cycle 10 is not chordal.
- Cycle 11 is chordal: <11, (3, 6), 7>
- Cycle 12 is not chordal.
- Cycle 13 is not chordal.
- Cycle 14 is chordal: <14, (1, 9), 6>
- Cycle 15 is chordal: <15, (0, 7), 3>
- Cycle 16 is not chordal.
- Cycle 17 is not chordal.
- Cycle 18 is chordal: <18, (13, 5), 7>
- Cycle 19 is chordal: <19, (6, 1), 8>
- Cycle 20 is chordal: <20, (4, 11), 3>
- Cycle 21 is chordal: <21, (8, 2), 10>
- Cycle 22 is chordal: <22, (11, 5), 12>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found. 
Therefore, the final count is [6].
