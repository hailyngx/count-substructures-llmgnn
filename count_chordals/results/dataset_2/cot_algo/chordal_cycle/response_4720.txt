Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 16) (26, 18) (26, 5) (26, 10) (26, 15) (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 4) (15, 26) (15, 3) (15, 13) (15, 11) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 2) (27, 0) (27, 1) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 22) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 29) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 19) (11, 15) (11, 28) (11, 8) (11, 29) (28, 11) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 17) (18, 29) (13, 15) (13, 17) (13, 20) (13, 10) (17, 18) (17, 13) (23, 16) (23, 29) (23, 21) (1, 27) (1, 14) (1, 6) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 20) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 20) (5, 26) (5, 8) (5, 16) (10, 26) (10, 12) (10, 13) (19, 14) (19, 18) (19, 25) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 21) (8, 11) (8, 5) (20, 13) (20, 6) (20, 2) (20, 24) (4, 3) (24, 20) (24, 22) (24, 21) (16, 9) (16, 23) (16, 5) (22, 7) (22, 24) (21, 23) (21, 25) (21, 24) (29, 12) (29, 11) (29, 18) (29, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 8, 11, 29)
        - Cycle 2: (6, 3, 15, 11)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 8, 11, 15)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 8, 11, 29)
        - Cycle 5: (3, 15, 26, 5)
        - Cycle 6: (7, 6, 3, 15)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has no chord.
        - Cycle 2 has a chord: (3, 11).
        - Cycle 3 has a chord: (8, 15).
        - Cycle 4 has no chord.
        - Cycle 5 has a chord: (15, 5).
        - Cycle 6 has a chord: (6, 15).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        - <1, (3, 11), 29>
        - <1, (8, 15), 11>
