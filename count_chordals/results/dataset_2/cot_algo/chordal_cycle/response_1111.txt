Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 0) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 13) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 2) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 1) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (0, 6, 9, 8, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 6, 3, 13, 1, 12, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 3, 14, 1, 12, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 6, 3, 14, 10, 13, 1, 12, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 8, 10, 13, 1, 12, 0)
- Cycle 6: (1, 12, 0, 8, 9, 6, 3, 13, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 12, 0, 8, 9, 6, 3, 14, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 12, 0, 8, 10, 13, 3, 6, 9, 8, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle (0, 6, 9, 8, 0) has a chord (6, 8)
- The cycle (1, 12, 0, 8, 10, 13, 3, 6, 9, 8, 0) has a chord (10, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 6, 9, 8, 0> (Chord: (6, 8))
- <1, 12, 0, 8, 10, 13, 3, 6, 9, 8, 0> (Chord: (10, 6))
