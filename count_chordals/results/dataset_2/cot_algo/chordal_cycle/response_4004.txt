Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (1, 5, 7, 4, 1)
        - Cycle 2: (1, 6, 4, 7, 1)
        - Cycle 3: (1, 6, 4, 0, 1)
        - Cycle 4: (1, 3, 9, 8, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord (4, 7), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
        - Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 0), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
        - Cycle 3 has no chords.
        - Cycle 4 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].

Unique Chordal 4-Cycles:
        <(1, 5, 7, 4), (4, 7), 1)>
        <(1, 6, 4, 7), (4, 0), 1)>
