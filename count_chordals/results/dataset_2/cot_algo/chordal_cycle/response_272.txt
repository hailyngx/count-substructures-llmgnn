Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 9) (21, 13) (21, 0) (21, 19) (21, 4) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 23) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 11) (4, 21) (4, 8) (4, 22) (4, 23) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 20) (8, 15) (8, 7) (6, 2) (28, 26) (28, 22) (22, 4) (22, 28) (22, 26) (26, 28) (26, 22) (26, 18) (26, 20) (26, 11) (5, 18) (13, 21) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 19) (16, 12) (18, 14) (18, 26) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 3) (9, 1) (9, 29) (9, 3) (29, 9) (29, 27) (29, 25) (29, 24) (0, 21) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (25, 29) (25, 27) (25, 11) (27, 29) (27, 25) (27, 11) (10, 1) (12, 13) (12, 16) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 18) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 9) (3, 7) (24, 29) (20, 8) (20, 26) (20, 23) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 23) (23, 14) (23, 4) (23, 20) (23, 15) (2, 6) (2, 7) (11, 17) (11, 26) (11, 13) (11, 25) (11, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <2, 6, 2>
2. Cycle <2, 6, 2, 7, 3, 9, 1, 10, 1>
3. Cycle <3, 4, 21, 13, 19, 8, 4>
4. Cycle <3, 4, 21, 13, 19, 18, 26, 20, 23, 15, 23>
5. Cycle <4, 21, 13, 19, 8, 4>
6. Cycle <4, 21, 13, 19, 18, 26, 20, 23, 15, 23>
7. Cycle <13, 21, 4, 23, 15, 17, 11>
8. Cycle <13, 21, 4, 23, 15, 17, 14>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. Chordal 4-cycle <3, 4, 21, 13, 19, 8, 4> with chord (13, 19)   -> This cycle has 1 chord.
2. Chordal 4-cycle <4, 21, 13, 19, 8, 4> with chord (13, 19)     -> This cycle has 1 chord.

Step 3:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, each with exactly one chord. Thus, the total number of chordless cycles is [2].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles inside <> are <3, 4, 21, 13, 19, 8, 4> and <4, 21, 13, 19, 8, 4> with the specified chords.
