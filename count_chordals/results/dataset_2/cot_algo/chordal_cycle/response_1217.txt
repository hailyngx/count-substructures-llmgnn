Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (4, 18) (4, 9) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (11, 6) (15, 19) (15, 13) (13, 15) (13, 17) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 5) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 16) (16, 0) (16, 9) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 9) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 17) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 12) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) (5, 17) (5, 12) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1:
- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 2, 0, 17>
- Cycle 2: <3, 11, 18, 10, 7>
- Cycle 3: <2, 8, 12, 5, 17>
- Cycle 4: <13, 15, 19, 14, 7>
- Cycle 5: <9, 4, 18, 11, 6>
- Cycle 6: <16, 0, 2, 9, 12>
- Cycle 7: <17, 13, 15, 19, 14>
- Cycle 8: <10, 3, 2, 9, 4>
  
Step 2:
- Checking for chords in each cycle:
  - Cycle 1 has no chords.
  - Cycle 2 has no chords.
  - Cycle 3 has chord <8, 6>.
  - Cycle 4 has chord <15, 7>.
  - Cycle 5 has no chords.
  - Cycle 6 has chord <0, 9>.
  - Cycle 7 has chord <13, 19>.
  - Cycle 8 has no chords.

Step 3:
- Count of chordless cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 3, 2, 0, 17>
- <3, 11, 18, 10, 7>
- <9, 4, 18, 11, 6>
- <10, 3, 2, 9, 4>
