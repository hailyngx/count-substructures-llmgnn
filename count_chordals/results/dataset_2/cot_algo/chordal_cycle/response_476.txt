Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 19) (3, 18) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 2) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 10) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 6) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 19) (0, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 13) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 16) (16, 14) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 9) (19, 3) (19, 6) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 13) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 18) (18, 3) (18, 16) (18, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Possible cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-1-10-0-4
- Cycle 2: 4-1-10-12-4
- Cycle 3: 4-11-13-12-4
- Cycle 4: 5-6-2-7-5
- Cycle 5: 5-6-2-9-5
- Cycle 6: 5-12-13-11-5
- Cycle 7: 8-4-1-10-8
- Cycle 8: 8-4-11-13-8
- Cycle 9: 8-17-5-12-8
- Cycle 10: 8-17-6-2-8
- Cycle 11: 10-1-4-11-10
- Cycle 12: 10-12-13-11-10
- Cycle 13: 10-12-5-17-10
- Cycle 14: 12-5-17-6-12
- Cycle 15: 16-10-12-13-16
- Cycle 16: 16-10-1-4-16
- Cycle 17: 16-18-13-11-16
- Cycle 18: 16-18-3-19-16
- Cycle 19: 18-16-10-1-18
- Cycle 20: 18-16-10-12-18

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <4, (1, 10)>
2. <8, (5, 17)>
3. <8, (6, 2)>
4. <10, (1, 4)>
5. <12, (5, 17)>
6. <16, (10, 12)>
7. <16, (1, 18)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
