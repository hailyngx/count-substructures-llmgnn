Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 15) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 15) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 16) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 7) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 16) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 15) (18, 9) (18, 13) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 1) (7, 3) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 5) (5, 14) (5, 2) (19, 10) (19, 16) (15, 14) (15, 4) (15, 9) (12, 10) (12, 3) (13, 18) (0, 17) (16, 8) (16, 6) (16, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <1, 7, 3, 6, 1>
- Cycle 2: <2, 5, 14, 1, 2>
- Cycle 3: <3, 6, 11, 9, 3>
- Cycle 4: <4, 8, 10, 12, 4>
- Cycle 5: <10, 11, 9, 18, 10>
- Cycle 6: <14, 15, 9, 18, 14>
- Cycle 7: <16, 6, 3, 7, 16>
- Cycle 8: <17, 7, 1, 14, 17>
- Cycle 9: <19, 16, 6, 3, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <3, 7>.
- Cycle 2 has a chord <1, 14>.
- Cycle 3 has a chord <6, 11>.
- Cycle 4 has a chord <4, 10>.
- Cycle 5 has a chord <9, 11>.
- Cycle 6 has a chord <9, 14>.
- Cycle 7 has a chord <3, 7>.
- Cycle 8 has a chord <1, 14>.
- Cycle 9 has a chord <6, 16>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
