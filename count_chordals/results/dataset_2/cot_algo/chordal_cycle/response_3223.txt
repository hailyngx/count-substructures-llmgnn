Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 24) (15, 2) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 7) (29, 20) (29, 5) (29, 24) (29, 11) (14, 17) (14, 28) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 9) (8, 19) (8, 5) (13, 21) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 22) (1, 23) (1, 0) (26, 5) (26, 16) (6, 28) (6, 5) (6, 18) (28, 14) (28, 6) (28, 21) (21, 13) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 18) (5, 29) (5, 8) (5, 26) (5, 6) (5, 11) (4, 27) (4, 23) (27, 4) (27, 23) (20, 29) (20, 12) (11, 29) (11, 5) (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 0) (23, 1) (23, 4) (23, 27) (23, 11) (19, 15) (19, 8) (24, 15) (24, 29) (24, 9) (22, 10) (22, 11) (22, 16) (0, 1) (0, 21) (0, 11) (0, 12) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 24) (12, 14) (12, 20) (12, 0) (16, 3) (16, 26) (16, 22) (16, 18) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 10) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 21) (18, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
        - Cycle 1: <0, 1, 23, 27, 4>
        - Cycle 2: <0, 11, 22, 16, 3>
        - Cycle 3: <0, 12, 20, 29, 5>
        - Cycle 4: <1, 23, 27, 4, 23>
        - Cycle 5: <3, 15, 19, 8, 5>
        - Cycle 6: <3, 16, 26, 5, 29>
        - Cycle 7: <5, 6, 28, 14, 7>
        - Cycle 8: <5, 8, 19, 15, 2>
        - Cycle 9: <6, 18, 21, 13, 28>
        - Cycle 10: <7, 10, 17, 14, 12>
        - Cycle 11: <9, 2, 15, 24, 29>
        - Cycle 12: <9, 17, 10, 7, 14>
        - Cycle 13: <11, 0, 1, 23, 4>
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 is chordal with one chord <1, 27>
        - Cycle 2 is chordal with one chord <11, 16>
        - Cycle 3 is chordal with one chord <12, 20>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
        1. <0, 1, 23, 27> with chord <1, 27>
        2. <0, 11, 22, 16> with chord <11, 16>
        3. <0, 12, 20, 29> with chord <12, 20>
