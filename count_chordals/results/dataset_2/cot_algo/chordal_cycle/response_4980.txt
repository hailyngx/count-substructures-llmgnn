Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 12) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 13) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 0) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 14) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-4-8-1
- Cycle 2: 3-1-4-8-3
- Cycle 3: 1-4-12-8-1
- Cycle 4: 3-1-12-8-3
- Cycle 5: 4-1-8-12-4
- Cycle 6: 11-7-4-14-11
- Cycle 7: 1-5-11-13-1
- Cycle 8: 3-5-11-13-3
- Cycle 9: 10-14-7-0-10
- Cycle 10: 9-10-0-7-9
- Cycle 11: 6-7-11-9-6
- Cycle 12: 6-7-14-10-6
- Cycle 13: 0-12-8-4-0
- Cycle 14: 2-10-9-6-2
- Cycle 15: 5-11-7-6-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (3, 8), 4, 12>
- <3, (1, 8), 4, 12>
- <4, (1, 8), 12, 3>
- <11, (7, 14), 4, 7>
- <1, (5, 11), 13, 1>
- <3, (5, 11), 13, 3>
- <10, (14, 7), 0, 10>
- <9, (10, 0), 7, 9>
- <6, (7, 11), 9, 6>
- <6, (7, 14), 10, 6>
- <0, (8, 4), 12, 0>
- <2, (10, 9), 6, 2>
- <5, (11, 7), 6, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [14].
