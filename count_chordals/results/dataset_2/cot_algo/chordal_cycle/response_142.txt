Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 0) (9, 21) (9, 13) (26, 9) (26, 25) (26, 11) (26, 4) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 20) (8, 18) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 21) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 17) (12, 0) (28, 11) (28, 24) (29, 9) (29, 15) (6, 17) (6, 19) (11, 26) (11, 28) (11, 2) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 24) (5, 14) (25, 26) (25, 16) (25, 2) (15, 13) (15, 29) (15, 16) (15, 10) (16, 25) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 27) (20, 8) (2, 11) (2, 25) (22, 14) (17, 12) (17, 6) (17, 24) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 18) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 17) (24, 27) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 0) (14, 5) (14, 22) (14, 21) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 23) (23, 18) (27, 16) (27, 24) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 19) (21, 9) (21, 4) (21, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 9-26-4-21-9
- Cycle 2: 9-29-15-13-9
- Cycle 3: 9-0-12-6-17-24-27-0
- Cycle 4: 9-13-8-18-3-10-15-29-9
- Cycle 5: 26-25-2-11-28-24-5-3-1-26
- Cycle 6: 26-4-8-13-5-12-17-6-19-26
- Cycle 7: 3-1-26-4-21-14-22-5-3
- Cycle 8: 3-5-12-0-19-16-25-2-11-3
- Cycle 9: 8-13-15-29-26-25-16-18-8
- Cycle 10: 8-18-16-19-6-17-24-28-11-8

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <9, (13, 15), 29>
- <26, (25, 2), 4>
- <9, (0, 12), 6, 17, 24, 27>
- <9, 13, (15, 29), 8>
- <2, (25, 11), 3, 5, 26>
- <4, (8, 5), 26, 21>
- <1, (26, 4), 22, 3>
- <3, (5, 0), 19, 16>
- <8, (13, 15), 26, 18>
- <8, (16, 6), 17, 24, 28, 11>

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
