24. Cycle 24: 13-7-4-0-13
25. Cycle 25: 13-12-5-8-13
26. Cycle 26: 3-9-6-7-3

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 <6, 9, 14, 6> has chord (9, 14)
- Cycle 2 <6, 7, 4, 11, 6> has chord (7, 11)
- Cycle 3 <6, 2, 4, 7, 6> does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 4 <9, 14, 10, 13, 9> has chord (14, 10)
- Cycle 5 <9, 3, 2, 4, 9> has chord (3, 4)
- Cycle 6 <4, 7, 13, 10, 4> has chord (7, 13)
- Cycle 7 <4, 0, 8, 2, 4> has chord (0, 8)
- Cycle 8 <4, 11, 5, 12, 4> has chord (11, 12)
- Cycle 9 <7, 6, 2, 8, 7> has chord (6, 2)
- Cycle 10 <2, 6, 9, 3, 2> has chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 11 <2, 1, 10, 13, 2> has chord (1, 10)
- Cycle 12 <2, 3, 8, 5, 2> has chord (3, 8)
- Cycle 13 <8, 5, 12, 0, 8> has chord (5, 12)
- Cycle 14 <0, 4, 1, 10, 0> has chord (4, 1)
- Cycle 15 <0, 12, 5, 11, 0> has chord (12, 5)
- Cycle 16 <10, 3, 9, 14, 10> has chord (3, 14)
- Cycle 17 <5, 8, 2, 3, 5> has chord (8, 2)
- Cycle 18 <5, 11, 4, 2, 5> has chord (11, 4)
- Cycle 19 <5, 3, 9, 12, 5> has chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 20 <14, 10, 1, 4, 14> has chord (10, 1)
- Cycle 21 <1, 2, 6, 11, 1> has chord (2, 11)
- Cycle 22 <12, 0, 4, 11, 12> has chord (0, 11)
- Cycle 23 <12, 13, 10, 1, 12> has chord (13, 1)
