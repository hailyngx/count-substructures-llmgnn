Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <1, 5, 2, 6, 7>
- <1, 5, 3, 7, 8>
- <1, 5, 3, 8, 6>
- <1, 9, 6, 7, 8>
- <1, 9, 6, 8, 4>
- <1, 9, 4, 8, 7>
- <1, 9, 4, 0, 6>
- <1, 4, 8, 7, 6>
- <1, 4, 8, 6, 0>
- <1, 7, 8, 6, 0>
- <1, 7, 3, 5, 2>
- <1, 7, 3, 8, 6>
- <1, 0, 4, 9, 6>
- <1, 0, 4, 8, 6>
- <1, 0, 6, 9, 4>
- <1, 0, 6, 7, 3>
- <1, 0, 2, 6, 9>
- <1, 0, 2, 5, 3>
- <3, 5, 2, 6, 7>
- <3, 5, 2, 0, 6>
- <3, 7, 6, 9, 4>
- <3, 7, 6, 8, 4>
- <3, 7, 8, 4, 0>
- <4, 9, 6, 7, 8>
- <4, 9, 6, 8, 3>
- <4, 9, 1, 5, 3>
- <4, 9, 1, 7, 8>
- <4, 8, 7, 6, 0>
- <4, 8, 6, 9, 1>
- <4, 8, 6, 7, 3>
- <7, 6, 9, 4, 0>
- <7, 6, 8, 3, 5>
- <7, 1, 9, 6, 8>
- <7, 1, 9, 4, 0>
- <7, 1, 4, 8, 6>
- <0, 9, 6, 7, 3>
- <0, 9, 4, 8, 6>
- <0, 6, 7, 3, 5>
- <0, 6, 9, 4, 8>
- <0, 6, 1, 9, 4>
- <0, 4, 8, 6, 7>
  
Step 2:  
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, 5, 2, 6, 7> with chord (1, 6)
- <1, 9, 6, 8, 4> with chord (9, 8)
- <1, 7, 3, 8, 6> with chord (7, 3)
- <3, 7, 6, 9, 4> with chord (7, 9)
- <7, 1, 9, 6, 8> with chord (1, 8)
- <0, 9, 6, 7, 3> with chord (0, 7)
- <0, 6, 1, 9, 4> with chord (6, 1)
  
Step 3:
Count of chordless 4-cycles = [40 - 7 = 33]
