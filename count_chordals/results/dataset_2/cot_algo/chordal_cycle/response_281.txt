Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1-3-7-5-1
2. Cycle 1-3-8-4-9-6-2-5-1
3. Cycle 1-8-6-2-9-4-7-5-1

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 1-3-7-5-1 has one chord (3, 5)
2. Cycle 1-3-8-4-9-6-2-5-1 has one chord (3, 2)
3. Cycle 1-8-6-2-9-4-7-5-1 has one chord (8, 4)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [0] chordless 4-cycles in the graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (3, 5), 7, 5>
<1, 3, (3, 2), 5>
<1, 8, 6, (8, 4)>
