Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles (Cycles with exactly one chord):
- <9, 10, 1, 3> (Chord: (9, 10))
- <9, 10, 5, 13> (Chord: (9, 10))
- <21, 7, 12, 18> (Chord: (21, 12))
- <21, 12, 18, 14> (Chord: (21, 12))
- <10, 11, 29, 6> (Chord: (10, 6))
- <10, 25, 0, 23> (Chord: (10, 25))
- <4, 9, 24, 20> (Chord: (9, 24))

Step 3:
Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [7]
