Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- The cycles in this graph are:  
<0, 7, 6, 0>  
<0, 7, 4, 1, 8, 5, 2, 6, 0>  
<0, 7, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 0>  
<0, 7, 4, 3, 9, 8, 5, 2, 6, 0>  
<0, 7, 4, 3, 9, 8, 1, 5, 2, 6, 0>  
<1, 5, 2, 6, 7, 0, 3, 4, 1>  
<1, 5, 2, 6, 7, 4, 3, 0, 9, 8, 1>  
<1, 5, 2, 7, 4, 3, 0, 6, 5, 1>  
<1, 5, 2, 7, 6, 0, 3, 4, 1>  
<2, 5, 1, 4, 3, 0, 6, 7, 2>  
<2, 5, 1, 4, 7, 6, 0, 3, 2>  
<2, 5, 1, 8, 9, 3, 0, 6, 7, 2>  
<2, 5, 1, 8, 9, 4, 7, 2>  
<3, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 7, 0, 3>  
<3, 4, 1, 8, 9, 0, 7, 6, 2, 5, 3>  
<3, 4, 7, 2, 6, 0, 9, 8, 1, 5, 3>  
<4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 7, 0, 3, 4>  
<4, 1, 8, 5, 2, 6, 7, 0, 3, 9, 4>  
<4, 3, 0, 6, 7, 2, 5, 1, 8, 9, 4>  
<5, 2, 6, 7, 0, 3, 4, 1, 5>  
<6, 7, 0, 3, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6>  
<7, 0, 3, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 7>  
<8, 1, 5, 2, 6, 0, 3, 4, 8>  
<8, 1, 5, 2, 7, 4, 3, 0, 9, 8>  
<8, 4, 3, 0, 6, 7, 2, 5, 1, 8>  
<9, 3, 0, 6, 7, 2, 5, 1, 8, 9>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (5, 7), 2)>.  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
- The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [26].
