Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 14) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 5) (7, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (14, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 9) (9, 3) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-11-10-4-2
- Cycle 2: 1-3-11-7-5-14
- Cycle 3: 1-3-11-6-8-7
- Cycle 4: 1-3-12-13-7-5
- Cycle 5: 1-6-8-7-5-14
- Cycle 6: 1-5-7-8-6-11
- Cycle 7: 3-11-10-4-2-0
- Cycle 8: 3-11-7-5-14-6
- Cycle 9: 3-12-13-7-5-14
- Cycle 10: 3-9-10-4-2-0
- Cycle 11: 8-3-11-7-5-14
- Cycle 12: 8-6-11-7-5-14
- Cycle 13: 13-12-10-4-2-0
- Cycle 14: 13-7-5-14-6-11
- Cycle 15: 10-11-7-5-14-6

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (10, 2), 4>
- Cycle 2: <1, (7, 14), 11>
- Cycle 3: <1, (5, 6), 8>
- Cycle 4: <1, (13, 12), 7>
- Cycle 5: <1, (7, 5), 8>
- Cycle 6: <1, (6, 5), 8>
- Cycle 7: <3, (4, 0), 11>
- Cycle 8: <3, (6, 5), 14>
- Cycle 9: <3, (13, 7), 12>
- Cycle 10: <3, (2, 10), 4>
- Cycle 11: <8, (14, 5), 11>
- Cycle 12: <8, (6, 5), 11>
- Cycle 13: <13, (2, 4), 10>
- Cycle 14: <13, (6, 5), 7>
- Cycle 15: <10, (14, 5), 11>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count is [15].
