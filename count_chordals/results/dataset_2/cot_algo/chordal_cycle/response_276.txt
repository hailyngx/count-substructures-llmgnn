Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 5) (6, 18) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 18) (5, 16) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 14) (18, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 18) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 17) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 10) (10, 15) (10, 19) (10, 0) (10, 13) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 12) (0, 15) (0, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (17, 15) (17, 12) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 3) (8, 14) (14, 5) (14, 8) (13, 10) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<1, 16, 5, 19>
<2, 5, 16, 1>
<4, 7, 9, 1>
<4, 7, 9, 3>
<4, 12, 2, 19>
<4, 12, 17, 15>
<5, 16, 1, 9>
<7, 9, 1, 16>
<8, 16, 1, 9>
<12, 4, 7, 9>
<12, 4, 18, 6>
<12, 2, 5, 16>
<13, 10, 15, 1>
<13, 10, 19, 5>
<14, 5, 16, 1>
<15, 1, 16, 8>
<15, 1, 9, 7>
<15, 17, 12, 4>
<16, 1, 9, 3>
<18, 6, 12, 4>
<19, 5, 16, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 16, 5, 19> has chord (16, 5)
- <2, 5, 16, 1> has chord (5, 16)
- <4, 7, 9, 1> has chord (7, 1)
- <4, 7, 9, 3> has chord (9, 3)
- <4, 12, 2, 19> has chord (12, 2)
- <4, 12, 17, 15> has chord (12, 17)
- <5, 16, 1, 9> has chord (16, 1)
- <7, 9, 1, 16> has chord (9, 1)
- <8, 16, 1, 9> has chord (16, 1)
- <12, 4, 7, 9> has chord (4, 9)
- <12, 4, 18, 6> has chord (4, 18)
- <12, 2, 5, 16> has chord (12, 5)
- <13, 10, 15, 1> has chord (10, 15)
- <13, 10, 19, 5> has chord (10, 19)
- <14, 5, 16, 1> has chord (5, 16)
- <15, 1, 16, 8> has chord (1, 16)
- <15, 1, 9, 7> has chord (1, 9)
- <15, 17, 12, 4> has chord (17, 12)
- <16, 1, 9, 3> has chord (1, 9)
- <18, 6, 12, 4> has chord (6, 12)
- <19, 5, 16, 1> has chord (5, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles found in this graph, so the final count is [20].
