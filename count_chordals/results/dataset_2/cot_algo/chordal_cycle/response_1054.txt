Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 6) (22, 28) (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 29) (15, 28) (27, 10) (27, 9) (14, 4) (14, 10) (17, 18) (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 19) (21, 24) (20, 15) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 28) (29, 15) (29, 5) (28, 22) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 8) (3, 21) (3, 11) (3, 5) (11, 3) (11, 23) (25, 7) (25, 16) (25, 4) (25, 2) (1, 15) (1, 23) (1, 0) (8, 20) (8, 28) (8, 19) (8, 10) (19, 21) (19, 8) (19, 6) (19, 0) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 25) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 10) (16, 25) (16, 26) (6, 22) (6, 19) (6, 24) (24, 21) (24, 6) (24, 9) (24, 2) (23, 11) (23, 1) (2, 25) (2, 24) (2, 5) (5, 29) (5, 3) (5, 2) (18, 17) (26, 7) (26, 20) (26, 16) (26, 0) (0, 1) (0, 19) (0, 26) (10, 27) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 12) (9, 13) (9, 27) (9, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph

- Cycle 1: (4, 14, 10, 27, 9, 24, 2, 25)
- Cycle 2: (4, 14, 10, 8, 19, 21, 7, 25)
- Cycle 3: (13, 22, 6, 19, 21, 7, 25, 4)
- Cycle 4: (15, 20, 26, 7, 21, 19, 8, 28)
- Cycle 5: (15, 20, 26, 0, 1, 23, 11, 3)
- Cycle 6: (15, 20, 26, 16, 25, 2, 5, 29)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord

- Cycle 1 has no chords
- Cycle 2 has the chord (21, 25)
- Cycle 3 has the chord (6, 22)
- Cycle 4 has the chord (20, 28)
- Cycle 5 has the chord (1, 23)
- Cycle 6 has the chord (5, 29)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found

There are 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, 14, 10, 27> with chord (10, 27) inside ().
