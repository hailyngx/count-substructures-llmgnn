Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph. We need to check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Here are the cycles in the graph:
1. Cycle 1: 0-1-4-8-5-0
2. Cycle 2: 0-1-4-6-5-0
3. Cycle 3: 0-1-7-9-8-4-0
4. Cycle 4: 0-1-7-9-3-0
5. Cycle 5: 0-2-4-8-5-0
6. Cycle 6: 0-2-4-6-5-0
7. Cycle 7: 0-2-3-9-8-4-0
8. Cycle 8: 0-2-3-9-7-1-0
9. Cycle 9: 0-3-2-5-0
10. Cycle 10: 0-3-9-8-5-0
11. Cycle 11: 0-3-9-7-1-0
12. Cycle 12: 0-5-8-4-1-0
13. Cycle 13: 0-5-8-4-2-0
14. Cycle 14: 0-5-3-9-7-1-0
15. Cycle 15: 0-5-3-9-8-4-0

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3 has a chord (7, 9)  <3, (7, 9), 4)>
- Cycle 4 has a chord (1, 9)  <4, (1, 9), 0)>
- Cycle 5 has a chord (2, 4)  <5, (2, 4), 8)>
- Cycle 6 has a chord (2, 4)  <6, (2, 4), 8)>
- Cycle 7 has a chord (2, 3)  <7, (2, 3), 9)>
- Cycle 8 has a chord (1, 7)  <8, (1, 7), 9)>
- Cycle 10 has a chord (3, 9)  <10, (3, 9), 8)>
- Cycle 11 has a chord (3, 9)  <11, (3, 9), 8)>
- Cycle 13 has a chord (4, 2)  <13, (4, 2), 8)>
- Cycle 14 has a chord (4, 2)  <14, (4, 2), 8)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles identified.

So, the final answer is [8].
