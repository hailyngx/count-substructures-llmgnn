Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 4) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 7) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 12) (2, 14) (2, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: 10-0-5-6
- Cycle 2: 10-0-5-4
- Cycle 3: 10-0-4-6
- Cycle 4: 11-7-3-14
- Cycle 5: 11-7-3-5
- Cycle 6: 11-7-1-8
- Cycle 7: 11-7-1-12
- Cycle 8: 13-4-0-5
- Cycle 9: 13-4-0-10
- Cycle 10: 13-9-1-8
- Cycle 11: 13-9-1-12

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Cycle 1 has a chord (0, 6)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (0, 5)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (0, 4)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (7, 14)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (3, 7)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (1, 12)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (0, 5)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (0, 10)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (1, 12)
- Cycle 11 has a chord (1, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:

There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <10, (0, 6), 5, 6>
- <10, (0, 5), 6, 5>
- <10, (0, 4), 4, 6>
- <11, (7, 14), 3, 5>
- <11, (3, 7), 7, 5>
- <13, (1, 12), 9, 1>
