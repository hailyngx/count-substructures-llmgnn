Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles of length 4 in the given graph. We can list them:
- Cycle 1: 0-6-8-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-6-4-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-6-5-4-0
- Cycle 4: 1-0-2-8-1
- Cycle 5: 1-0-7-3-1
- Cycle 6: 2-8-1-0-2
- Cycle 7: 2-8-6-0-2
- Cycle 8: 3-7-0-6-3
- Cycle 9: 3-7-1-0-3
- Cycle 10: 4-0-6-8-4
- Cycle 11: 4-0-2-3-4
- Cycle 12: 5-6-0-7-5
- Cycle 13: 5-6-4-2-5
- Cycle 14: 6-0-7-3-6
- Cycle 15: 6-0-2-4-6
- Cycle 16: 7-3-2-8-7
- Cycle 17: 8-2-4-6-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Examining each cycle, we find that none of the cycles listed above have exactly one chord. Hence, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this given graph.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As there are no chordal 4-cycles, the count of chordless 4-cycles is [0].
