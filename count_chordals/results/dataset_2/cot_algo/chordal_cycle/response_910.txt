Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 12) (16, 19) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 15) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 11) (8, 15) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 18) (2, 5) (2, 6) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 0) (17, 11) (17, 5) (17, 12) (3, 7) (3, 18) (3, 9) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 14) (0, 16) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 0) (14, 18) (14, 5) (14, 15) (19, 16) (19, 4) (19, 10) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 19) (9, 13) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 17, 11, 8, 15, 1, 0, 16, 12, 17, 5, 4)
- Cycle 2: (7, 6, 11, 8, 15, 1, 10, 13, 18, 14, 5, 2, 6, 7)
- Cycle 3: (3, 18, 14, 5, 2, 6, 11, 8, 15, 4, 19, 16, 0, 1, 10, 13, 9, 3)
- Cycle 4: (0, 1, 10, 19, 16, 12, 17, 11, 6, 7, 3, 9, 13, 18, 3, 7)
- Cycle 5: (14, 18, 13, 10, 19, 4, 5, 2, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <1, (4, 15), 0, 16>
- <7, (11, 8), 15, 1>
- <3, (6, 2), 11, 8>
- <0, (17, 12), 16, 1>
- <14, (5, 2), 18, 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [5].
