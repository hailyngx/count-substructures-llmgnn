Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 0) (15, 13) (15, 12) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 10) (27, 8) (2, 20) (2, 28) (2, 21) (29, 6) (29, 18) (14, 17) (14, 22) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 26) (6, 29) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 7) (18, 29) (18, 22) (18, 24) (22, 14) (22, 18) (22, 21) (1, 26) (1, 13) (26, 17) (26, 1) (26, 5) (26, 25) (5, 26) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 14) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 13) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 25) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 8) (11, 13) (11, 4) (23, 4) (3, 6) (3, 28) (3, 20) (28, 2) (28, 3) (28, 0) (24, 15) (24, 17) (24, 6) (24, 18) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 21) (21, 2) (21, 22) (21, 0) (20, 2) (20, 3) (4, 11) (4, 23) (4, 10) (10, 27) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 4) (16, 9) (8, 27) (8, 25) (8, 12) (13, 15) (13, 1) (13, 19) (13, 11) (12, 15) (12, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 17-24-6-29-18-22-14-17
        - Cycle 2: 26-17-24-6-29-18-22-21-26
        - Cycle 3: 26-17-24-6-9-10-19-26
        - Cycle 4: 26-5-7-25-8-27-15-13-26
        - Cycle 5: 26-5-7-9-10-19-13-11-26
        - Cycle 6: 26-1-13-15-27-10-9-6-24-17-26
        - Cycle 7: 26-1-13-19-14-22-21-0-28-3-20-2-26
        - Cycle 8: 26-1-13-19-10-4-11-26
        - Cycle 9: 26-1-13-19-10-27-15-0-21-22-14-17-24-26
        - Cycle 10: 26-25-7-9-6-3-28-0-21-22-14-19-26

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycle <1, 13, 15, 27, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There is [1] unique chordal 4-cycle found.
