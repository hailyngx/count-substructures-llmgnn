Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. (1, 9, 5, 6, 1)
2. (1, 6, 3, 8, 1)
3. (1, 3, 8, 5, 1)
4. (1, 5, 7, 9, 1)
5. (1, 9, 4, 1)
6. (3, 1, 9, 4, 3)
7. (3, 6, 1, 9, 3)
8. (3, 8, 5, 7, 3)
9. (3, 7, 1, 6, 3)
10. (5, 7, 9, 8, 5)
11. (5, 8, 3, 6, 5)
12. (5, 6, 1, 9, 5)
13. (6, 5, 8, 3, 6)
14. (6, 3, 1, 9, 6)
15. (7, 5, 8, 3, 7)
16. (7, 1, 9, 4, 7)
17. (8, 3, 6, 0, 8)
18. (8, 5, 9, 1, 8)
19. (9, 5, 2, 6, 9)
20. (9, 4, 1, 7, 9)

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. <1, (9, 7), 5, 6 (chord: 7)>
2. <3, (8, 5), 7, 1 (chord: 5)>
3. <5, (7, 9), 8, 3 (chord: 9)>
4. <7, (1, 9), 4, 3 (chord: 9)>

Step 3:
Final count of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <1, (9, 7), 5, 6 (chord: 7)>
2. <3, (8, 5), 7, 1 (chord: 5)>
3. <5, (7, 9), 8, 3 (chord: 9)>
4. <7, (1, 9), 4, 3 (chord: 9)>
