Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <4, 7, 5, 4>
2. Cycle <4, 6, 1, 5, 4>
3. Cycle <4, 6, 0, 9, 4>
4. Cycle <4, 9, 2, 8, 5, 4>
5. Cycle <4, 9, 0, 6, 1, 5, 4>
6. Cycle <7, 5, 8, 9, 4, 7>
7. Cycle <7, 9, 8, 5, 1, 6, 4, 7>
8. Cycle <6, 0, 2, 9, 8, 5, 1, 6>
9. Cycle <6, 1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 9, 6>
10. Cycle <9, 0, 2, 8, 5, 1, 6, 4, 9>
11. Cycle <5, 8, 2, 0, 6, 3, 5>
12. Cycle <5, 1, 6, 3, 5>
13. Cycle <4, 7, 9, 0, 2, 8, 5, 4>
14. Cycle <4, 9, 8, 6, 0, 1, 5, 4>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. <4, 6, 1, 5, 4> has chord (6, 1)
2. <4, 6, 0, 9, 4> has chord (6, 9)
3. <4, 9, 2, 8, 5, 4> has chord (9, 8)
4. <4, 9, 0, 6, 1, 5, 4> has chord (9, 1)
5. <7, 9, 8, 5, 1, 6, 4, 7> has chord (9, 5)
6. <6, 0, 2, 9, 8, 5, 1, 6> has chord (0, 9)
7. <6, 1, 5, 8, 2, 0, 9, 6> has chord (1, 8)
8. <9, 0, 2, 8, 5, 1, 6, 4, 9> has chord (0, 5)
9. <5, 8, 2, 0, 6, 3, 5> has chord (8, 0)
10. <5, 1, 6, 3, 5> has chord (1, 3)
11. <4, 7, 9, 0, 2, 8, 5, 4> has chord (7, 5)
12. <4, 9, 8, 6, 0, 1, 5, 4> has chord (9, 1)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <4, 7, 5, 4>
2. <4, 9, 2, 8, 5, 4>
