Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 0) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 13) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 12, 6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (4, 1, 9, 11, 4)
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 2, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 10, 7, 13, 5)
- Cycle 5: (6, 3, 0, 8, 6)
- Cycle 6: (7, 10, 12, 6, 7)
- Cycle 7: (9, 1, 0, 8, 9)
- Cycle 8: (13, 7, 12, 3, 13)
- Cycle 9: (14, 6, 12, 7, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (10, 13).
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (0, 3).
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (10, 12).
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (0, 1).
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (3, 12).
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (6, 12).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph because all cycles have at least one chord.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
