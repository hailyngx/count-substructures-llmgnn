Step 2:
Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, 25, 0, 21> (Chord: 0-21)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <9, 6, 8, 25> (Chord: 6-25)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <23, 22, 19, 25> (Chord: 22-25)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <26, 1, 10, 22> (Chord: 1-22)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <23, 19, 16, 27> (Chord: 19-27)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <20, 18, 28, 0> (Chord: 18-0)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, 24, 14, 23> (Chord: 24-14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <2, 17, 25, 0> (Chord: 17-0)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <7, 13, 21, 4> (Chord: 13-4)
