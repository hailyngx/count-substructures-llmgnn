Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 5) (17, 21) (1, 28) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 27) (3, 25) (3, 0) (3, 16) (25, 3) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 22) (8, 23) (8, 21) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 18) (23, 10) (28, 17) (28, 1) (29, 5) (29, 24) (22, 25) (22, 11) (22, 12) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 27) (11, 23) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 2) (19, 11) (19, 4) (19, 20) (19, 9) (27, 1) (27, 13) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 5) (16, 3) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 20) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 2) (6, 14) (6, 25) (6, 18) (24, 29) (24, 10) (0, 3) (15, 9) (15, 18) (18, 23) (18, 11) (18, 6) (18, 15) (20, 19) (20, 16) (21, 17) (21, 8) (21, 2) (9, 19) (9, 16) (9, 15) (12, 1) (12, 22) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 21) (10, 23) (10, 4) (10, 24) (10, 12) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 29) (5, 7) 

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is:

<11, (4, 20), 19)>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles in the graph is [1].
