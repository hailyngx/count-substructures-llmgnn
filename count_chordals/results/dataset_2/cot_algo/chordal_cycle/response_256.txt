Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-7-5-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-7-4-8-0
- Cycle 3: 0-7-5-2-0
- Cycle 4: 1-7-5-2-1
- Cycle 5: 2-8-6-5-2
- Cycle 6: 2-8-4-9-2
- Cycle 7: 3-8-4-9-3
- Cycle 8: 3-8-2-5-3
- Cycle 9: 4-8-2-9-4
- Cycle 10: 6-8-4-9-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, (7, 4), 8, 5>
- <0, (7, 1), 5, 2>
- <2, (8, 6), 5, 6>
- <2, (8, 4), 9, 2>
- <3, (8, 4), 9, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [5] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
