Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
    
    - Cycle 1: (6, 7, 5, 4, 6)
    - Cycle 2: (9, 0, 1, 2, 9)
    - Cycle 3: (4, 8, 5, 7, 4)
    - Cycle 4: (8, 3, 4, 7, 8)
    - Cycle 5: (0, 1, 6, 7, 0)
    - Cycle 6: (1, 2, 7, 6, 1)
    - Cycle 7: (3, 0, 9, 2, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

    - Cycle 1: (6, 5, 7, 4, 6) - Chord: (5, 4)
    - Cycle 2: (9, 0, 1, 2, 9) - Chord: (0, 1)
    - Cycle 3: (4, 8, 5, 7, 4) - Chord: (8, 7)
    - Cycle 4: (8, 3, 4, 7, 8) - Chord: (3, 7)
    - Cycle 5: (0, 1, 6, 7, 0) - Chord: (1, 6)
    - Cycle 6: (1, 2, 7, 6, 1) - Chord: (2, 6)
    - Cycle 7: (3, 0, 9, 2, 3) - Chord: (0, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

    - There are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final result is [7]. The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
    
    <6, 5, 7, 4, (5, 4)>
    <9, 0, 1, 2, (0, 1)>
    <4, 8, 5, 7, (8, 7)>
    <8, 3, 4, 7, (3, 7)>
    <0, 1, 6, 7, (1, 6)>
    <1, 2, 7, 6, (2, 6)>
    <3, 0, 9, 2, (0, 9)>
