- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (21, 20), 23> (Chord: (21, 20))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (25, 23), 20> (Chord: (25, 23))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (19, 26), 18> (Chord: (19, 26))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (12, 2), 13> (Chord: (12, 2))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (12, 6), 26> (Chord: (12, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <21, (20, 25), 23> (Chord: (20, 25))
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <14, (17, 15), 5> (Chord: (17, 15))
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <14, (17, 10), 9> (Chord: (17, 10))
