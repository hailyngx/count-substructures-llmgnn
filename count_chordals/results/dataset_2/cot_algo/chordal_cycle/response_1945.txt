Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5,9,7,4> has a chord (7,4)
- <5,9,12,13> has a chord (9,12)
- <5,9,12,14> has a chord (9,12)
- <5,9,7,11> has a chord (7,11)
- <5,9,10,11> has a chord (9,10)
- <5,9,3,2> has a chord (9,3)
- <5,9,3,6> has a chord (9,3) 
   and so on...

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [15]
