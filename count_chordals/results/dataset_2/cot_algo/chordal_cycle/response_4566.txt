Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 4, 1, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 8, 5, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 1, 4, 9, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 1, 2, 5, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 2, 5, 8, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 5, 1, 2, 6)
- Cycle 7: (9, 6, 5, 8, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 6, 2, 1, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 8, 4, 1, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 8, 5, 6, 9)
- Cycle 11: (1, 6, 2, 3, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 6, 5, 8, 1)
- Cycle 13: (1, 2, 3, 4, 1)
- Cycle 14: (1, 2, 5, 8, 1)
- Cycle 15: (3, 0, 4, 9, 3)
- Cycle 16: (3, 0, 8, 5, 3)
- Cycle 17: (4, 9, 8, 0, 4)
- Cycle 18: (4, 9, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 19: (4, 1, 2, 3, 4)
- Cycle 20: (4, 1, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 21: (7, 6, 1, 2, 7)
- Cycle 22: (8, 9, 4, 0, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- (6, 1, 4, 9, 6) has one chord: (1, 9)
- (6, 1, 2, 5, 6) has one chord: (1, 5)
- (6, 2, 5, 8, 6) has one chord: (2, 8)
- (1, 6, 2, 3, 1) has one chord: (6, 3)
- (4, 9, 6, 1, 4) has one chord: (9, 1)
- (7, 6, 1, 2, 7) has one chord: (6, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final count is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<6, (1, 9)>
<6, (1, 5)>
<6, (2, 8)>
<1, (6, 3)>
<4, (9, 1)>
<7, (6, 2)>
