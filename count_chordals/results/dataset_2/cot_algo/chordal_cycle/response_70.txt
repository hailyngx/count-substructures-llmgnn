Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 14) (27, 15) (20, 25) (20, 8) (20, 13) (20, 9) (25, 20) (25, 18) (25, 11) (10, 16) (10, 14) (11, 25) (11, 21) (8, 20) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (23, 8) (23, 0) (23, 13) (23, 28) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 25) (18, 21) (2, 8) (2, 5) (22, 3) (26, 24) (26, 16) (28, 23) (28, 14) (28, 19) (28, 13) (1, 12) (17, 4) (17, 24) (17, 19) (24, 26) (24, 17) (24, 7) (24, 9) (24, 5) (0, 8) (0, 23) (7, 24) (7, 3) (9, 20) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 21) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (16, 10) (16, 26) (16, 29) (16, 3) (3, 22) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 16) (3, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 24) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 28) (19, 28) (19, 17) (6, 3) (6, 29) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 6) (29, 21) (21, 11) (21, 18) (21, 9) (21, 29) (13, 20) (13, 23) (13, 4) (13, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (15, 27, 20, 25, 15)
- Cycle 2: (15, 27, 20, 8, 15)
- Cycle 3: (15, 27, 20, 9, 15)
- Cycle 4: (15, 29, 16, 26, 24, 17, 19, 28, 13, 4, 15)
- Cycle 5: (15, 29, 6, 3, 12, 1, 12, 4, 13, 28, 19, 17, 24, 26, 16, 29)
- Cycle 6: (15, 14, 10, 16, 26, 24, 5, 2, 8, 0, 23, 28, 19, 17, 24, 7, 3, 6, 29, 21, 11, 25, 18, 21, 9, 20, 13, 4, 5, 24, 9, 21, 29, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <Cycle 1, (27, 20)> - Not a chordal 4-cycle
- <Cycle 2, (27, 8)> - Not a chordal 4-cycle
- <Cycle 3, (27, 9)> - Not a chordal 4-cycle
- <Cycle 4, (15, 24)> - Not a chordal 4-cycle
- <Cycle 5, (29, 13)> - Not a chordal 4-cycle
- <Cycle 6, (15, 21)> - Not a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are no chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph, so the final answer is [0].
