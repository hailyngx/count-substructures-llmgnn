Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 12) (26, 20) (26, 25) (18, 24) (18, 28) (18, 13) (22, 17) (22, 29) (22, 7) (22, 21) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 15) (0, 11) (0, 5) (20, 26) (20, 12) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 16) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 21) (21, 22) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 16) (21, 14) (14, 21) (13, 18) (13, 10) (1, 25) (1, 19) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 17) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 5) (4, 9) (4, 27) (4, 23) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 3) (27, 5) (29, 22) (29, 23) (29, 3) (16, 6) (16, 21) (16, 3) (7, 22) (7, 23) (7, 17) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 27) (5, 12) (2, 27) (24, 18) (24, 12) (19, 1) (19, 23) (25, 26) (25, 1) (12, 9) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 24) (12, 17) (3, 10) (3, 27) (3, 29) (3, 16) (23, 4) (23, 29) (23, 7) (23, 19) (17, 22) (17, 15) (17, 7) (17, 12) 

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is <0, 11, 15, 8>.

Since this 4-cycle has one chord (the edge between nodes 15 and 8), the final answer is [1].
