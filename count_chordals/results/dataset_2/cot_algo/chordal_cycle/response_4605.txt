Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 3, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 6, 4, 5, 9)
- Cycle 3: (6, 4, 0, 8, 6)
- Cycle 4: (1, 7, 3, 2, 1)
- Cycle 5: (7, 8, 0, 4, 7)
- Cycle 6: (8, 0, 6, 9, 8)
- Cycle 7: (0, 4, 6, 9, 0)
- Cycle 8: (2, 3, 6, 9, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has chord (3, 6) connecting non-adjacent nodes 3 and 6.
- Cycle 2 has chord (6, 9) connecting non-adjacent nodes 6 and 9.
- Cycle 3 has chord (4, 8) connecting non-adjacent nodes 4 and 8.
- Cycle 4 has chord (7, 2) connecting non-adjacent nodes 7 and 2.
- Cycle 5 has chord (8, 4) connecting non-adjacent nodes 8 and 4.
- Cycle 6 has chord (0, 9) connecting non-adjacent nodes 0 and 9.
- Cycle 7 has chord (4, 6) connecting non-adjacent nodes 4 and 6.
- Cycle 8 has chord (3, 9) connecting non-adjacent nodes 3 and 9.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found.

Final answer: [8]
List of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (3, 6), 5)>
<2, (6, 9), 5)>
<3, (4, 8), 6)>
<4, (7, 2), 1)>
<5, (8, 4), 7)>
<6, (0, 9), 8)>
<7, (4, 6), 0)>
<8, (3, 9), 2)>
