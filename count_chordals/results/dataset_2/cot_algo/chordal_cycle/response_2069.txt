Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 14) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 2) (5, 4) (5, 13) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 14) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 3) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- (1, 6, 13, 10, 1)
- (1, 6, 13, 4, 1)
- (1, 7, 2, 12, 8, 0, 4, 13, 7, 1)
- (1, 10, 13, 5, 4, 11, 14, 2, 7, 1)
- (3, 9, 10, 1, 7, 13, 4, 0, 8, 3)
- (4, 0, 6, 13, 5, 13, 7, 2, 12, 8, 0)
- (8, 12, 2, 1, 14, 11, 4, 0, 8)
- (10, 1, 6, 0, 8, 12, 2, 7, 13, 10)

Step 2: 
Chordal 4-cycles: 
- <1, 6, 13, 10, 1>
- <1, 6, 13, 4, 1>
- <3, 9, 10, 1, 7, 13, 4, 0, 8, 3>
- <10, 1, 6, 0, 8, 12, 2, 7, 13, 10>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [4]
