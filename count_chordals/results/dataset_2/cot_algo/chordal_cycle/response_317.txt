Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 23) (26, 15) (26, 17) (15, 26) (15, 27) (27, 15) (27, 18) (27, 28) (27, 7) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (20, 18) (20, 19) (20, 24) (25, 13) (25, 19) (25, 11) (2, 22) (2, 5) (2, 24) (2, 28) (8, 14) (8, 22) (17, 26) (17, 5) (17, 21) (29, 7) (29, 10) (1, 28) (1, 12) (19, 20) (19, 25) (19, 23) (23, 9) (23, 19) (23, 18) (0, 16) (0, 5) (16, 0) (16, 10) (22, 2) (22, 8) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 0) (7, 27) (7, 29) (7, 28) (14, 8) (14, 24) (14, 10) (3, 9) (3, 24) (3, 18) (24, 20) (24, 2) (24, 14) (24, 3) (24, 4) (18, 27) (18, 20) (18, 23) (18, 3) (18, 28) (13, 6) (13, 25) (13, 4) (12, 6) (12, 1) (10, 29) (10, 16) (10, 14) (4, 6) (4, 24) (4, 13) (4, 11) (11, 25) (11, 4) (11, 21) (28, 27) (28, 2) (28, 1) (28, 7) (28, 18) (21, 17) (21, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (9, 6, 4, 24, 3, 18, 27, 15, 26, 17, 5, 2, 22, 8, 14, 10, 29, 7)
- Cycle 2: (9, 6, 4, 24, 2, 5, 0, 16, 10, 14, 8, 22, 2, 24, 3, 18)
- Cycle 3: (9, 6, 4, 24, 14, 8, 22, 2, 5, 17, 26, 15, 27, 7, 29, 10, 16)
- Cycle 4: (26, 15, 27, 7, 29, 10, 16, 0, 5, 17, 21, 11, 25, 19, 20, 24, 3)
- Cycle 5: (15, 27, 7, 29, 10, 14, 8, 22, 2, 5, 0, 16, 10, 29, 7, 28, 1)
- Cycle 6: (27, 7, 29, 10, 16, 0, 5, 2, 24, 20, 19, 23, 9, 6, 4, 24, 3)
- Cycle 7: (6, 4, 24, 20, 19, 25, 11, 21, 17, 26, 15, 27, 7, 29, 10, 16, 0) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 has chord (15, 7): <1, (15, 7), 1)>
- Cycle 2 has no chords
- Cycle 3 has chord (26, 2): <2, (26, 2), 3)>
- Cycle 4 has chord (15, 14): <4, (15, 14), 5)>
- Cycle 5 has chord (27, 1): <6, (27, 1), 7)>
- Cycle 6 has chord (27, 9): <8, (27, 9), 9)>
- Cycle 7 has chord (19, 16): <10, (19, 16), 11)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:

- <1, (15, 7), 1>
- <2, (26, 2), 3>
- <4, (15, 14), 5>
- <6, (27, 1), 7>
- <8, (27, 9), 9>
- <10, (19, 16), 11>
