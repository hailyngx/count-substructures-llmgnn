Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-4-7-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-9-8-6-0
- Cycle 3: 0-9-3-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-1-7-6-0
- Cycle 5: 0-1-3-2-0
- Cycle 6: 1-5-7-6-1
- Cycle 7: 1-5-3-2-1
- Cycle 8: 1-7-4-9-1
- Cycle 9: 1-7-2-3-1
- Cycle 10: 3-2-7-6-3
- Cycle 11: 4-9-3-2-4
- Cycle 12: 4-9-8-6-4
- Cycle 13: 4-7-2-3-4
- Cycle 14: 6-7-2-3-6
- Cycle 15: 8-9-3-2-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 2, 6, 8> has one chord: (6, 8)
- <0, 2, 3, 4> has one chord: (2, 4)
- <0, 1, 9, 4> has one chord: (1, 9)
- <1, 3, 6, 7> has one chord: (3, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 11 chordless 4-cycles found.

Thus, the final result is [11].
