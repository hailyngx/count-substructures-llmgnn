Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 22) (11, 20) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 22) (15, 26) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 14) (27, 13) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 24) (6, 9) (6, 22) (10, 26) (10, 19) (0, 20) (0, 28) (0, 8) (0, 26) (0, 19) (20, 11) (20, 0) (7, 25) (12, 16) (12, 21) (12, 18) (24, 9) (24, 26) (24, 8) (24, 13) (24, 28) (26, 15) (26, 10) (26, 0) (26, 24) (19, 5) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 17) (25, 15) (25, 7) (25, 17) (25, 1) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 25) (17, 28) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 21) (2, 4) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 17) (18, 12) (18, 14) (18, 21) (23, 21) (23, 29) (29, 15) (29, 23) (8, 0) (8, 24) (1, 5) (1, 25) (1, 4) (21, 12) (21, 2) (21, 18) (21, 23) (14, 27) (14, 18) (14, 13) (22, 11) (22, 16) (22, 6) (13, 27) (13, 24) (13, 2) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 2-5-9-6
- Cycle 2: 5-9-24-26
- Cycle 3: 5-9-24-28
- Cycle 4: 9-24-28-0
- Cycle 5: 24-28-17-19
- Cycle 6: 24-26-15-25
- Cycle 7: 26-15-25-17
- Cycle 8: 15-25-7-27

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (9, 26)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (9, 28)
- Cycle 4 has two chords: (24, 28) and (9, 26)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (24, 19)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (15, 25)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (26, 25)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (15, 27)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <2, 5, 9, 6> (chord: (9, 26))
2. <5, 9, 24, 26> (chord: (9, 26))
3. <5, 9, 24, 28> (chord: (9, 28))
4. <24, 28, 17, 19> (chord: (24, 19))
5. <15, 25, 7, 27> (chord: (15, 27))
