Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle: 0-1-2-7-0 (chord 2-7)
2. Cycle: 0-1-6-9-0 (chord 1-9)
3. Cycle: 0-1-2-8-0 (chord 2-8)
4. Cycle: 0-1-6-7-0 (chord 1-7)
5. Cycle: 0-3-5-7-0 (chord 3-7)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 0-1-2-7-0 has one chord (2-7)
- Cycle 0-1-6-9-0 has one chord (1-9)
- Cycle 0-1-2-8-0 has one chord (2-8)
- Cycle 0-1-6-7-0 has one chord (1-7)
- Cycle 0-3-5-7-0 has no chord 

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 1, 2, 7> with chord (2, 7)
<0, 1, 6, 9> with chord (1, 9)
<0, 1, 2, 8> with chord (2, 8)
<0, 1, 6, 7> with chord (1, 7)
