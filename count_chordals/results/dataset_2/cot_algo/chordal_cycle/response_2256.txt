Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 3) (16, 9) (10, 18) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 7) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (19, 5) (19, 7) (15, 8) (15, 0) (15, 4) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 7) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (18, 10) (18, 1) (3, 16) (3, 6) (7, 13) (7, 19) (7, 17) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 7) (14, 5) (14, 9) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 9) (4, 1) (0, 11) (0, 15) (0, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 0) (1, 18) (1, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-15-8-12-0
- Cycle 2: 1-4-9-14-5-2-17-7-13-8-12-0-15-4-1
- Cycle 3: 2-9-4-1
- Cycle 4: 3-16-9-4
- Cycle 5: 4-1-18-10-5
- Cycle 6: 5-14-9-4
- Cycle 7: 6-5-14-9
- Cycle 8: 7-13-8-15
- Cycle 9: 8-15-0-11
- Cycle 10: 9-16-13-17
- Cycle 11: 10-18-1-4
- Cycle 12: 12-8-13-17

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, 15, 8, 12>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 9, 14>
- Cycle 3: <4, 1, 9, 2>
- Cycle 4: <16, 9, 4, 3>
- Cycle 5: <1, 18, 10, 5>
- Cycle 6: <5, 9, 4, 14>
- Cycle 7: <5, 14, 9, 6>
- Cycle 8: <8, 15, 13, 7>
- Cycle 9: <0, 11, 15, 8>
- Cycle 10: <9, 16, 13, 17>
- Cycle 11: <1, 4, 13, 17>
- Resulting chordal 4-cycles: [<0>, <11>, <3>, <6>, <7>, <12>]

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [6].
