Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-9-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-2-5-0
- Cycle 3: 1-7-5-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-7-2-8-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-9-8-1
- Cycle 6: 2-5-7-1-2
- Cycle 7: 2-5-0-3-2
- Cycle 8: 2-4-9-8-2
- Cycle 9: 2-4-0-5-2
- Cycle 10: 3-5-7-1-3
- Cycle 11: 3-0-5-2-3
- Cycle 12: 3-8-2-7-3
- Cycle 13: 4-9-8-6-4
- Cycle 14: 4-9-6-1-4
- Cycle 15: 4-6-1-7-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-9-8-1 (Chord: 6-8)
- Cycle 2: 2-4-9-8-2 (Chord: 4-9)
- Cycle 3: 2-5-7-1-2 (Chord: 5-7)
- Cycle 4: 1-7-2-8-1 (Chord: 2-7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 6, 9, 8, 1> with chord (6, 8)
- <2, 4, 9, 8, 2> with chord (4, 9)
- <2, 5, 7, 1, 2> with chord (5, 7)
- <1, 7, 2, 8, 1> with chord (2, 7)
