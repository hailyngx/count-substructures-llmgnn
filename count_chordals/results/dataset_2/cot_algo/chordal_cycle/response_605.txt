Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 7) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 14) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 13) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-11-2-5
- Cycle 2: 5-2-12-5
- Cycle 3: 5-2-14-5
- Cycle 4: 5-14-2-5
- Cycle 5: 5-3-12-5
- Cycle 6: 5-3-9-12-5
- Cycle 7: 5-3-12-2-5
- Cycle 8: 5-12-2-5
- Cycle 9: 11-2-5-11
- Cycle 10: 11-5-14-2-11
- Cycle 11: 11-5-14-7-6-11
- Cycle 12: 11-5-14-4-2-11
- Cycle 13: 11-5-14-4-13-10-11
- Cycle 14: 11-5-2-12-3-6-11
- Cycle 15: 11-5-2-12-9-13-10-11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<1, (2, 5)>
<2, (12, 5)>
<3, (14, 5)>
<4, (2, 5)>
<5, (3, 5)>
<6, (5, 12)>
<7, (3, 12)>
<8, (2, 5)>
<9, (2, 11)>
<10, (14, 5)>
<11, (14, 7)>
<12, (14, 2)>
<13, (10, 11)>
<14, (2, 12)>
<15, (12, 9)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [15]
