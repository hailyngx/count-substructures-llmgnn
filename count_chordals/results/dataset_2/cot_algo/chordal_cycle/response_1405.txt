Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 16) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (0, 17) (0, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (15, 10) (15, 2) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 16) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 9) (18, 14) (18, 19) (18, 16) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 6) (2, 15) (2, 12) (2, 19) (2, 6) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 2) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 18) (16, 9) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (9, 16) 

Response:
Following the steps provided:

Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 11, 10, 9, 12, 2, 15, 10, 3, 1, 0)
- Cycle 2: (2, 12, 9, 10, 15, 2)
- Cycle 3: (3, 16, 18, 14, 9, 12, 4, 16, 3)
- Cycle 4: (4, 19, 18, 16, 3, 1, 11, 10, 9, 12, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 8, 7, 3, 16, 18, 19, 6, 17, 14, 9, 10, 11, 1, 0, 17, 6, 5)
- Cycle 6: (6, 19, 18, 14, 17, 6)
- Cycle 7: (7, 3, 1, 0, 17, 6, 2, 15, 10, 11, 1, 7)
- Cycle 8: (8, 13, 5, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 11, 10, 9, 12, 2, 15, 10, 3, 1, 0) -> Chord: (10, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 12, 9, 10, 15, 2) -> Chord: (9, 10)
- Cycle 3: (3, 16, 18, 14, 9, 12, 4, 16, 3) -> Chord: (14, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 19, 18, 16, 3, 1, 11, 10, 9, 12, 4) -> Chord: (16, 9)
- Cycle 5: (5, 8, 7, 3, 16, 18, 19, 6, 17, 14, 9, 10, 11, 1, 0, 17, 6, 5) -> Chord: (18, 11)
- Cycle 6: (6, 19, 18, 14, 17, 6) -> Chord: (18, 17)
- Cycle 7: (7, 3, 1, 0, 17, 6, 2, 15, 10, 11, 1, 7) -> Chord: (3, 10)
- Cycle 8: (8, 13, 5, 8) -> Chord: (5, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
