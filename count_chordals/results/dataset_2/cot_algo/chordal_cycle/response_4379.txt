Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (22, 13) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 17) (22, 8) (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 14) (16, 20) (14, 16) (14, 9) (17, 22) (17, 19) (7, 21) (7, 25) (7, 23) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 19) (21, 25) (15, 20) (15, 18) (15, 28) (6, 9) (6, 25) (6, 18) (6, 23) (6, 20) (9, 22) (9, 14) (9, 6) (9, 29) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 19) (20, 16) (20, 15) (20, 6) (20, 8) (4, 29) (4, 2) (18, 15) (18, 6) (18, 19) (18, 0) (19, 17) (19, 21) (19, 12) (19, 18) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 5) (26, 0) (3, 21) (25, 7) (25, 21) (25, 6) (25, 28) (29, 9) (29, 4) (29, 1) (29, 10) (2, 22) (2, 4) (2, 10) (5, 26) (5, 23) (5, 24) (5, 0) (8, 22) (8, 20) (8, 28) (28, 15) (28, 25) (28, 8) (24, 5) (1, 12) (1, 29) (1, 0) (23, 7) (23, 6) (23, 5) (0, 18) (0, 26) (0, 5) (0, 1) (10, 12) (10, 29) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle C1: {21, 7, 25, 6, 21}
- Cycle C2: {16, 20, 6, 9, 16}
- Cycle C3: {16, 20, 8, 22, 16}
- Cycle C4: {26, 19, 18, 15, 26}
- Cycle C5: {29, 9, 6, 25, 29}
- Cycle C6: {1, 12, 10, 29, 1}
- Cycle C7: {2, 22, 8, 20, 2}
- Cycle C8: {4, 29, 1, 0, 4}
- Cycle C9: {5, 26, 19, 12, 5}
- Cycle C10: {6, 25, 7, 21, 6}

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle C1: {21, 7, 25, 6, 21} has a chord {7, 6}
- Cycle C2: {16, 20, 6, 9, 16} has a chord {20, 9}
- Cycle C3: {16, 20, 8, 22, 16} has a chord {20, 22}
- Cycle C4: {26, 19, 18, 15, 26} has a chord {19, 15}
- Cycle C5: {29, 9, 6, 25, 29} has a chord {9, 25}
- Cycle C6: {1, 12, 10, 29, 1} has a chord {12, 29}
- Cycle C7: {2, 22, 8, 20, 2} has a chord {22, 20}
- Cycle C8: {4, 29, 1, 0, 4} has a chord {29, 0}
- Cycle C9: {5, 26, 19, 12, 5} has a chord {26, 12}
- Cycle C10: {6, 25, 7, 21, 6} has a chord {25, 21}

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <>
There are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
