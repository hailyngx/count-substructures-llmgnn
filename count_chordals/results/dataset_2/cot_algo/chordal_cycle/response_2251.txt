Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle <0, 6, 3, 2, 0>
2. Cycle <4, 7, 3, 6, 4>
3. Cycle <5, 9, 8, 3, 5>
4. Cycle <7, 0, 5, 1, 7>
5. Cycle <9, 5, 7, 4, 9>
6. Cycle <6, 3, 7, 4, 6>
7. Cycle <2, 3, 8, 9, 2>
8. Cycle <8, 9, 6, 0, 8>

Step 2: Checking for a single chord in each cycle:

1. Cycle <0, 6, 3, 2, 0> - Chord <3, 6>
2. Cycle <4, 7, 3, 6, 4> - Chord <3, 6>
3. Cycle <5, 9, 8, 3, 5> - Chord <8, 9>
4. Cycle <7, 0, 5, 1, 7> - Chord <0, 5>
5. Cycle <9, 5, 7, 4, 9> - Chord <5, 4>
6. Cycle <6, 3, 7, 4, 6> - Chord <3, 4>
7. Cycle <2, 3, 8, 9, 2> - Chord <3, 8>
8. Cycle <8, 9, 6, 0, 8> - Chord <9, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 6, 3, 2> with chord (3, 6)
- <4, 7, 3, 6> with chord (3, 6)
- <5, 9, 8, 3> with chord (8, 9)
- <7, 0, 5, 1> with chord (0, 5)
- <9, 5, 7, 4> with chord (5, 4)
- <6, 3, 7, 4> with chord (3, 4)
- <2, 3, 8, 9> with chord (3, 8)
- <8, 9, 6, 0> with chord (9, 6)
