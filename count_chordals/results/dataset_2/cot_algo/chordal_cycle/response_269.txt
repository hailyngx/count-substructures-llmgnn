Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 7) (15, 17) (15, 16) (27, 4) (27, 9) (27, 5) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 7) (3, 20) (25, 3) (25, 19) (8, 23) (8, 28) (23, 8) (23, 21) (23, 19) (28, 3) (28, 8) (28, 29) (28, 14) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 12) (29, 14) (29, 21) (4, 27) (4, 18) (4, 16) (4, 20) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 12) (18, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (17, 15) (2, 19) (2, 7) (22, 11) (0, 13) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 24) (1, 18) (6, 13) (6, 26) (9, 27) (9, 18) (9, 21) (9, 7) (7, 15) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 24) (24, 16) (24, 7) (11, 22) (11, 19) (11, 5) (19, 25) (19, 23) (19, 2) (19, 11) (19, 10) (20, 3) (20, 4) (20, 14) (20, 10) (21, 23) (21, 29) (21, 9) (21, 26) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 21) (26, 12) (5, 27) (5, 11) (5, 12) (12, 29) (12, 18) (12, 26) (12, 5) (14, 28) (14, 29) (14, 20) (10, 19) (10, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <15, 7, 3, 25, 15>
- Cycle 2: <27, 4, 18, 9, 27>
- Cycle 3: <3, 25, 19, 23, 3>
- Cycle 4: <8, 23, 19, 28, 8>
- Cycle 5: <23, 19, 2, 7, 23>
- Cycle 6: <28, 3, 20, 14, 28>
- Cycle 7: <29, 28, 8, 23, 29>
- Cycle 8: <4, 27, 5, 11, 4>
- Cycle 9: <18, 4, 20, 10, 18>
- Cycle 10: <13, 0, 6, 26, 13>
- Cycle 11: <17, 15, 7, 2, 17>
- Cycle 12: <19, 25, 3, 7, 19>
- Cycle 13: <21, 9, 18, 12, 21>
- Cycle 14: <24, 16, 4, 27, 24>
- Cycle 15: <11, 22, 19, 2, 11>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has two chords: Chord (3, 25)
- Cycle 2 has two chords: Chord (4, 18)
- Cycle 3 has two chords: Chord (25, 19)
- Cycle 4 has two chords: Chord (19, 23)
- Cycle 5 has two chords: Chord (19, 2)
- Cycle 6 has two chords: Chord (3, 20)
- Cycle 7 has two chords: Chord (8, 23)
- Cycle 8 has two chords: Chord (4, 27)
- Cycle 9 has two chords: Chord (4, 20)
- Cycle 10 has two chords: Chord (0, 6)
- Cycle 11 has two chords: Chord (15, 7)
- Cycle 12 has two chords: Chord (3, 7)
- Cycle 13 has two chords: Chord (9, 18)
- Cycle 14 has two chords: Chord (16, 4)
- Cycle 15 has two chords: Chord (19, 2)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
As each cycle has two chords, none of the cycles are chordal 4-cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
