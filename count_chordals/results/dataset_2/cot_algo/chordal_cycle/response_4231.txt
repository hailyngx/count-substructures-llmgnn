Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 0) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 16) (3, 13) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 15) (17, 0) (17, 18) (10, 15) (10, 14) (15, 7) (15, 10) (15, 12) (13, 3) (13, 11) (8, 6) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 11) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 14) (18, 5) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 0) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 14) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 19) (14, 11) (12, 15) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 17) (0, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-7-4
- Cycle 2: 9-14-11-2-1
- Cycle 3: 15-7-4-11-13
- Cycle 4: 15-12-16-3-13
- Cycle 5: 8-6-9-14-10
- Cycle 6: 0-1-2-11-14
- Cycle 7: 0-17-18-19-14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is:
- <5, 6, 4, 7> with chord (9, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
