Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (9, 26, 15, 25, 21, 16, 11, 23, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 26, 23, 11, 16, 21, 25, 15, 26)
- Cycle 3: (9, 26, 23, 17, 6, 19, 6, 9)
- Cycle 4: (16, 21, 25, 15, 12, 7, 12, 21, 16)
- Cycle 5: (16, 21, 12, 7, 29, 1, 4, 11, 16)
- Cycle 6: (16, 21, 12, 7, 14, 24, 18, 13, 16)
- Cycle 7: (16, 21, 12, 22, 10, 16)
- Cycle 8: (16, 11, 23, 17, 6, 19, 17, 23, 11)
- Cycle 9: (6, 17, 23, 11, 4, 1, 29, 7, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 17, 23, 26, 15, 12, 21, 25, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 17, 23, 26, 9, 6)
- Cycle 12: (21, 16, 11, 4, 1, 29, 5, 18, 21)
- Cycle 13: (21, 12, 7, 14, 24, 18, 5, 1, 21)
- Cycle 14: (21, 12, 7, 29, 27, 2, 15, 25, 21)
- Cycle 15: (21, 12, 15, 25, 21)
- Cycle 16: (23, 11, 4, 1, 29, 7, 14, 24, 23)
- Cycle 17: (23, 11, 4, 1, 29, 27, 8, 13, 23)
- Cycle 18: (23, 11, 16, 21, 25, 15, 26, 9, 23)
- Cycle 19: (23, 26, 15, 12, 7, 29, 1, 4, 23)
- Cycle 20: (23, 26, 15, 25, 21, 12, 7, 29, 23)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycles 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, and 14 each have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<9, 26, 15, 25, 21, 16, 11, 23> (Chord: 16)
<9, 26, 23, 17, 6, 19, 6, 9> (Chord: 6)
<16, 21, 12, 7, 14, 24, 18, 13, 16> (Chord: 13)
<6, 17, 23, 11, 4, 1, 29, 7, 6> (Chord: 29)
<6, 17, 23, 26, 15, 12, 21, 25, 6> (Chord: 21)
<21, 12, 7, 29, 27, 2, 15, 25, 21> (Chord: 25)
<23, 11, 16, 21, 25, 15, 26, 9, 23> (Chord: 21)
