Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
        - Cycle 1: <1, 5, 2, 7, 1> (with the edge (1,5), (5,2), (2,7), (7,1))
        - Cycle 2: <1, 5, 9, 6, 1> (with the edge (1,5), (5,9), (9,6), (6,1))
        - Cycle 3: <1, 7, 8, 4, 1> (with the edge (1,7), (7,8), (8,4), (4,1))
        - Cycle 4: <1, 3, 7, 8, 1> (with the edge (1,3), (3,7), (7,8), (8,1))
        - Cycle 5: <1, 6, 9, 8, 1> (with the edge (1,6), (6,9), (9,8), (8,1))
        - Cycle 6: <1, 2, 5, 9, 1> (with the edge (1,2), (2,5), (5,9), (9,1))
        - Cycle 7: <2, 5, 1, 7, 2> (with the edge (2,5), (5,1), (1,7), (7,2))
        - Cycle 8: <2, 7, 1, 3, 2> (with the edge (2,7), (7,1), (1,3), (3,2))
        - Cycle 9: <2, 1, 6, 9, 2> (with the edge (2,1), (1,6), (6,9), (9,2))
        - Cycle 10: <2, 3, 7, 8, 2> (with the edge (2,3), (3,7), (7,8), (8,2))
        - Cycle 11: <3, 9, 0, 4, 3> (with the edge (3,9), (9,0), (0,4), (4,3))
        - Cycle 12: <3, 7, 1, 5, 3> (with the edge (3,7), (7,1), (1,5), (5,3))
        - Cycle 13: <3, 1, 6, 2, 3> (with the edge (3,1), (1,6), (6,2), (2,3))
        - Cycle 14: <3, 0, 4, 8, 3> (with the edge (3,0), (0,4), (4,8), (8,3))
        - Cycle 15: <4, 0, 9, 6, 4> (with the edge (4,0), (0,9), (9,6), (6,4))
        - Cycle 16: <4, 8, 7, 1, 4> (with the edge (4,8), (8,7), (7,1), (1,4))
        - Cycle 17: <5, 9, 6, 1, 5> (with the edge (5,9), (9,6), (6,1), (1,5))
        - Cycle 18: <5, 1, 7, 2, 5> (with the edge (5,1), (1,7), (7,2), (2,5))
        - Cycle 19: <5, 2, 1, 6, 5> (with the edge (5,2), (2,1), (1,6), (6,5))
        
Step 2:
        - Among the cycles listed above, we can identify two chordal 4-cycles:
            - <1, 5, 2, 7, 1> with chord (5, 7)
            - <1, 6, 9, 8, 1> with chord (6, 8)
        
Step 3:
        - The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [2].
