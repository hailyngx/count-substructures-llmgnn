Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (4, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (1, 6, 5, 4, 1)
        - Cycle 2: (2, 0, 5, 3, 2)
        - Cycle 3: (3, 5, 0, 8, 3)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 5, 0, 8, 4)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 0, 8, 7, 5)
        - Cycle 6: (6, 1, 4, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 7: (7, 3, 0, 8, 7)
        - Cycle 8: (8, 0, 2, 1, 8)
        - Cycle 9: (9, 7, 8, 0, 9)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has chords (1, 5)
        - Cycle 2 has chords (0, 5)
        - Cycle 3 has chords (5, 0)
        - Cycle 4 has chords (5, 0)
        - Cycle 5 has chords (0, 5)
        - Cycle 6 has chords (1, 5)
        - Cycle 7 has chords (0, 8)
        - Cycle 8 has chords (1, 2)
        - Cycle 9 has chords (7, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are no chordless cycles in this graph. 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
