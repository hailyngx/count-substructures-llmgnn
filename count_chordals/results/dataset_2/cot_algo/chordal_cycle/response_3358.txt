Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 in the graph with all necessary edges:
- Cycle 1: (1,4,5,2,1)
- Cycle 2: (1,4,3,2,1)
- Cycle 3: (1,4,3,8,1)
- Cycle 4: (1,4,0,6,1)
- Cycle 5: (1,4,0,5,1)
  
Step 2:
Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Chord (1,5)
- Cycle 2: Chord (4,3)
- Cycle 3: Chord (4,8)
- Cycle 4: Chord (0, 6)
- Cycle 5: Chord (4, 0)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (1, 5), 5)>
<2, (4, 3), 2)>
<3, (4, 8), 3)>
<4, (0, 6), 1)>
<5, (4, 0), 5)>
