Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 1-6-4-0-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-8-7-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-5-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-9-0-1
- Cycle 5: 3-1-8-7-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 4).
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 7).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (1, 2).
- Cycle 4 has a chord (1, 9).
- Cycle 5 has a chord (8, 7).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [5].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (1, 4), 0, 6>
- <1, (1, 7), 8, 6>
- <1, (1, 2), 5, 6>
- <1, (1, 9), 6, 0>
- <3, (8, 7), 1, 3>
