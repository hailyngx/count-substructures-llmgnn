Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 0) - (0, 1) - (1, 7) - (7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7) - (7, 4) - (4, 9) - (9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 4) - (4, 7) - (7, 1) - (1, 9)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7) - (7, 3) - (3, 1) - (1, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 6) - (6, 1) - (1, 9) - (9, 4)
- Cycle 6: (7, 6) - (6, 1) - (1, 9) - (9, 7)
- Cycle 7: (1, 8) - (8, 0) - (0, 5) - (5, 1)
- Cycle 8: (3, 2) - (2, 4) - (4, 7) - (7, 3)
- Cycle 9: (2, 8) - (8, 0) - (0, 1) - (1, 2)
- Cycle 10: (0, 1) - (1, 7) - (7, 3) - (3, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- Cycle 1 <1, (3, 5), 7>
- Cycle 2 <2, (3, 7), 4>
- Cycle 3 <4, (6, 7), 9>
- Cycle 4 <6, (1, 9), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found

As only the chordal 4-cycles were found, there are [0] chordless cycles in the given graph.
