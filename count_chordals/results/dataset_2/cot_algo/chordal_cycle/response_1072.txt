Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0-6-7-9-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-2-9-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-7-9-0
- Cycle 4: 1-0-3-8-1
- Cycle 5: 1-2-7-4-1
- Cycle 6: 2-6-7-9-2
- Cycle 7: 2-6-0-1-2
- Cycle 8: 2-6-7-4-2
- Cycle 9: 3-0-1-2-3
- Cycle 10: 3-0-4-7-3
- Cycle 11: 4-7-2-9-4
- Cycle 12: 4-7-6-2-4
- Cycle 13: 5-1-7-4-5
- Cycle 14: 5-1-0-3-5
- Cycle 15: 5-3-4-7-5
- Cycle 16: 6-0-1-2-6
- Cycle 17: 7-4-3-0-7
- Cycle 18: 7-4-8-2-7
- Cycle 19: 8-3-0-4-8
- Cycle 20: 8-3-4-7-8
- Cycle 21: 9-2-7-4-9
- Cycle 22: 9-4-7-6-9

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Cycles with exactly one chord:
  - <0, (1, 7), 9>
  - <0, (1, 2), 9>
  - <1, (0, 3), 8>
  - <1, (2, 7), 4>
  - <2, (0, 6), 7>
  - <2, (1, 7), 4>
  - <2, (6, 0), 1>
  - <3, (0, 1), 2>
  - <3, (0, 4), 7>
  - <4, (2, 9), 7>
  - <4, (6, 2), 7>
  - <5, (1, 7), 4>
  - <5, (3, 4), 7>
  - <6, (0, 1), 2>
  - <7, (3, 0), 4>
  - <7, (8, 2), 4>
  - <8, (0, 4), 3>
  - <8, (3, 4), 7>
  - <9, (2, 7), 4>
  - <9, (4, 6), 7>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [20]
