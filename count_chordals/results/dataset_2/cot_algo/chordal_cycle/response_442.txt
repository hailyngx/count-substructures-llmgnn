Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 13) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 12) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 13) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (12, 11) (12, 1) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 14, 10, 7, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 1, 2, 10, 7, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 1, 5, 8, 2, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 4, 11, 8, 2, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 4, 3, 0, 10, 7, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 7, 10, 0, 3, 4, 6)
- Cycle 7: (9, 14, 10, 7, 6, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 14, 8, 11, 4, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 4, 3, 0, 13, 10, 9)
- Cycle 10: (4, 11, 8, 14, 9, 4)
- Cycle 11: (7, 10, 0, 3, 4, 11, 7)
- Cycle 12: (2, 8, 11, 4, 3, 0, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 8, 14, 10, 0, 2)
- Cycle 14: (8, 5, 1, 6, 9, 14, 8)
- Cycle 15: (8, 5, 1, 12, 11, 4, 8)
- Cycle 16: (8, 14, 9, 6, 1, 5, 8)
- Cycle 17: (3, 0, 2, 8, 11, 4, 3)
- Cycle 18: (1, 5, 8, 11, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 19: (0, 2, 8, 5, 1, 6, 0)
- Cycle 20: (10, 0, 3, 4, 11, 12, 10)
- Cycle 21: (10, 7, 6, 1, 5, 8, 10)
- Cycle 22: (10, 13, 0, 3, 4, 11, 10)
- Cycle 23: (11, 3, 0, 2, 8, 5, 11)
- Cycle 24: (5, 8, 14, 10, 13, 7, 5)
- Cycle 25: (14, 9, 6, 7, 10, 13, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycle is: 
- <5, (2, 8), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, hence [1].
