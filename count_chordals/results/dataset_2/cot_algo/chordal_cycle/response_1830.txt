Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- In cycle (1, 3, 13, 14), <1, (3, 13), 14> is a chordal 4-cycle.
- In cycle (1, 3, 8, 9), <1, (3, 8), 9> is a chordal 4-cycle.
- In cycle (1, 3, 8, 5), <1, (3, 8), 5> is a chordal 4-cycle.
- In cycle (1, 3, 13, 5), <1, (3, 13), 5> is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found = 0
Thus, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
