Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (2, 9) (2, 14) (2, 13) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 11) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 3) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (1, 11) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 3) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 12) (11, 4) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (2, 9, 0, 14)
        - Cycle 2: (9, 0, 14, 7)
        - Cycle 3: (0, 14, 7, 1)
        - Cycle 4: (14, 7, 1, 4)
        - Cycle 5: (7, 1, 4, 6)
        - Cycle 6: (1, 4, 6, 11)
        - Cycle 7: (4, 6, 11, 2)
        - Cycle 8: (6, 11, 2, 9)
        - Cycle 9: (14, 0, 9, 2)
        - Cycle 10: (0, 9, 2, 11)
        - Cycle 11: (9, 2, 11, 12)
        - Cycle 12: (9, 2, 13, 4)
        - Cycle 13: (2, 13, 4, 6)
        - Cycle 14: (13, 4, 6, 11)
        - Cycle 15: (3, 7, 14, 0)
        - Cycle 16: (7, 14, 0, 9)
        - Cycle 17: (3, 7, 1, 4)
        - Cycle 18: (7, 1, 4, 13)
        - Cycle 19: (3, 7, 14, 13)
        - Cycle 20: (7, 14, 13, 2)
        - Cycle 21: (3, 7, 1, 11)
        - Cycle 22: (2, 9, 12, 8)
        - Cycle 23: (9, 12, 8, 3)
        - Cycle 24: (4, 13, 2, 11)
        - Cycle 25: (6, 11, 4, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, (14, 7), 4, 6>
        - <2, 13, 4, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are [23] chordless cycles found.
