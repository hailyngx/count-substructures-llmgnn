Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 19) (26, 28) (26, 20) (4, 7) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 21) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 15) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 27) (22, 10) (22, 0) (22, 12) (23, 2) (23, 21) (23, 27) (12, 7) (12, 22) (12, 29) (12, 8) (24, 14) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 10) (21, 4) (21, 23) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 15) (19, 9) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 13) (16, 28) (16, 29) (16, 25) (16, 2) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 20) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 20) (17, 0) (20, 26) (20, 11) (20, 17) (20, 14) (0, 22) (0, 17) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 5) (29, 12) (29, 16) (27, 3) (27, 23) (27, 2) (13, 9) (13, 19) (13, 18) (25, 16) (25, 14) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 2) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 8) (2, 23) (2, 16) (2, 27) (2, 10) (14, 24) (14, 20) (14, 25) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 11) (8, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 9, 19, 5, 1, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 9, 19, 17, 4, 7, 12, 22, 10, 2, 27, 23, 21, 4, 15, 5, 19, 13, 18, 8, 1, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 9, 19, 17, 0, 22, 12, 7, 4, 21, 23, 27, 2, 10, 28, 26, 20, 11, 3)
- Cycle 4: (9, 19, 5, 15, 4, 21, 23, 27, 2, 16, 28, 10, 22, 0, 17, 20, 11, 8, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 9, 19, 13, 18, 8, 12, 29, 16, 25, 14, 24, 20, 11)
- Cycle 6: (9, 13, 18, 8, 1, 5, 15, 4, 7, 12, 22, 10, 2, 27, 23)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- For Cycle 1, there is no chord.
- For Cycle 2, there is no chord.
- For Cycle 3, there is no chord.
- For Cycle 4, there is no chord.
- For Cycle 5, there is no chord.
- For Cycle 6, there is no chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <3, 5, 15, 4>
- <9, 17, 19, 13>
- <4, 5, 15, 7>
- <5, 15, 4, 7>
- <19, 17, 4, 7>
- <3, 1, 5, 15>
