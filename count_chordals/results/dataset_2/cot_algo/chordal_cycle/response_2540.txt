Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 9) (13, 7) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 9) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (4, 9) (4, 5) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (14, 2) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 9) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-11-10-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-2-1-5-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-12-6-0
- Cycle 4: 0-6-7-5-0
- Cycle 5: 1-2-5-7-1
- Cycle 6: 1-9-13-7-1
- Cycle 7: 2-5-7-6-2
- Cycle 8: 4-5-7-6-4
- Cycle 9: 4-9-13-7-4
- Cycle 10: 8-3-12-13-8
- Cycle 11: 9-14-2-5-9
- Cycle 12: 9-10-11-5-9

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has the chord (1, 5).
- Cycle 6 has the chord (1, 13).
- Cycle 7 has the chord (2, 6).
- Cycle 8 has the chord (4, 7).
- Cycle 9 has the chord (4, 13).
- Cycle 10 has the chord (8, 12).
- Cycle 11 has the chord (9, 11).
- Cycle 12 has the chord (10, 5).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord.

Therefore, the final number is [7].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, 5, (1, 5)>
<1, 13, (1, 13)>
<2, 6, (2, 6)>
<4, 7, (4, 7)>
<4, 13, (4, 13)>
<8, 12, (8, 12)>
<9, 11, (9, 11)>
