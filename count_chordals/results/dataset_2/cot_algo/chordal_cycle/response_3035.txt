Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (8, 3) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 5) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 10) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 10) (11, 1) (11, 7) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 7) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-13-0-1
- Cycle 2: 1-11-7-14-1
- Cycle 3: 1-2-14-7-1
- Cycle 4: 1-12-9-14-1
- Cycle 5: 1-12-4-5-1
- Cycle 6: 1-11-7-6-1
- Cycle 7: 1-0-13-6-1
- Cycle 8: 1-2-10-7-1
- Cycle 9: 6-13-0-9-6
- Cycle 10: 6-14-7-10-6
- Cycle 11: 6-2-1-11-6
- Cycle 12: 6-7-11-1-6
- Cycle 13: 6-13-5-12-6
- Cycle 14: 6-2-14-9-6

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (6, 13), 0, (1, 12)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (11, 7), 14, (1, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (2, 14), 7, (1, 10)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (12, 9), 14, (1, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (12, 4), 5, (1, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (11, 7), 6, (1, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, (13, 0), 6, (1, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, (2, 10), 7, (1, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <6, (13, 0), 9, (6, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <6, (14, 7), 10, (6, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <6, (2, 1), 11, (6, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <6, (7, 11), 1, (6, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <6, (13, 5), 12, (6, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <6, (2, 14), 9, (6, 13)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
