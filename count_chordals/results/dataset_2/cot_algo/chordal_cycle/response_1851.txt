Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 7) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 10) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle 1: (4, 0, 14, 13, 9)
2. Cycle 2: (5, 4, 0, 14, 13)
3. Cycle 3: (5, 4, 3, 7, 9)
4. Cycle 4: (5, 4, 2, 12, 8)
5. Cycle 5: (5, 4, 3, 13, 9)
6. Cycle 6: (5, 1, 10, 0, 4)
7. Cycle 7: (6, 5, 4, 2, 9)
8. Cycle 8: (7, 1, 8, 13, 9)
9. Cycle 9: (7, 1, 10, 0, 14)
10. Cycle 10: (7, 1, 8, 12, 2)
11. Cycle 11: (7, 3, 4, 0, 14)
12. Cycle 12: (7, 3, 12, 8, 1)
13. Cycle 13: (11, 0, 4, 5, 1)
14. Cycle 14: (11, 0, 10, 1, 7)
15. Cycle 15: (11, 12, 8, 13, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Cycle 1 - Chord: (14, 9)
2. Cycle 2 - Chord: (0, 13)
3. Cycle 3 - Chord: (4, 9)
4. Cycle 4 - Chord: (4, 8)
5. Cycle 5 - Chord: (4, 13)
6. Cycle 7 - Chord: (4, 9)
7. Cycle 8 - Chord: (1, 9)
8. Cycle 9 - Chord: (1, 14)
9. Cycle 10 - Chord: (1, 8)
10. Cycle 11 - Chord: (3, 14)
11. Cycle 12 - Chord: (3, 8)
12. Cycle 14 - Chord: (0, 1)
13. Cycle 15 - Chord: (8, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are no chordless 4-cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [13]. 
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (14, 9), 9)>
<2, (0, 13), 13)>
<3, (4, 9), 5)>
<4, (4, 8), 2)>
<5, (4, 13), 1)>
<7, (4, 9), 2)>
<8, (1, 9), 13)>
<9, (1, 14), 10)>
<10, (1, 8), 12)>
<11, (3, 14), 7)>
<12, (3, 8), 1)>
<14, (0, 1), 7)>
<15, (8, 13), 13)>
