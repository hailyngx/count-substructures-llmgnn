Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 17) (9, 25) (9, 13) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 25) (15, 29) (15, 4) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 22) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 21) (10, 0) (10, 26) (10, 6) (10, 16) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 25) (23, 11) (23, 29) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 12) (0, 3) (0, 10) (16, 10) (16, 21) (28, 3) (28, 1) (28, 20) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 29) (24, 3) (24, 27) (19, 22) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 27) (8, 12) (8, 7) (21, 18) (21, 16) (21, 26) (7, 18) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 22) (12, 8) (25, 9) (25, 15) (25, 11) (25, 26) (26, 10) (26, 21) (26, 25) (26, 17) (20, 28) (17, 5) (17, 26) (29, 15) (29, 23) (29, 6) (27, 24) (27, 19) (27, 14) (1, 28) (1, 19) (1, 14) (14, 19) (14, 27) (14, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 7) (4, 15) (4, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 25, 11)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 29, 23)
- Cycle 3: (3, 24, 27, 19)
- Cycle 4: (3, 2, 18, 5)
- Cycle 5: (21, 18, 5, 17)
- Cycle 6: (21, 26, 17, 5)
- Cycle 7: (21, 26, 25, 15)
- Cycle 8: (0, 3, 15, 25)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (3, 25), 0>
- Chordal cycle 2: <2, (3, 29), 2>
- Chordal cycle 3: <3, (3, 27), 4>
- Chordal cycle 4: <5, (3, 18), 1>
- Chordal cycle 5: <6, (21, 5), 3>
- Chordal cycle 6: <7, (21, 25), 5>
- Chordal cycle 7: <8, (0, 15), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

So, the final answer is [0].
