Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- (5, 9, 8, 2, 5)
- (5, 9, 4, 0, 5)
- (5, 6, 7, 1, 5)
- (9, 8, 4, 0, 9)
- (8, 6, 2, 0, 8)
- (4, 3, 7, 6, 4)
- (7, 3, 8, 1, 7)
- (6, 5, 2, 0, 6)
- (2, 5, 1, 7, 2)
- (1, 7, 6, 3, 1)
- (3, 4, 0, 2, 3)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (7, 3), 6>
- <6, (5, 2), 7>
- <7, (1, 8), 6>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 8, so the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [3].
