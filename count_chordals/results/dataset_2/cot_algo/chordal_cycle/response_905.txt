Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (6, 9, 1, 5, 6)
- (6, 9, 1, 7, 6)
- (6, 9, 7, 5, 6)
- (6, 9, 7, 0, 6)
- (9, 1, 4, 2, 9)
- (9, 1, 5, 7, 9)
- (9, 7, 0, 3, 9)
- (9, 7, 2, 6, 9)
- (1, 5, 7, 9, 1)
- (1, 7, 0, 3, 1)
- (1, 7, 2, 4, 1)
- (3, 0, 7, 9, 3)
- (4, 2, 7, 9, 4)
- (5, 6, 9, 1, 5)
- (7, 0, 3, 1, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, 9, 1, (5, 6)>
- <6, 9, 1, (7, 6)>
- <6, 9, 7, (5, 6)>
- <6, 9, 7, (0, 6)>
- <9, 1, 4, (2, 9)>
- <9, 1, 5, (7, 9)>
- <9, 7, 0, (3, 9)>
- <9, 7, 2, (6, 9)>
- <1, 5, 7, (9, 1)>
- <1, 7, 0, (3, 1)>
- <1, 7, 2, (4, 1)>
- <3, 0, 7, (9, 3)>
- <4, 2, 7, (9, 4)>
- <5, 6, 9, (1, 5)>
- <7, 0, 3, (1, 7)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [14].
