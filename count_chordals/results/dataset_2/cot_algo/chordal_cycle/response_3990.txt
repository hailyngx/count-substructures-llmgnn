Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 12) (17, 11) (10, 18) (10, 16) (2, 18) (2, 8) (18, 10) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 7) (6, 5) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 19) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 15) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 15) (16, 10) (15, 5) (15, 11) (15, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 19) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 13) (13, 19) (13, 12) (1, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <5, 6, 18, 7, 5>
- <5, 9, 19, 13, 5>
- <6, 5, 9, 19, 6>
- <6, 18, 7, 14, 6>
- <6, 11, 3, 8, 6>
- <6, 12, 17, 14, 6>
- <6, 4, 0, 14, 6>
- <7, 0, 14, 17, 7>
- <7, 15, 11, 3, 7>
- <9, 5, 6, 11, 9>
- <9, 19, 13, 12, 9>
- <10, 18, 6, 5, 10>
- <11, 6, 5, 15, 11>
- <11, 17, 14, 0, 11>
- <11, 3, 8, 2, 11>
- <11, 15, 7, 0, 11>
- <12, 17, 14, 0, 12>
- <12, 6, 5, 9, 12>
- <12, 8, 3, 11, 12>
- <12, 13, 19, 4, 12>
- <13, 19, 9, 5, 13>
- <14, 17, 12, 13, 14>
- <15, 5, 6, 11, 15>
- <16, 10, 18, 6, 16>
- <17, 14, 0, 4, 17>
- <18, 6, 5, 9, 18>
- <19, 5, 6, 11, 19>
- <19, 9, 5, 13, 19>
- <19, 13, 12, 8, 19>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <5, 6, 18, 7> with chord (17, 14)

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
