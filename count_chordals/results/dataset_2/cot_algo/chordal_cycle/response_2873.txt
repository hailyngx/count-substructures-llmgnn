Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: 4-7-2-0-4
- Cycle 2: 4-9-6-1-4
- Cycle 3: 4-5-8-0-4
- Cycle 4: 7-3-6-1-7
- Cycle 5: 7-2-0-8-7
- Cycle 6: 1-3-7-2-1
- Cycle 7: 1-6-9-4-1
- Cycle 8: 3-6-9-8-3
- Cycle 9: 3-5-8-0-3
- Cycle 10: 6-9-8-5-6

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Checking Cycle 1: 4-7-2-0-4 (Chord: (7, 0))
- Checking Cycle 2: 4-9-6-1-4 (Chord: (9, 1))
- Checking Cycle 3: 4-5-8-0-4 (Chord: (5, 8))
- Checking Cycle 4: 7-3-6-1-7 (Chord: (3, 6))
- Checking Cycle 5: 7-2-0-8-7 (Chord: (2, 8))
- Checking Cycle 6: 1-3-7-2-1 (Chord: (3, 2))
- Checking Cycle 7: 1-6-9-4-1 (Chord: (6, 9))
- Checking Cycle 8: 3-6-9-8-3 (Chord: (6, 9))
- Checking Cycle 9: 3-5-8-0-3 (Chord: (5, 8))
- Checking Cycle 10: 6-9-8-5-6 (Chord: (8, 5))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<4, (7, 0)> 
<4, (9, 1)>
<4, (5, 8)>
<7, (3, 6)>
<7, (2, 8)>
<1, (3, 2)>
<1, (6, 9)>
<3, (6, 9)>
<3, (5, 8)>
<6, (8, 5)>
