Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 18) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 11) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 19) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 0) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 7) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 2) (18, 15) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (15, 10) (15, 18) (19, 8) (19, 13) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 4) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 11) (6, 3) (6, 12) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 12, 14)
- Cycle 2: (8, 13, 1, 4)
- Cycle 3: (8, 13, 19, 8)
- Cycle 4: (10, 11, 7, 14)
- Cycle 5: (18, 2, 8, 13)
- Cycle 6: (0, 9, 12, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 14, 7, 11)
- Cycle 8: (0, 14, 17, 16)
- Cycle 9: (0, 10, 15, 18)
- Cycle 10: (7, 14, 17, 16)
- Cycle 11: (12, 0, 10, 15)
- Cycle 12: (12, 0, 14, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1: <1, (9, 12), 4>
- Cycle 2: <2, (13, 19), 8>
- Cycle 3: <3, (8, 19), 13>
- Cycle 4: <4, (10, 7), 11>
- Cycle 5: <5, (2, 13), 8>
- Cycle 6: <6, (9, 0), 12>
- Cycle 7: <7, (14, 11), 7>
- Cycle 8: <8, (14, 16), 17>
- Cycle 9: <9, (10, 15), 18>
- Cycle 10: <10, (14, 16), 17>
- Cycle 11: <11, (0, 15), 10>
- Cycle 12: <12, (7, 10), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [12]

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [12].

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
