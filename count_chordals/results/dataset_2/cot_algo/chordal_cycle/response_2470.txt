Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 0) (5, 10) (1, 14) (1, 18) (3, 19) (8, 13) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 15) (12, 13) (12, 14) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 15) (7, 11) (7, 17) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 7) (17, 18) (4, 14) (4, 6) (19, 3) (19, 13) (19, 14) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 0) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 18) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 2) (18, 1) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 0) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Some of the cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-17-8-16-15-0
- Cycle 2: 1-14-4-6-10-11-1
- Cycle 3: 2-13-8-16-15-0-2
- Cycle 4: 3-19-14-4-6-10-3
- Cycle 5: 7-11-10-6-4-14-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Out of the cycles listed above, only Cycle 2: 1-14-4-6-10-11-1 has exactly one chord (2, 13) connecting non-adjacent nodes 1 and 10.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As only one chordal 4-cycle was found, the final count is [1].

List of unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, (2, 13), 10>
