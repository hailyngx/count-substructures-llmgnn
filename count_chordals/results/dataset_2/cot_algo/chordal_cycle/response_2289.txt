Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 0) (12, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, and we will analyze them to find chordal 4-cycles.

Cycles of Length 4:
1. Cycle: <6, 9, 4, 5, 6>
2. Cycle: <8, 13, 11, 12, 8>
3. Cycle: <7, 11, 12, 0, 7>
4. Cycle: <5, 8, 13, 10, 5>
5. Cycle: <0, 12, 11, 14, 0>
6. Cycle: <4, 9, 2, 10, 4>
7. Cycle: <1, 8, 13, 10, 1>
8. Cycle: <2, 6, 11, 14, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

After analyzing each cycle, we find that the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 6, 11, 14, 2> with chord (11, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
