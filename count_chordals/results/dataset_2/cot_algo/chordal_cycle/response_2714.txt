- Cycle 7: (1, 23, 6, 29)
- Cycle 8: (1, 23, 22, 20)
- Cycle 9: (1, 23, 27, 3)
- Cycle 10: (1, 23, 27, 7)

- Cycle 21: (16, 8, 19, 16)
- Cycle 22: (16, 2, 25, 14)
- Cycle 23: (22, 20, 7, 10)
- Cycle 24: (22, 20, 15, 6)
- Cycle 25: (25, 18, 15, 6)
- Cycle 26: (25, 18, 1, 23)
- Cycle 27: (25, 29, 6, 23)
- Cycle 28: (25, 29, 1, 18)
- Cycle 29: (27, 23, 22, 20)
- Cycle 30: (27, 23, 1, 8)
- Cycle 31: (27, 23, 3, 22)
- Cycle 32: (27, 23, 1, 29)
- Cycle 33: (27, 7, 20, 22)

- Cycle 36: (13, 11, 10, 7)
- Cycle 37: (13, 11, 27, 23)
- Cycle 38: (13, 11, 27, 7)
- Cycle 39: (13, 28, 14, 2)
- Cycle 40: (13, 28, 14, 25)
- Cycle 41: (14, 28, 13, 11)
- Cycle 42: (14, 28, 13, 24)
- Cycle 43: (14, 2, 25, 29)
- Cycle 44: (17, 24, 13, 11)
- Cycle 45: (3, 22, 23, 1)
- Cycle 46: (3, 22, 27, 11)
- Cycle 47: (4, 12, 4, 5)
- Cycle 48: (6, 0, 21, 15)
- Cycle 49: (6, 0, 21, 15)
- Cycle 50: (7, 1, 18, 15) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <1, (23, 8), 27)>
- <1, (18, 15), 6)>
- <13, (11, 13), 24)>
- <14, (28, 14), 2)>
- <15, (6, 29), 18)>
- <22, (20, 7), 10)>
- <25, (18, 15), 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 44 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the answer is [44].
