Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 4) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 2) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 1) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 0) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph, but only 4-cycles and larger will be considered. 

1. <0, 8, 11, 4, 12>
2. <2, 9, 13, 3, 0>
3. <6, 5, 11, 4, 10>
4. <6, 5, 7, 2, 10>
5. <6, 10, 4, 12, 1>
6. <8, 11, 5, 6, 10>
7. <11, 5, 7, 2, 10>
8. <11, 13, 9, 8, 0>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
1. <0, 8, 11, 4, 12> has a chord 8, connecting non-adjacent nodes 0 and 11.
2. <2, 9, 13, 3, 0> has a chord 9, connecting non-adjacent nodes 2 and 13.
3. <6, 5, 11, 4, 10> has a chord 5, connecting non-adjacent nodes 6 and 11.
4. <6, 5, 7, 2, 10> has a chord 7, connecting non-adjacent nodes 5 and 2.
5. <6, 10, 4, 12, 1> has a chord 10, connecting non-adjacent nodes 6 and 4.
6. <8, 11, 5, 6, 10> has a chord 11, connecting non-adjacent nodes 8 and 6.
7. <11, 5, 7, 2, 10> has a chord 2, connecting non-adjacent nodes 7 and 10.
8. <11, 13, 9, 8, 0> has a chord 13, connecting non-adjacent nodes 11 and 9.
  
Step 3:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [8].
