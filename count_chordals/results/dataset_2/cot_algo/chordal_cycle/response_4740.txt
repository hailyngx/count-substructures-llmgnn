- Cycle 4: 4-12-0-5-4
- Cycle 5: 7-9-8-11-7
- Cycle 6: 7-13-10-11-7
- Cycle 7: 7-13-8-9-7
- Cycle 8: 10-11-8-13-10
- Cycle 9: 10-13-7-3-10
- Cycle 10: 6-8-1-0-6
- Cycle 11: 6-10-14-12-6
- Cycle 12: 6-5-0-12-6
- Cycle 13: 0-12-2-7-0
- Cycle 14: 0-1-8-13-0
- Cycle 15: 0-5-6-3-0
- Cycle 16: 11-8-13-1-11
- Cycle 17: 8-6-2-12-8
- Cycle 18: 8-9-12-4-8
- Cycle 19: 13-7-2-12-13
- Cycle 20: 13-3-6-10-13
- Cycle 21: 5-10-14-12-5
- Cycle 22: 10-6-2-12-10
- Cycle 23: 6-4-12-14-6
- Cycle 24: 1-0-12-14-1

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <4, (10, 6), 11, 8>
- <4, (6, 10), 5, 0>
- <4, (6, 8), 11, 4>
- <4, (12, 0), 5, 6>
- <7, (13, 10), 11, 7>
- <7, (9, 8), 11, 7>
- <7, (13, 8), 9, 7>
- <10, (11, 8), 13, 10>
- <10, (13, 7), 3, 10>
- <6, (8, 1), 0, 6>
- <6, (10, 14), 12, 6>
- <6, (5, 0), 12, 6>
- <0, (12, 2), 7, 0>
- <0, (1, 8), 13, 0>
- <0, (5, 6), 3, 0>
- <11, (8, 13), 1, 11>
- <8, (6, 2), 12, 8>
- <8, (9, 12), 4, 8>
- <13, (7, 2), 12, 13>
- <13, (3, 6), 10, 13>
- <5, (10, 14), 12, 5>
- <10, (6, 2), 12, 10>
- <6, (4, 12), 14, 6>
- <1, (0, 12), 14, 1>

Step 3:
There are a total of [24] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
