Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 18) (10, 17) (10, 1) (11, 19) (11, 5) (17, 10) (17, 19) (2, 9) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 4) (18, 13) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 11) (5, 16) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 4) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 16) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 12) (19, 11) (19, 17) (19, 15) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 15) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 5) (16, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 13, 8>
- Cycle 2: <1, 10, 17, 19, 15>
- Cycle 3: <1, 10, 17, 19, 11>
- Cycle 4: <1, 10, 17, 19, 15, 18, 2>
- Cycle 5: <1, 10, 17, 19, 15, 12, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 10, 17, 19, 15, 12, 13, 8>
- Cycle 7: <1, 10, 17, 19, 15, 12, 0, 7, 4>
- Cycle 8: <1, 10, 17, 19, 15, 12, 0, 7, 8>
- Cycle 9: <1, 10, 17, 19, 15, 18, 2, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 8) -> <1, (1, 8), 13, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (10, 19) -> <10, (10, 19), 17, 1, 15>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (10, 17) -> <10, (10, 17), 19, 1, 15>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (10, 17) -> <10, (10, 17), 19, 1, 15>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (10, 12) -> <10, 17, 19, (10, 12), 15, 1>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (10, 12) -> <10, 17, 19, (10, 12), 15, 1>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (0, 7) -> <0, (0, 7), 4, 14, 16>
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (7, 8) -> <7, (7, 8), 6, 0, 12>
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (9, 2) -> <9, (9, 2), 18, 15, 19>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
