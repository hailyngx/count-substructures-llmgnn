- Cycle 5: 2 - 11 - 4 - 11 - 2
- Cycle 6: 2 - 10 - 11 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 7: 2 - 15 - 12 - 19 - 2
- Cycle 8: 2 - 15 - 8 - 19 - 2
- Cycle 9: 8 - 15 - 12 - 6 - 8
- Cycle 10: 8 - 15 - 2 - 10 - 8
- Cycle 11: 8 - 15 - 12 - 19 - 8
- Cycle 12: 8 - 15 - 2 - 19 - 8
- Cycle 13: 9 - 13 - 9 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 14: 14 - 8 - 15 - 12 - 14
- Cycle 15: 14 - 8 - 15 - 2 - 14
- Cycle 16: 14 - 8 - 15 - 12 - 14
- Cycle 17: 14 - 8 - 15 - 2 - 14
- Cycle 18: 16 - 3 - 17 - 0 - 16
- Cycle 19: 16 - 3 - 17 - 0 - 16
- Cycle 20: 16 - 14 - 18 - 16
- Cycle 21: 16 - 18 - 7 - 11 - 16
- Cycle 22: 16 - 18 - 14 - 8 - 16
- Cycle 23: 18 - 14 - 8 - 15 - 18
- Cycle 24: 18 - 14 - 8 - 15 - 18
- Cycle 25: 18 - 7 - 11 - 4 - 18
- Cycle 26: 18 - 7 - 11 - 5 - 18

Step 2: Cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 0> with (1, 3) as chord
- <2, 10, 5, 11> with (5, 11) as chord
- <2, 11, 7, 0> with (7, 11) as chord
- <2, 10, 11, 7> with (10, 11) as chord
- <2, 15, 12, 19> with (12, 15) as chord

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: [5]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, 3, 0> with chord (1, 3)
- <2, 10, 5, 11> with chord (5, 11)
- <2, 11, 7, 0> with chord (7, 11)
- <2, 10, 11, 7> with chord (10, 11)
- <2, 15, 12, 19> with chord (12, 15)
