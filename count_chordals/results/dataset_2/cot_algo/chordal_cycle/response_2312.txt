Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (15, 16) (15, 12) (8, 19) (8, 7) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 9) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 17) (1, 16) (1, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 18) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 19) (17, 16) (17, 0) (17, 13) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 14) (10, 4) (10, 0) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 19) (14, 6) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (11, 16, 14, 11)
- (16, 14, 19, 16)
- (3, 5, 1, 16, 3)
- (3, 5, 11, 16, 3)
- (3, 5, 1, 16, 14, 19, 13, 12, 3)
- (3, 5, 1, 16, 15, 12, 3)
- (3, 6, 4, 9, 3)
- (3, 6, 4, 18, 19, 13, 12, 3)
- (3, 6, 4, 9, 18, 19, 13, 12, 3)
- (3, 12, 15, 16, 14, 19, 13, 12, 3)
- (3, 12, 15, 16, 11, 0, 10, 4, 6, 3)
- (8, 7, 6, 4, 9, 3)
- (8, 7, 6, 14, 16, 11, 0, 10, 4, 9, 8)
- (8, 19, 13, 17, 16, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4, 9, 18, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
   
The only chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <3, (12, 19), 13, 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
