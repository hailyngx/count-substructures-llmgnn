Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 12) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 9) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 13) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 8) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 7, 6, 2)
- Cycle 3: (2, 8, 1, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 8, 12, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 8, 10, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 9, 12, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 9, 11, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 9, 0, 2)
- Cycle 9: (3, 4, 7, 3)
- Cycle 10: (3, 12, 8, 3)
- Cycle 11: (4, 7, 2, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 12, 8, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 12, 11, 4)
- Cycle 14: (5, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 15: (6, 7, 2, 6)
- Cycle 16: (6, 11, 12, 6)
- Cycle 17: (6, 5, 10, 6)
- Cycle 18: (7, 10, 5, 7)
- Cycle 19: (8, 12, 9, 8)
- Cycle 20: (9, 12, 11, 9)
- Cycle 21: (9, 0, 5, 9)
- Cycle 22: (10, 5, 6, 10)
- Cycle 23: (11, 12, 9, 11)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with one and only one chord:
- Cycle 2: (2, 7, 6, 2) has a chord (6, 2) -> <2, (6, 2), 7>
- Cycle 3: (2, 8, 1, 2) has a chord (1, 8) -> <3, (1, 8), 2>
- Cycle 4: (2, 8, 12, 2) has a chord (12, 8) -> <4, (12, 8), 2>
- Cycle 5: (2, 8, 10, 2) has a chord (10, 8) -> <5, (10, 8), 2>
- Cycle 6: (2, 9, 12, 2) has a chord (12, 9) -> <6, (12, 9), 2>
- Cycle 7: (2, 9, 11, 2) has a chord (11, 9) -> <7, (11, 9), 2>
- Cycle 8: (2, 9, 0, 2) has a chord (0, 9) -> <8, (0, 9), 2>
- Cycle 14: (5, 6, 7, 5) has a chord (7, 6) -> <9, (7, 6), 5>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 15 cycles listed in step 1.
- Out of these, 9 cycles have one and only one chord.
- Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [15 - 9] = [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<2, (6, 2), 7>
<3, (1, 8), 2>
<4, (12, 8), 2>
<5, (10, 8), 2>
<6, (12, 9), 2>
<7, (11, 9), 2>
<8, (0, 9), 2>
<9, (7, 6), 5>
