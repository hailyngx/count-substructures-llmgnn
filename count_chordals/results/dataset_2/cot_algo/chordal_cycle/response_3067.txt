Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 4, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 4, 7, 3, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (9, 5, 1, 4, 9)
        - Cycle 4: (9, 2, 4, 6, 9)
        - Cycle 5: (6, 3, 0, 1, 6)
        - Cycle 6: (1, 4, 3, 0, 1)
        - Cycle 7: (3, 6, 8, 2, 3)
        - Cycle 8: (4, 1, 0, 3, 4)
        - Cycle 9: (7, 5, 4, 2, 7)
        - Cycle 10: (2, 9, 0, 6, 2)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - <1, (3, 5), 6> is a chordal 4-cycle as it has exactly one chord connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle.
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
