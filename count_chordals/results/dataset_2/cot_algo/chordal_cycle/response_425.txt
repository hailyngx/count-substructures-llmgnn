Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 15) (17, 11) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 14) (0, 6) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 9) (8, 17) (8, 5) (8, 19) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 9) (16, 2) (1, 5) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 9) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 10) (11, 17) (11, 12) (11, 7) (11, 2) (9, 19) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 3) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (18, 5) (18, 12) (18, 1) (18, 15) (13, 19) (13, 4) (2, 16) (2, 11) (15, 17) (15, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- {14, 0, 6, 5, 8, 17, 14}
- {14, 0, 6, 5, 8, 17, 19, 13, 4, 10, 7, 11, 2, 16}
- {17, 8, 5, 18, 12, 11, 7, 10, 4, 13, 19, 9}
- {5, 18, 12, 11, 7, 3, 9, 4, 13, 19, 17, 15}

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- {14, 0, 6, 5, 8, 17, 14} has 1 chord: (14, 17)
- {14, 0, 6, 5, 8, 17, 19, 13, 4, 10, 7, 11, 2, 16} has 1 chord: (10, 4)
- {17, 8, 5, 18, 12, 11, 7, 10, 4, 13, 19, 9} has 1 chord: (17, 15)
- {5, 18, 12, 11, 7, 3, 9, 4, 13, 19, 17, 15} has 0 chords.

Step 3: 
Count of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (14, 17), 4, 5>
- <2, (4, 10), 7, 11, 13>
- <3, (17, 15), 8, 9, 12, 18>
