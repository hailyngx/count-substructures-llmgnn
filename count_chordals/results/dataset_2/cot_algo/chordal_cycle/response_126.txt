Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 17) (26, 8) (15, 27) (15, 25) (27, 15) (27, 12) (27, 22) (27, 13) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 17) (14, 18) (17, 26) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 4) (12, 27) (12, 20) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 26) (8, 11) (8, 0) (28, 5) (29, 26) (29, 6) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 1) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (13, 27) (13, 5) (13, 6) (3, 9) (3, 6) (21, 19) (21, 23) (21, 22) (2, 4) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 7) (2, 25) (22, 27) (22, 21) (22, 2) (22, 10) (0, 8) (10, 22) (10, 16) (6, 29) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 24) (24, 6) (7, 11) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 11) (20, 12) (20, 16) (19, 4) (19, 21) (19, 16) (19, 23) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 25) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 19) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 20) (16, 19) (25, 15) (25, 2) (25, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <9, 26, 14, 9>
- Cycle 2: <15, 27, 12, 15>
- Cycle 3: <27, 22, 2, 27>
- Cycle 4: <27, 13, 5, 27>
- Cycle 5: <14, 17, 4, 14>
- Cycle 6: <26, 8, 11, 26>
- Cycle 7: <26, 29, 6, 26>
- Cycle 8: <8, 11, 1, 8>
- Cycle 9: <5, 13, 6, 5>
- Cycle 10: <4, 17, 14, 4>
- Cycle 11: <13, 6, 24, 13>
- Cycle 12: <2, 4, 17, 2>
- Cycle 13: <2, 22, 27, 2>
- Cycle 14: <2, 25, 15, 2>
- Cycle 15: <22, 10, 16, 22>
- Cycle 16: <7, 11, 1, 7>
- Cycle 17: <19, 21, 22, 19>
- Cycle 18: <16, 10, 22, 16>
- Cycle 19: <18, 25, 15, 18>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <9, 26, 14, 9> has chord (26, 14)
- Cycle 3 <27, 22, 2, 27> has chord (22, 2)
- Cycle 5 <14, 17, 4, 14> has chord (17, 4)
- Cycle 6 <26, 8, 11, 26> has chord (8, 11)
- Cycle 12 <2, 4, 17, 2> has chord (4, 17)
- Cycle 15 <22, 10, 16, 22> has chord (10, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- 6 chordal 4-cycles found in total, so the final count is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <9, 26, 14, 9> (Chord: (26, 14))
- <27, 22, 2, 27> (Chord: (22, 2))
- <14, 17, 4, 14> (Chord: (17, 4))
- <26, 8, 11, 26> (Chord: (8, 11))
- <2, 4, 17, 2> (Chord: (4, 17))
- <22, 10, 16, 22> (Chord: (10, 16))
