Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-7-1-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-2-3-4-0
- Cycle 3: 2-5-7-1-6-2
- Cycle 4: 2-4-3-8-2
- Cycle 5: 3-0-4-9-3
- Cycle 6: 3-2-4-8-3
- Cycle 7: 4-0-5-9-4
- Cycle 8: 4-3-8-9-4
- Cycle 9: 5-0-3-2-5
- Cycle 10: 5-7-6-1-5
- Cycle 11: 6-1-7-5-9-6
- Cycle 12: 6-5-0-3-6
- Cycle 13: 7-5-0-2-7
- Cycle 14: 8-3-0-5-8
- Cycle 15: 8-9-4-2-8
- Cycle 16: 9-4-3-0-9
- Cycle 17: 9-5-7-6-9

Step 2:
The cycles with a single chord are:
- <1, (7, 5), 6>
- <2, (4, 8), 3>
- <5, (0, 3), 2>
- <3, (8, 4), 2>
- <4, (0, 5), 9>
- <8, (0, 5), 3>

Step 3:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
