Step 2: Identifying chordal 4-cycles:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (29, 26), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (0, 4), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (25, 15), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, (16, 20), 28>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <8, (19, 11), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, (6, 4), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <10, (15, 22), 28>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <12, (18, 10), 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <13, (25, 13), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <14, (6, 16), 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <18, (12, 24), 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <20, (10, 16), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <23, (5, 26), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <24, (6, 2), 4> 

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 14 chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final count is [14].
