- Cycle 4: (1, 10, 7, 11, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 26, 5, 0, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 26, 20, 13, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 10, 2, 9, 1)
- Cycle 8: (26, 5, 0, 3, 26)
- Cycle 9: (26, 20, 13, 4, 26)

- Cycle 11: (11, 7, 10, 2, 11)
- Cycle 12: (11, 9, 2, 18, 11)
- Cycle 13: (5, 26, 20, 22, 5)
- Cycle 14: (5, 26, 1, 10, 5)

- Cycle 17: (0, 24, 28, 29, 0)
- Cycle 18: (0, 24, 15, 26, 0)
- Cycle 19: (3, 0, 24, 15, 3)
- Cycle 20: (3, 14, 7, 10, 3)
- Cycle 21: (3, 23, 17, 27, 3)
- Cycle 22: (15, 26, 1, 10, 15)
- Cycle 23: (15, 24, 28, 29, 15)
- Cycle 24: (15, 24, 0, 3, 15)
- Cycle 25: (20, 26, 1, 10, 20)
- Cycle 26: (20, 13, 4, 26, 20)
- Cycle 27: (20, 22, 6, 12, 20)
- Cycle 28: (14, 7, 11, 9, 14)
- Cycle 29: (14, 3, 0, 24, 14)
- Cycle 30: (14, 22, 20, 26, 14)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (10, 7), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (26, 20), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <26, (5, 0), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <26, (20, 13), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, (2, 11), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <11, (7, 10), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <11, (9, 2), 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <15, (24, 0), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <20, (13, 4), 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <22, (6, 12), 20>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <26, (1, 10), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <27, (17, 23), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <28, (24, 0), 29>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <28, (29, 0), 24>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <28, (16, 19), 27>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <3, (0, 24), 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <6, (12, 5), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <7, (11, 9), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <8, (15, 24), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 20: <21, (22, 20), 27>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [20]
