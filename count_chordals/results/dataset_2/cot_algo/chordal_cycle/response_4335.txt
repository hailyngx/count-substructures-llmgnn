Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 24) (0, 23) (27, 17) (3, 2) (3, 19) (25, 9) (25, 15) (23, 0) (23, 14) (23, 16) (10, 21) (10, 16) (10, 29) (11, 14) (11, 24) (11, 26) (7, 13) (7, 21) (7, 6) (7, 9) (21, 10) (21, 7) (21, 16) (21, 8) (2, 3) (2, 18) (2, 1) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 17) (15, 25) (15, 20) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 28) (20, 15) (20, 17) (20, 4) (26, 11) (26, 28) (26, 4) (28, 15) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 1) (17, 27) (17, 18) (17, 15) (17, 20) (5, 24) (5, 14) (19, 3) (19, 29) (16, 23) (16, 10) (16, 21) (16, 18) (16, 28) (9, 25) (9, 7) (9, 15) (9, 1) (29, 10) (29, 19) (4, 20) (4, 26) (4, 12) (12, 13) (12, 4) (1, 2) (1, 28) (1, 9) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 24) (14, 23) (14, 11) (14, 18) (14, 5) (24, 0) (24, 11) (24, 5) (24, 6) (8, 21) (8, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0-13-7-6-24-5-14-11-26-4-12-13-0
- Cycle 2: 0-13-7-21-8-1-2-18-14-11-26-4-12-0
- Cycle 3: 0-23-16-21-10-29-19-3-2-18-14-5-24-6-7-0
- Cycle 4: 0-23-14-5-24-6-7-13-12-4-26-11-14-18-16-23-0
- Cycle 5: 0-23-16-18-17-27-15-9-25-15-20-4-12-4-26-28-1-2-3-19-29-10-16-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The chordal 4-cycles found are:
    <0, 1, 8, 21>
    <0, 5, 14, 23>
    <16, 18, 2, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
