Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
There are several cycles in the graph, but we will only focus on cycles of length 4 as they can potentially form chordal 4-cycles.

The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-9-5-0-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-2-6-1
- Cycle 3: 3-4-2-9-3
- Cycle 4: 3-8-7-2-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Out of the identified cycles, Cycle 1 <1, 9, 5, 0> has exactly one chord <1, 5>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Since only Cycle 1 forms a chordal 4-cycle, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [1]. 

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 9, 5, 0> with chord <1, 5>.
