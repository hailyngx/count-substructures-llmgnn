Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 18) (10, 1) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 5) (0, 19) (7, 17) (7, 9) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 15) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 4) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 13) (19, 0) (19, 6) (19, 12) (14, 15) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 13) (12, 8) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 5) (16, 15) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 8) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 5) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (9, 17) (9, 7) (9, 2) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 16) (15, 13) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 15) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 5, 16, 17, 10>
2. Cycle <0, 5, 8, 12, 6>
3. Cycle <0, 19, 12, 13, 11>
4. Cycle <1, 10, 17, 16, 5>
5. Cycle <1, 10, 18, 13, 11>
6. Cycle <1, 2, 9, 7, 17>
7. Cycle <1, 2, 4, 6, 15>
8. Cycle <2, 4, 6, 19, 0>
9. Cycle <2, 4, 6, 12, 8>
10. Cycle <5, 8, 11, 13, 18>
11. Cycle <6, 12, 13, 16, 17>
12. Cycle <8, 11, 13, 16, 15>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
1. Cycle <0, 5, 16, 17, 10> has a chord (5, 10).
2. Cycle <0, 5, 8, 12, 6> has a chord (5, 12).
3. Cycle <0, 19, 12, 13, 11> has a chord (12, 13).
4. Cycle <1, 10, 17, 16, 5> has a chord (17, 5).
5. Cycle <1, 10, 18, 13, 11> has a chord (18, 11).
6. Cycle <1, 2, 9, 7, 17> has a chord (2, 7).
7. Cycle <1, 2, 4, 6, 15> has a chord (2, 15).
8. Cycle <2, 4, 6, 19, 0> has a chord (4, 19).
9. Cycle <2, 4, 6, 12, 8> has a chord (4, 12).
10. Cycle <5, 8, 11, 13, 18> has a chord (8, 13).
11. Cycle <6, 12, 13, 16, 17> has a chord (12, 16).
12. Cycle <8, 11, 13, 16, 15> has a chord (11, 16).

Step 3:
The count of chordal 4-cycles is [12].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 5, 16, 17, 10>
<0, 5, 8, 12, 6>
<0, 19, 12, 13, 11>
<1, 10, 17, 16, 5>
<1, 10, 18, 13, 11>
<1, 2, 9, 7, 17>
<1, 2, 4, 6, 15>
<2, 4, 6, 19, 0>
<2, 4, 6, 12, 8>
<5, 8, 11, 13, 18>
<6, 12, 13, 16, 17>
<8, 11, 13, 16, 15>
