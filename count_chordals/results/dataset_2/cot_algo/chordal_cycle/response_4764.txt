Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-3-5-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-0-6-8-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-3-0-6-1

Step 2:
Out of the above cycles, Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 have exactly one chord each. Therefore, the chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <1, (3, 5), 2>
- <1, (0, 6), 8>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found gives [2].
