Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (26, 23) (26, 3) (5, 6) (5, 29) (5, 11) (14, 17) (14, 18) (14, 15) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 28) (17, 21) (0, 27) (0, 22) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 1) (6, 5) (6, 28) (6, 29) (6, 13) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 16) (28, 24) (28, 2) (2, 28) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 21) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 21) (7, 2) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 4) (1, 17) (1, 27) (1, 20) (1, 22) (16, 28) (16, 8) (16, 3) (20, 1) (20, 19) (29, 5) (29, 14) (29, 6) (4, 12) (4, 10) (23, 26) (23, 0) (11, 5) (11, 25) (19, 20) (19, 25) (19, 10) (25, 11) (25, 19) (25, 21) (25, 18) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 21) (22, 0) (22, 1) (22, 3) (24, 28) (24, 13) (18, 14) (18, 25) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 3) (10, 4) (10, 19) (10, 18) (3, 26) (3, 16) (3, 22) (3, 18) (13, 6) (13, 24) (21, 17) (21, 2) (21, 8) (21, 25) (21, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle <1, 17, 20, 1>
        - Cycle <1, 17, 28, 6, 29, 14>
        - Cycle <1, 17, 28, 2, 21, 15>
        - Cycle <1, 27, 0, 23, 26>
        - Cycle <2, 28, 24, 13, 6>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - The cycle <1, 17, 20, 1> has no chords.
        - The cycle <1, 17, 28, 6, 29, 14> has one chord: (6, 14).
        - The cycle <1, 17, 28, 2, 21, 15> has no chords.
        - The cycle <1, 27, 0, 23, 26> has one chord: (0, 26).
        - The cycle <2, 28, 24, 13, 6> has no chords.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        - There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found.

Final Answer: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <1, 17, 28, 6, (14), 29, 14>
        <1, 27, 0, (26), 23, 26>
