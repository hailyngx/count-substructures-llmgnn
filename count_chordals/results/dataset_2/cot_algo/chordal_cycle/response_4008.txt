Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 10) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 12) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 8) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 14 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 12 - 4 - 7 - 3 - 12 - 5
- Cycle 3: 9 - 6 - 3 - 7 - 4 - 12 - 9
- Cycle 4: 9 - 2 - 7 - 4 - 12 - 9
- Cycle 5: 4 - 7 - 2 - 9 - 0 - 14 - 4
- Cycle 6: 4 - 10 - 13 - 6 - 9 - 0 - 4
- Cycle 7: 7 - 3 - 6 - 9 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 8: 7 - 1 - 14 - 0 - 9 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 9: 6 - 3 - 12 - 4 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 10: 12 - 5 - 13 - 6 - 3 - 12
- Cycle 11: 12 - 4 - 10 - 13 - 5 - 12
- Cycle 12: 0 - 9 - 2 - 7 - 1 - 14 - 0
- Cycle 13: 14 - 6 - 13 - 10 - 4 - 12 - 14
- Cycle 14: 2 - 9 - 0 - 14 - 1 - 7 - 2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (6, 12).
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (7, 9).
- Cycle 6 has no chords.
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (3, 9).
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (1, 7).
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (3, 6).
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (5, 3).
- Cycle 11 has no chords.
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (2, 9).
- Cycle 13 has no chords.
- Cycle 14 has one chord: (2, 7).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 9 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (7, 9), 14)>
- <3, (5, 3), 12)>
- <6, (3, 6), 9)>
