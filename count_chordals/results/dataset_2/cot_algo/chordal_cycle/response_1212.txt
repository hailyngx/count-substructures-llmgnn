Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 18) (15, 2) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 16) (1, 29) (1, 23) (1, 18) (21, 24) (21, 0) (0, 27) (0, 21) (0, 8) (0, 13) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 18) (11, 5) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 26) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 17) (12, 17) (12, 9) (17, 7) (17, 12) (17, 16) (18, 15) (18, 1) (18, 11) (18, 4) (19, 26) (19, 14) (26, 4) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 23) (26, 25) (24, 21) (24, 3) (24, 28) (24, 20) (24, 25) (13, 0) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 16) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 2) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 20) (28, 24) (22, 27) (22, 20) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 29) (23, 1) (23, 26) (23, 6) (29, 1) (29, 14) (29, 25) (16, 27) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 20) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 3) (6, 7) (6, 23) (6, 25) (20, 24) (20, 5) (20, 22) (20, 16) (8, 0) (9, 12) (25, 26) (25, 24) (25, 29) (25, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        Cycles of length 4:
        - (0, 21, 24, 3, 11): Chords: (0, 21), (24, 3)
        - (0, 13, 26, 19, 14): Chords: (0, 13), (26, 19)
        - (0, 13, 16, 27, 22): Chords: (0, 13), (16, 27)
        - (0, 8, 21, 24, 25): Chords: (0, 8), (21, 24)
        - (1, 29, 25, 6, 7): Chords: (1, 29), (25, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        - <0, 21, 24, (3, 11)>
        - <0, 13, 26, (19, 14)>
        - <0, 13, 16, (27, 22)>
        - <0, 8, 21, (24, 25)>
        - <1, 29, 25, (6, 7)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
