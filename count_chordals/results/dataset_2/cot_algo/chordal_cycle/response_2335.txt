Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 4) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 1) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 13) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 12) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-10-3-0
- Cycle 2: 1-8-14-4-1
- Cycle 3: 2-4-14-9-2
- Cycle 4: 3-4-11-10-3
- Cycle 5: 5-8-14-9-5
- Cycle 6: 6-11-4-14-6
- Cycle 7: 7-5-9-10-7
- Cycle 8: 9-5-8-14-9
- Cycle 9: 10-1-8-5-10
- Cycle 10: 11-4-14-8-11
- Cycle 11: 12-3-10-7-12
- Cycle 12: 13-6-11-4-13

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges) are:
- Cycle 1 with chord (1, 10)
- Cycle 2 with chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 3 with chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 4 with chord (10, 3)
- Cycle 5 with chord (8, 9) 
- Cycle 6 with chord (11, 14)
- Cycle 7 with chord (5, 9) 
- Cycle 8 with chord (5, 14)
- Cycle 9 with chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 10 with chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 11 with chord (3, 7)
- Cycle 12 with chord (6, 4)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [12].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 1, 10, 3, (1, 10)>
<1, 8, 14, 4, (8, 4)>
<2, 4, 14, 9, (4, 9)>
<3, 4, 11, 10, (10, 3)>
<5, 8, 14, 9, (8, 9)>
<6, 11, 4, 14, (11, 14)>
<7, 5, 9, 10, (5, 9)>
<9, 5, 8, 14, (5, 14)>
<10, 1, 8, 5, (1, 8)>
<11, 4, 14, 8, (4, 8)>
<12, 3, 10, 7, (3, 7)>
<13, 6, 11, 4, (6, 4)>
