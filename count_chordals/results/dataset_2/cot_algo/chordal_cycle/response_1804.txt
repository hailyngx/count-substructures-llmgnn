Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 13) (11, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 10) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 1) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 13) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (2, 6, 8, 5)
- Cycle 2: (2, 6, 7, 10)
- Cycle 3: (2, 6, 9, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 6, 8, 0)
- Cycle 5: (2, 6, 8, 12)
- Cycle 6: (2, 6, 8, 0, 3)
- Cycle 7: (2, 6, 7, 10, 13)
- Cycle 8: (5, 8, 6, 9)
- Cycle 9: (5, 8, 6, 7)
- Cycle 10: (5, 8, 12, 9)
- Cycle 11: (5, 8, 12, 14)
- Cycle 12: (5, 4, 9, 6)
- Cycle 13: (5, 4, 1, 9)
- Cycle 14: (5, 4, 1, 7)
- Cycle 15: (5, 4, 13, 10)
- Cycle 16: (5, 10, 0, 8)
- Cycle 17: (5, 10, 0, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <2, (6, 8), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (8, 6), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (8, 12), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (4, 9), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (4, 1), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, (10, 0), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
