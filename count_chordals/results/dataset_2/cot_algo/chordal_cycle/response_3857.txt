- Cycle 7: (9, 5, 7, 10, 1, 6, 12, 9)
- Cycle 8: (6, 1, 10, 14, 4, 11, 13, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 4, 14, 10, 1, 8, 12, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 13, 11, 4, 8, 12, 3, 6)
- Cycle 11: (10, 5, 7, 8, 3, 12, 6, 1, 10)
- Cycle 12: (4, 6, 13, 0, 10, 1, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 11, 13, 0, 10, 14, 4)
- Cycle 14: (8, 4, 2, 7, 10, 0, 13, 6, 12, 8)
- Cycle 15: (0, 10, 7, 8, 4, 11, 13, 0)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 12, 6, 5) <(9, 6)>
- Cycle 2: (5, 10, 1, 6, 5) <(1, 10)>
- Cycle 3: (5, 14, 4, 6, 5) <(14, 4)>
- Cycle 4: (5, 13, 6, 1, 10, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 7, 10, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 3, 8, 4, 6, 5)
- Cycle 7: (9, 5, 7, 10, 1, 6, 12, 9) <(5, 10)>
- Cycle 8: (6, 1, 10, 14, 4, 11, 13, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 4, 14, 10, 1, 8, 12, 6) <(4, 10)>
- Cycle 10: (6, 13, 11, 4, 8, 12, 3, 6)
- Cycle 11: (10, 5, 7, 8, 3, 12, 6, 1, 10)
- Cycle 12: (4, 6, 13, 0, 10, 1, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 11, 13, 0, 10, 14, 4) <(11, 10)>
- Cycle 14: (8, 4, 2, 7, 10, 0, 13, 6, 12, 8)
- Cycle 15: (0, 10, 7, 8, 4, 11, 13, 0)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (9, 6)>
