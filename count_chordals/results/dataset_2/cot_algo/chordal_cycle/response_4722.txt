Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 4) (15, 11) (8, 2) (8, 17) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 18) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 15) (11, 7) (0, 10) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 16) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (5, 13) (5, 4) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 17) (1, 6) (1, 19) (6, 1) (6, 18) (6, 16) (19, 13) (19, 1) (19, 12) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 18) (17, 8) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 4) (4, 15) (4, 14) (4, 5) (4, 17) (9, 10) (9, 17) (18, 13) (18, 6) (18, 16) (18, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 4, 14, 2, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 11, 7, 3)
- Cycle 3: (8, 2, 14, 4, 15, 8)
- Cycle 4: (13, 5, 4, 15, 13)
- Cycle 5: (13, 5, 4, 17, 13)
- Cycle 6: (13, 5, 4, 14, 2, 13)
- Cycle 7: (13, 19, 1, 6, 16, 14, 2, 13)
- Cycle 8: (13, 19, 12, 3, 15, 11, 7, 17, 9, 10, 14, 2, 13)
- Cycle 9: (13, 18, 6, 16, 14, 4, 17, 7, 11, 15, 13)
- Cycle 10: (10, 0, 14, 4, 15, 11, 7, 17, 9, 10)
- Cycle 11: (10, 2, 8, 17, 7, 11, 15, 13, 5, 4, 14, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 15), 10, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (3, 15), 11, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (8, 2), 4, 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (13, 5), 4, 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (13, 5), 4, 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (13, 5), 4, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (13, 19), 6, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (13, 19), 12, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (13, 18), 6, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, (10, 0), 14, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <11, (10, 2), 8, 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [11]
