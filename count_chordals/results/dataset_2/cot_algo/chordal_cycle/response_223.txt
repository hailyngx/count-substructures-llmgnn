Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:  
- Cycle 1: 2-5-4-7-2
- Cycle 2: 6-5-4-6
- Cycle 3: 7-4-6-7
- Cycle 4: 0-9-3-0
- Cycle 5: 0-9-7-1-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the cycles listed above, only the cycle 0-9-3-0 has exactly one chord, which is the edge (9,3).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found in this graph with exactly one chord, so the final answer is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0,9,3,0, (9,3)>.
