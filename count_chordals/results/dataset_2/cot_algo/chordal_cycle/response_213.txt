Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 1-5-7-4-1
        - Cycle 2: 1-5-6-3-1
        - Cycle 3: 1-9-8-3-1
        - Cycle 4: 1-7-4-8-1
        - Cycle 5: 1-3-0-4-1
        - Cycle 6: 2-9-8-3-2
        - Cycle 7: 2-3-0-4-2
        - Cycle 8: 2-7-4-8-2
        - Cycle 9: 3-0-4-7-3
        - Cycle 10: 3-1-5-6-3
        - Cycle 11: 4-0-3-8-4
        - Cycle 12: 4-7-5-1-4
        - Cycle 13: 5-6-1-7-5
        - Cycle 14: 7-5-6-1-7
        - Cycle 15: 8-4-0-3-8
        - Cycle 16: 9-1-5-7-9
        - Cycle 17: 9-2-4-7-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - The cycle 1-5-7-4-1 has a chord 5-4.
        - The cycle 1-5-6-3-1 has a chord 5-3.
        - The cycle 1-9-8-3-1 has a chord 9-3.
        - The cycle 1-7-4-8-1 has a chord 7-8.
        - The cycle 1-3-0-4-1 has a chord 3-0.
        - The cycle 2-9-8-3-2 has a chord 9-3.
        - The cycle 2-3-0-4-2 has a chord 3-0.
        - The cycle 2-7-4-8-2 has a chord 7-8.
        - The cycle 3-0-4-7-3 has a chord 0-4.
        - The cycle 4-0-3-8-4 has a chord 0-3.
        - The cycle 9-1-5-7-9 has a chord 1-7.
        - The cycle 9-2-4-7-9 has a chord 2-4.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found: [5].

        Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <1, (5, 4), 7)>
        <1, (5, 3), 6)>
        <1, (9, 3), 8)>
        <1, (7, 8), 4)>
        <1, (3, 0), 4)>
