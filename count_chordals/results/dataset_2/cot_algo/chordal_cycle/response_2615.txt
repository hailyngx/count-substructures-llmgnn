Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

    - Cycle 1: <6, 9, 1, 4, 7>
    - Cycle 2: <6, 9, 1, 3, 2>
    - Cycle 3: <6, 9, 2, 4, 1>
    - Cycle 4: <6, 14, 9, 1, 7>
    - Cycle 5: <6, 14, 9, 2, 3>
    - Cycle 6: <6, 14, 7, 4, 1>
    - Cycle 7: <6, 3, 1, 4, 7>
    - Cycle 8: <6, 3, 1, 7, 12>
    - Cycle 9: <6, 3, 2, 4, 1>
    - Cycle 10: <6, 8, 9, 1, 7>
    - Cycle 11: <6, 8, 9, 2, 3>
    - Cycle 12: <6, 8, 2, 4, 1>
    - Cycle 13: <9, 6, 8, 2, 3>
    - Cycle 14: <9, 6, 8, 14, 7>
    - Cycle 15: <9, 1, 4, 7, 12>
    - Cycle 16: <9, 1, 3, 5, 10>
    - Cycle 17: <9, 2, 3, 12, 14>
    - Cycle 18: <1, 9, 2, 4, 7>
    - Cycle 19: <1, 9, 6, 14, 7>
    - Cycle 20: <1, 9, 6, 3, 2>
    - Cycle 21: <1, 3, 2, 4, 7>
    - Cycle 22: <1, 3, 6, 8, 2>
    - Cycle 23: <1, 3, 5, 10, 11>
    - Cycle 24: <1, 4, 2, 8, 14>
    - Cycle 25: <1, 4, 7, 14, 12>
    - Cycle 26: <1, 7, 4, 2, 3>
    - Cycle 27: <1, 7, 12, 0, 11>
    - Cycle 28: <6, 3, 2, 8, 14>
    - Cycle 29: <6, 8, 14, 12, 0>
    - Cycle 30: <6, 14, 12, 0, 13>
    - Cycle 31: <9, 1, 7, 12, 14>
    - Cycle 32: <9, 2, 8, 14, 12>
    - Cycle 33: <7, 1, 4, 2, 3>
    - Cycle 34: <7, 1, 9, 6, 8>
    - Cycle 35: <7, 4, 2, 8, 14>
    - Cycle 36: <7, 4, 1, 9, 6>
    - Cycle 37: <7, 11, 0, 12, 14>
    - Cycle 38: <10, 5, 3, 2, 8>
    - Cycle 39: <10, 5, 0, 12, 14>
    - Cycle 40: <11, 0, 12, 14, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

    - Chordal 4-cycles found:
    [<6, 9, 1, 4, 7>]
    [<6, 14, 9, 2, 3>]
    [<6, 3, 1, 7, 12>]
    [<6, 8, 9, 2, 3>]
    [<9, 1, 4, 7, 12>]
    [<1, 3, 2, 4, 7>]
    [<1, 7, 4, 2, 3>]
    [<1, 7, 12, 0, 11>]
    [<9, 2, 8, 14, 12>]
    [<7, 4, 2, 8, 14>]
    [<10, 5, 0, 12, 14>]

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles is [0].
