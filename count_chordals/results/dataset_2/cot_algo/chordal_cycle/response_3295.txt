Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 9) (1, 3) (3, 17) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (8, 2) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 15) (2, 8) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 16) (18, 6) (18, 12) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 9) (6, 18) (6, 19) (0, 16) (16, 18) (16, 0) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 10) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 15) (5, 14) (5, 3) (5, 12) (9, 17) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 15) (15, 13) (15, 7) (15, 11) (15, 9) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 19) (19, 6) (19, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
        - Cycle 1: (3, 17, 13, 15, 3)
        - Cycle 2: (2, 8, 2)
        - Cycle 3: (4, 14, 5, 3, 4)
        - Cycle 4: (4, 12, 5, 14, 4)
        - Cycle 5: (9, 17, 13, 11, 9)
        - Cycle 6: (10, 14, 4, 12, 10)
        - Cycle 7: (10, 19, 6, 18, 10)
        - Cycle 8: (15, 13, 17, 3, 15)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (13, 3)
        - Cycle 2 does not have exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 3 does not have exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (5, 12)
        - Cycle 5 does not have exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (4, 12)
        - Cycle 7 has exactly one chord: (6, 19)
        - Cycle 8 has exactly one chord: (13, 17)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <1, (13, 3), 15>
        <4, (5, 12), 14>
        <6, (4, 12), 10>
        <7, (6, 19), 18>
