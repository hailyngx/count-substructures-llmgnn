Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 12) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 10) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 13) (1, 12) (1, 11) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 12) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 2, 6, 13, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 6, 13, 5)
- Cycle 4: (4, 13, 12, 2, 4)
- Cycle 5: (2, 8, 0, 7, 9, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 4, 14, 11, 1, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 4, 14, 10, 12, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 6, 3, 13, 12, 2)
- Cycle 9: (6, 3, 13, 4, 5, 6)
- Cycle 10: (13, 6, 2, 8, 0, 13)
- Cycle 11: (13, 6, 2, 4, 5, 13)
- Cycle 12: (4, 14, 11, 9, 5, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 13, 3, 6, 2, 4)
- Cycle 14: (13, 12, 10, 14, 4, 13)
- Cycle 15: (12, 2, 4, 5, 10, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: <4, 5, (13, 2), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
