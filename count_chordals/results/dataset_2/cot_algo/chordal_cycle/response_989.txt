Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 19) (9, 18) (9, 12) (14, 19) (17, 8) (17, 15) (4, 12) (4, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 1) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 15) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 1) (18, 6) (18, 9) (18, 15) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 3) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 0) (1, 16) (1, 8) (1, 12) (0, 13) (0, 19) (10, 6) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 3) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 5) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-16-3-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-16-8-17-1
- Cycle 3: 1-12-7-15-1
- Cycle 4: 1-12-9-18-1
- Cycle 5: 1-12-4-2-1
- Cycle 6: 3-13-0-19-3

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chord (16, 5)
- Cycle 2: Chord (8, 17)
- Cycle 3: Chord (12, 7)
- Cycle 4: Chord (9, 18)
- Cycle 5: Chord (4, 2)
- Cycle 6: Chord (13, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (16, 5)>
<1, (8, 17)>
<1, (12, 7)>
<1, (9, 18)>
<1, (4, 2)>
<3, (13, 19)>
