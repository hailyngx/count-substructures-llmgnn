Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-5-2-1
- Cycle 2: 4-5-3-4
- Cycle 3: 1-6-4-9-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-5-2-1
- Cycle 5: 3-9-8-5-3
- Cycle 6: 5-8-7-0-5
- Cycle 7: 7-1-5-8-7

Step 2:
Among these cycles, only Cycle 3: 1-6-4-9-1 has exactly one chord (6-9).

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

The unique chordal 4-cycle is <1, 6, 9, 4> with the chord (6, 9).
