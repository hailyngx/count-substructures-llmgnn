Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 0-3-6-9-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-8-7-9-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-2-1-9-0
- Cycle 4: 0-6-9-7-8-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <0, 3, 6, 9, 5, 0> has one chord: (0, 9)
- <0, 3, 8, 7, 9, 0> has one chord: (3, 7)
- <0, 5, 2, 1, 9, 0> has one chord: (5, 1)
- <0, 6, 9, 7, 8, 0> has one chord: (6, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
