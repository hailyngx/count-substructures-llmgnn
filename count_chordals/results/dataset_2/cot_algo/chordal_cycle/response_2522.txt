- Cycle 25: (16, 20, 27, 8)
- Cycle 26: (16, 21, 1, 25)
- Cycle 27: (20, 29, 18, 13)

- Cycle 34: (4, 24, 27, 8)
- Cycle 35: (6, 12, 17, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 16, (0, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 19, (28, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 8, (15, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 13, (18, 20)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <13, 24, (4, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <8, 27, (24, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <27, 20, (29, 18)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <27, 12, (6, 22)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, 17, (28, 26)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <16, 20, (29, 18)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <16, 20, (27, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <16, 21, (1, 25)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <20, 29, (18, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <20, 29, (27, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <20, 18, (13, 21)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <24, 4, (6, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <2, 14, (19, 21)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <2, 14, (10, 16)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <4, 24, (13, 21)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 20: <4, 24, (27, 8)>

Step 3: There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [20].
