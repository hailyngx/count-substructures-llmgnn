Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (10, 17) (10, 9) (17, 13) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 12) (4, 13) (4, 15) (18, 9) (18, 3) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (5, 15) (5, 14) (19, 7) (19, 3) (19, 16) (19, 6) (15, 8) (15, 4) (15, 5) (15, 11) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 1) (1, 8) (1, 16) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 1) (6, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 17) (12, 2) (12, 9) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 12) (9, 11) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 19) (14, 7) (14, 5) (11, 15) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 8 - 13 - 4 - 15 - 8
- Cycle 2: 8 - 6 - 1 - 16 - 8
- Cycle 3: 13 - 17 - 10 - 9 - 13
- Cycle 4: 4 - 15 - 5 - 14 - 4
- Cycle 5: 18 - 9 - 12 - 17 - 18
- Cycle 6: 0 - 7 - 14 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 7: 19 - 6 - 1 - 16 - 19

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: Chord between 8 and 4
- Cycle 2: Chord between 1 and 8
- Cycle 3: Chord between 13 and 9
- Cycle 4: Chord between 15 and 5
- Cycle 5: Chord between 9 and 12
- Cycle 6: Chord between 7 and 14
- Cycle 7: Chord between 6 and 16

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, we have 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [0].
