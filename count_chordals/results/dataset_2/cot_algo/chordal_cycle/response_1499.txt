Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-2-4-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-4-8-0
- Cycle 3: 1-4-8-9-1
- Cycle 4: 1-4-2-5-1
- Cycle 5: 2-4-8-9-2
- Cycle 6: 3-0-5-2-3
- Cycle 7: 3-8-4-6-3
- Cycle 8: 4-8-3-0-4
- Cycle 9: 6-4-0-3-6
- Cycle 10: 8-4-6-7-8

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Two chords found: (2, 4)
- Cycle 2: One chord found: (4, 8)
- Cycle 3: No chord found
- Cycle 4: No chord found
- Cycle 5: One chord found: (4, 8)
- Cycle 6: No chord found
- Cycle 7: No chord found
- Cycle 8: No chord found
- Cycle 9: No chord found
- Cycle 10: No chord found

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (4, 8), 9>
- <2, (4, 8), 5>
