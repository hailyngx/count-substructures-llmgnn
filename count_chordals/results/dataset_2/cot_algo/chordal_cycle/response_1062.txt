Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 20) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 4) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 25) (5, 21) (9, 5) (9, 1) (22, 23) (22, 26) (23, 22) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 28) (18, 28) (18, 29) (8, 4) (8, 25) (8, 21) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 8) (28, 23) (28, 18) (28, 29) (28, 21) (29, 18) (29, 28) (29, 27) (29, 11) (21, 5) (21, 8) (21, 28) (21, 12) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 27) (1, 9) (1, 24) (0, 3) (0, 23) (0, 10) (0, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (10, 3) (10, 0) (6, 15) (6, 0) (6, 27) (24, 1) (25, 17) (25, 5) (25, 8) (25, 13) (11, 29) (27, 3) (27, 29) (27, 26) (27, 6) (16, 23) (16, 19) (20, 3) (20, 26) (20, 13) (2, 14) (2, 19) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 2) (19, 13) (13, 15) (13, 7) (13, 25) (13, 20) (13, 19) (12, 5) (12, 21) 

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <3, 15, 6, 0, 3>
- Cycle 2: <3, 20, 26, 22, 3>
- Cycle 3: <3, 27, 29, 18, 3>
- Cycle 4: <15, 6, 27, 26, 15>
- Cycle 5: <15, 13, 25, 17, 15>
- Cycle 6: <14, 17, 25, 8, 14>
- Cycle 7: <5, 9, 1, 24, 5>
- Cycle 8: <5, 25, 17, 4, 5>
- Cycle 9: <9, 1, 24, 29, 9>
- Cycle 10: <22, 26, 27, 29, 22>
- Cycle 11: <23, 28, 29, 27, 23>
- Cycle 12: <28, 21, 12, 5, 28>
- Cycle 13: <21, 12, 5, 25, 21>
- Cycle 14: <26, 27, 29, 11, 26>
- Cycle 15: <1, 9, 5, 25, 1>
- Cycle 16: <0, 3, 15, 6, 0>
- Cycle 17: <0, 23, 28, 21, 0>
- Cycle 18: <7, 19, 16, 23, 7>
- Cycle 19: <6, 15, 27, 29, 6>
- Cycle 20: <24, 1, 9, 5, 24>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, (6, 15), 0, 3>
- <3, 20, (26, 22), 3>
- <3, 27, (29, 18), 3>
- <15, (6, 27), 26, 15>
- <15, 13, (25, 17), 15>
- <14, (17, 25), 8, 14>
- <5, 9, (1, 24), 5>
- <5, 25, (17, 4), 5>
- <9, 1, (24, 29), 9>
- <22, (26, 27), 29, 22>
- <23, 28, (29, 27), 23>
- <28, (21, 12), 5, 28>
- <21, 12, (5, 25), 21>
- <26, 27, (29, 11), 26>
- <1, 9, (5, 25), 1>
- <0, 3, (15, 6), 0>
- <0, 23, (28, 21), 0>
- <7, 19, (16, 23), 7>
- <6, 15, (27, 29), 6>
- <24, 1, (9, 5), 24>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [20]
