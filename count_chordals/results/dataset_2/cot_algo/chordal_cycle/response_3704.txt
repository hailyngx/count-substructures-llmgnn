Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 6) (16, 11) (16, 0) (3, 15) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (7, 15) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 18) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 11) (6, 5) (6, 1) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 17) (10, 15) (10, 12) (13, 17) (13, 0) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 18) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 18) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 8) (14, 11) (14, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (18, 12) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 8) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 17) (2, 9) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-13-17-19-5-6-11-16-0
- Cycle 2: 1-5-6-11-16-0-13-17-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-11-16-0-13-17-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-5-19-17-13-0-16-1
- Cycle 5: 1-4-12-18-17-13-0-16-1
- Cycle 6: 2-5-6-11-16-0-13-17-2
- Cycle 7: 2-5-1-6-11-16-0-13-2
- Cycle 8: 2-9-4-12-18-17-13-0-2
- Cycle 9: 2-9-4-1-6-11-16-0-2
- Cycle 10: 4-1-6-11-16-0-13-17-4

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (0, 16), (5, 6)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (6, 11)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (6, 11)
- Cycle 4 has 2 chords: (1, 5), (13, 17)
- Cycle 5 has 2 chords: (1, 18), (4, 12)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (6, 11)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (5, 1)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (4, 12)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (4, 1)
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (4, 1)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, (5, 6)>
<1, (6, 11)>
<4, (1, 5)>
<5, (1, 18)>
<6, (4, 12)>
