Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 8, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 2, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 9, 2, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 2, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 6, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 4, 0, 7, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 2, 7, 4, 0, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 6, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 10: (2, 7, 0, 4, 2)

Step 2:
Checking for one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (5, 8), 2>
- Cycle 2: <1, (2, 9), 3>
- Cycle 3: <1, (3, 2), 9>
- Cycle 4: <1, (2, 7), 3>
- Cycle 5: <1, (4, 7), 3>
- Cycle 6: <1, (6, 7), 3>
- Cycle 7: <1, (4, 0), 7>
- Cycle 8: <1, (2, 7), 4>
- Cycle 9: <1, (6, 7), 0>
- Cycle 10: <2, (4, 0), 7>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (5, 8), 2>
<1, (2, 9), 3>
<1, (3, 2), 9>
<1, (2, 7), 3>
<1, (4, 7), 3>
<1, (6, 7), 3>
<1, (4, 0), 7>
<1, (2, 7), 4>
<1, (6, 7), 0>
<2, (4, 0), 7>
