Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 6, 5, 2, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 1, 8, 9, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 0, 7, 2, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 2, 5, 6, 7)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 0, 4, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 1, 4, 2, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 3, 8, 1, 5)
- Cycle 8: (6, 0, 2, 7, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 1, 4, 5, 6)
- Cycle 10: (2, 0, 4, 9, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 7, 0, 6, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 5, 1, 4, 2)
- Cycle 13: (8, 9, 0, 1, 8)
- Cycle 14: (8, 3, 5, 2, 8)
- Cycle 15: (0, 7, 2, 4, 0)
- Cycle 16: (0, 6, 5, 4, 0)
- Cycle 17: (0, 2, 1, 4, 0)
- Cycle 18: (0, 9, 4, 1, 0)
- Cycle 19: (9, 8, 1, 4, 9)
- Cycle 20: (9, 3, 8, 5, 9)
- Cycle 21: (1, 8, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 22: (1, 5, 6, 4, 1)
- Cycle 23: (1, 2, 4, 5, 1)
- Cycle 24: (3, 8, 1, 4, 3)
- Cycle 25: (3, 9, 4, 0, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, (2, 5), 6> has one chord (2, 5)
- <4, (1, 8), 9> has one chord (1, 8)
- <4, (0, 7), 2> has one chord (0, 7)
- <7, (2, 5), 6> has one chord (2, 5)
- <5, (1, 4), 6> has one chord (1, 4)
- <5, (1, 3), 8> has one chord (1, 3)
- <5, (4, 6), 0> has one chord (4, 6)
- <6, (0, 2), 7> has one chord (0, 2)
- <9, (1, 8), 0> has one chord (1, 8)
- <3, (8, 1), 4> has one chord (8, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are [16] chordless cycles in total.
