Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 4) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 13) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 4) (7, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-3-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-10-7-5
- Cycle 3: 5-1-3-6-5
- Cycle 4: 5-1-3-4-5
- Cycle 5: 5-9-6-13-5
- Cycle 6: 9-6-3-1-9
- Cycle 7: 9-6-3-4-9
- Cycle 8: 9-6-0-10-9
- Cycle 9: 6-3-4-13-6
- Cycle 10: 6-3-1-5-6
- Cycle 11: 6-3-4-7-6
- Cycle 12: 3-4-7-10-3
- Cycle 13: 3-4-13-9-3
- Cycle 14: 3-6-9-13-3
- Cycle 15: 1-3-4-7-1
- Cycle 16: 1-3-4-13-1
- Cycle 17: 1-3-6-9-1
- Cycle 18: 1-3-11-14-1
- Cycle 19: 10-7-4-3-10
- Cycle 20: 10-7-4-13-10
- Cycle 21: 10-7-9-6-10
- Cycle 22: 7-4-13-9-7
- Cycle 23: 7-4-3-6-7
- Cycle 24: 7-4-13-6-7
- Cycle 25: 7-4-3-1-7
- Cycle 26: 7-4-3-6-7
- Cycle 27: 7-4-10-12-7
- Cycle 28: 9-13-4-7-9
- Cycle 29: 9-13-4-3-9
- Cycle 30: 9-13-6-3-9
- Cycle 31: 6-9-13-4-6
- Cycle 32: 6-9-13-4-6
- Cycle 33: 6-9-13-3-6
- Cycle 34: 4-3-6-9-4
- Cycle 35: 4-3-1-5-4
- Cycle 36: 4-3-6-9-4
- Cycle 37: 4-3-6-1-4
- Cycle 38: 4-3-1-7-4
- Cycle 39: 10-0-14-12-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, (1, 10), 7>
- <6, (1, 3), 9>
- <9, (1, 6), 5>
- <3, (4, 13), 6>
- <4, (7, 9), 3>
- <7, (4, 10), 7>
- <13, (4, 9), 6>
- <1, (3, 4), 7>
- <10, (0, 14), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [9]
