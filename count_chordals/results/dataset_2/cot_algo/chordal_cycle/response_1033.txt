Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-8-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-7-8-5
- Cycle 3: 5-1-8-6-5
- Cycle 4: 5-1-0-8-5
- Cycle 5: 9-6-8-7-9
- Cycle 6: 9-6-3-2-9
- Cycle 7: 4-7-8-6-4
- Cycle 8: 4-7-3-6-4
- Cycle 9: 7-3-6-8-7
- Cycle 10: 7-3-2-9-7
- Cycle 11: 6-9-2-3-6
- Cycle 12: 8-6-3-2-8
- Cycle 13: 1-5-9-2-1
- Cycle 14: 0-5-9-2-0
- Cycle 15: 0-5-1-7-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <5, 1, 7, 8> has a chord 1-8
- <5, 1, 8, 6> has a chord 1-8
- <5, 1, 0, 8> has a chord 1-8
- <9, 6, 8, 7> has a chord 6-7
- <7, 3, 6, 8> has a chord 3-8
- <0, 5, 9, 2> has a chord 5-9
- <0, 5, 1, 7> has a chord 5-7

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
