Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 2-1-9-6-2
- Cycle 2: 2-1-4-7-2
- Cycle 3: 2-1-3-7-2
- Cycle 4: 2-1-7-4-2
- Cycle 5: 2-1-7-3-2
- Cycle 6: 0-2-1-4-0
- Cycle 7: 0-2-1-9-0
- Cycle 8: 0-2-8-5-0
- Cycle 9: 0-2-1-3-0
- Cycle 10: 0-2-1-7-0
- Cycle 11: 0-5-8-2-0
- Cycle 12: 0-5-3-6-0
- Cycle 13: 0-5-2-1-0
- Cycle 14: 0-5-6-3-0
- Cycle 15: 0-5-2-9-0
- Cycle 16: 0-5-2-7-0
- Cycle 17: 3-1-9-6-3
- Cycle 18: 3-1-7-4-3
- Cycle 19: 3-1-2-5-3
- Cycle 20: 3-1-2-8-3
- Cycle 21: 3-1-4-7-3
- Cycle 22: 3-1-7-2-3
- Cycle 23: 3-1-7-9-3
- Cycle 24: 3-5-6-3
- Cycle 25: 3-5-2-1-3
- Cycle 26: 3-5-2-8-3
- Cycle 27: 3-5-0-5
- Cycle 28: 3-5-0-2-3
- Cycle 29: 3-5-2-7-3
- Cycle 30: 3-5-8-2-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <2, 1, (9, 6)>
- <2, 1, (4, 7)>
- <2, 1, (3, 7)>
- <2, 1, (7, 4)>
- <2, 1, (7, 3)>
- <0, 2, (1, 4)>
- <0, 2, (1, 9)>
- <0, 2, (8, 5)>
- <0, 2, (1, 3)>
- <0, 2, (1, 7)>
- <0, 5, (8, 2)>
- <0, 5, (3, 6)>
- <0, 5, (1, 2)>
- <0, 5, (3, 6)>
- <0, 5, (2, 9)>
- <0, 5, (2, 7)>
- <3, 1, (9, 6)>
- <3, 1, (7, 4)>
- <3, 1, (2, 5)>
- <3, 1, (2, 8)>
- <3, 1, (4, 7)>
- <3, 1, (7, 2)>
- <3, 1, (7, 9)>
- <3, 5, (6, 3)>
- <3, 5, (2, 1)>
- <3, 5, (2, 8)>
- <3, 5, (0, 5)>
- <3, 5, (2, 0)>
- <3, 5, (2, 7)>
- <3, 5, (8, 2)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 30 chordal 4-cycles in the graph: [30].
