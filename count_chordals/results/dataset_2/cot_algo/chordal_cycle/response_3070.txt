Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 13) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 12) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 0) (12, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 4-13-5-1-4
- Cycle 2: 4-12-8-2-4
- Cycle 3: 4-14-7-6-4
- Cycle 4: 7-6-9-13-7
- Cycle 5: 6-2-8-12-6
- Cycle 6: 6-13-9-2-6
- Cycle 7: 9-6-2-1-9
- Cycle 8: 9-13-5-1-9
- Cycle 9: 2-8-0-12-2
- Cycle 10: 2-11-13-5-2
- Cycle 11: 8-12-0-10-8
- Cycle 12: 5-13-9-6-5
- Cycle 13: 5-1-2-6-5
- Cycle 14: 13-3-12-8-13
- Cycle 15: 3-12-4-13-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <4, (1, 13), 5> (Chord: 1-13)
- <4, (8, 12), 2> (Chord: 8-12)
- <4, (7, 6), 14> (Chord: 7-6)
- <7, (6, 9), 13> (Chord: 6-9)
- <6, (8, 12), 2> (Chord: 8-12)
- <6, (9, 2), 13> (Chord: 9-2)
- <9, (6, 2), 1> (Chord: 6-2)
- <9, (13, 5), 1> (Chord: 13-5)
- <2, (8, 0), 12> (Chord: 8-0)
- <2, (11, 13), 5> (Chord: 11-13)
- <8, (12, 0), 10> (Chord: 12-0)
- <5, (13, 9), 6> (Chord: 13-9)
- <5, (1, 2), 6> (Chord: 1-2)
- <13, (3, 12), 8> (Chord: 3-12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so [14].
