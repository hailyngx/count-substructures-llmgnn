Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 4) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 11) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 4) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 9) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 1) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (0, 6, 5, 0)
- (0, 7, 1, 8, 13, 3, 0)
- (0, 7, 1, 14, 9, 11, 10, 0)
- (0, 7, 10, 12, 13, 3, 2, 0)
- (0, 10, 11, 9, 14, 2, 0)
- (1, 7, 0, 6, 5, 3, 13, 4, 1)
- (1, 7, 0, 6, 5, 3, 2, 14, 1)
- (1, 7, 0, 10, 11, 13, 3, 2, 14, 1)
- (1, 7, 0, 10, 12, 13, 3, 2, 14, 1)
- (1, 9, 11, 10, 7, 0, 6, 5, 3, 13, 1)
- (1, 9, 11, 13, 3, 2, 14, 1)
- (1, 14, 2, 0, 6, 5, 3, 13, 4, 1)
- (1, 14, 2, 0, 7, 10, 11, 9, 1)
- (2, 0, 6, 5, 3, 13, 4, 14, 2)
- (2, 0, 7, 1, 14, 9, 11, 10, 12, 13, 3, 2)
- (2, 3, 13, 4, 1, 7, 10, 11, 9, 14, 2)
- (3, 13, 4, 1, 7, 10, 11, 9, 14, 2, 3)
- (4, 13, 3, 2, 14, 1, 7, 10, 12, 11, 9, 4)
- (5, 0, 6, 5)
- (5, 3, 2, 14, 1, 7, 0, 10, 11, 13, 5)
- (6, 0, 7, 10, 11, 13, 3, 5)
- (7, 0, 6, 5, 3, 13, 4, 14, 9, 11, 10, 7)
- (9, 1, 7, 0, 6, 5, 3, 13, 4, 14, 2, 9)
- (9, 1, 14, 2, 3, 13, 4, 1)
- (9, 11, 13, 3, 2, 14, 1, 7, 10, 12, 11, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
- <1, (14, 2), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Final count: [26]
