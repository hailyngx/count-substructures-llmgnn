Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 18) (11, 8) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 16) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 18) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 3) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 9) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 17) (19, 7) (19, 1) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 9) (2, 12) (3, 16) (3, 4) (3, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 18) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (18, 11) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 13) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 9) (13, 18) (8, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 0-11-8-11-0
        - Cycle 2: 3-16-5-4-3
        - Cycle 3: 4-7-12-6-4
        - Cycle 4: 4-10-6-12-4
        - Cycle 5: 5-16-7-4-5
        - Cycle 6: 7-12-18-11-7
        - Cycle 7: 9-14-13-18-9
        - Cycle 8: 9-15-17-5-9
        - Cycle 9: 10-4-7-19-10
        - Cycle 10: 11-18-12-6-11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - From Cycle 3: 4-7-12-6-4 has one chord 7-6
        - From Cycle 4: 4-10-6-12-4 has one chord 10-12
        - From Cycle 6: 7-12-18-11-7 has one chord 12-11

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [7]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles: 
        - <0, 11, 8, 11>
        - <3, 16, 5, 4>
        - <9, 14, 13, 18>
        - <9, 15, 17, 5>
        - <11, 18, 12, 6>
        - <4, 7, 12, 6>
        - <4, 10, 6, 12>
