- Cycle 3: 5-3-1-6-5
- Cycle 4: 5-3-14-1-5
- Cycle 5: 5-7-12-9-5
- Cycle 6: 5-13-9-12-5
- Cycle 7: 1-6-9-5-1
- Cycle 8: 1-3-5-7-1
- Cycle 9: 1-14-3-5-1
- Cycle 10: 3-5-9-12-3
- Cycle 11: 3-14-1-6-3
- Cycle 12: 3-11-7-12-3
- Cycle 13: 7-5-9-13-7
- Cycle 14: 7-1-3-11-7
- Cycle 15: 12-9-5-7-12
- Cycle 16: 12-7-1-14-12
- Cycle 17: 12-10-3-14-12
- Cycle 18: 0-14-4-11-0

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (9, 6), 5>
- Cycle 2: <2, (12, 7), 5>
- Cycle 3: <3, (3, 1), 5>
- Cycle 4: <4, (14, 1), 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, (5, 7), 12>
- Cycle 6: <6, (9, 12), 5>
- Cycle 7: <7, (1, 9), 6>
- Cycle 8: <8, (3, 7), 1>
- Cycle 9: <9, (5, 3), 1>
- Cycle 10: [10]
- Cycle 11: [11]
- Cycle 12: [12]
- Cycle 13: <13, (13, 9), 5>
- Cycle 14: [14]
- Cycle 15: [15]
- Cycle 16: [16]
- Cycle 17: [17]
- Cycle 18: <18, (14, 4), 0>
- Cycle 19: <19, (11, 3), 0>
- Cycle 20: <20, (8, 11), 0>

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
