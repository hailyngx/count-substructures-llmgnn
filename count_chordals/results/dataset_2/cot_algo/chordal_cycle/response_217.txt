Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 16) (2, 7) (4, 18) (4, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 12) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 18) (1, 5) (1, 17) (17, 0) (17, 1) (17, 15) (10, 15) (10, 19) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 6) (16, 2) (16, 0) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 6) (11, 13) (11, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (9, 2) (9, 15) (9, 12) (3, 8) (3, 12) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 9) (12, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 18, 7, 2, 5, 13, 11>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 18, 11, 13, 6, 15, 9>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 18, 11, 13, 6, 14, 12>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (4, 13)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (18, 6)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (18, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
