Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 14) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 11) (15, 16) (6, 7) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 2) (9, 16) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 13) (11, 15) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 12) (17, 3) (17, 1) (17, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (8, 0) (8, 18) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 5) (4, 1) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 5) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 5) (19, 4) (19, 12) (12, 11) (12, 19) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 1) (7, 6) (7, 17) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph.
        - (1, 4, 5, 1) is a 4-cycle.
        - (7, 17, 1, 7) is a 4-cycle.
        - (9, 16, 1, 9) is a 4-cycle.
        - (10, 13, 6, 10) is a 4-cycle.
        - (11, 12, 19, 11) is a 4-cycle.
        - (15, 10, 13, 15) is a 4-cycle.
        - (15, 16, 1, 15) is a 4-cycle.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Only the cycle (9, 16, 1, 9) has exactly one chord, which is the edge (16, 1).
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There is 1 chordless 4-cycle found, which is <9, 16, 1, 15>.

Therefore, in this graph, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
