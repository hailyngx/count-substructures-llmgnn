Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 3) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 3) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 17) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 13) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 14) (13, 5) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 16) (8, 0) (8, 19) (8, 17) (8, 6) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 10) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 9) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 16) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 17) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 15) (11, 7) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 9) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 9) (15, 4) (15, 7) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: 
    - There are two cycles of length 4 in the graph: (0, 14, 13, 5, 0) and (4, 19, 16, 12, 4).
    
Step 2:
    - The cycle (0, 14, 13, 5, 0) has a chord (14, 5).
    - The cycle (4, 19, 16, 12, 4) does not have any chords.
    
Step 3:
    - There is only one chordless cycle found, which is (4, 19, 16, 12, 4).
    
Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <4, 19, 16, 12>.
