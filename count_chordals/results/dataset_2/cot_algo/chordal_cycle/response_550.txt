Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 1) (14, 18) (1, 0) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 12) (17, 1) (17, 2) (13, 4) (13, 7) (12, 1) (12, 16) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 5) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 5) (5, 16) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 15) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 18) (8, 7) (6, 19) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 18) (9, 1) (9, 16) (9, 11) (9, 7) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 18) (10, 12) (10, 3) (18, 14) (18, 8) (18, 15) (18, 3) (18, 11) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (7, 9) (19, 6) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <0, 1, 12, 8, 0>
        - Cycle 2: <1, 9, 16, 2, 1>
        - Cycle 3: <1, 9, 16, 5, 1>
        - Cycle 4: <1, 12, 16, 2, 1>
        - Cycle 5: <1, 12, 3, 18, 1>
        - Cycle 6: <1, 17, 2, 16, 1>
        - Cycle 7: <2, 5, 15, 0, 2>
        - Cycle 8: <2, 5, 8, 0, 2>
        - Cycle 9: <2, 16, 9, 1, 2>
        - Cycle 10: <3, 10, 12, 1, 3>
        - Cycle 11: <3, 10, 18, 11, 3>
        - Cycle 12: <4, 11, 18, 3, 4>
        - Cycle 13: <4, 11, 9, 1, 4>
        - Cycle 14: <5, 8, 12, 1, 5>
        - Cycle 15: <5, 8, 18, 15, 5>
        - Cycle 16: <7, 8, 12, 1, 7>
        - Cycle 17: <7, 8, 5, 2, 7>
        - Cycle 18: <7, 9, 1, 12, 7>
        - Cycle 19: <7, 13, 4, 11, 7>
        - Cycle 20: <8, 0, 15, 5, 8>
        - Cycle 21: <8, 12, 1, 0, 8>
        - Cycle 22: <8, 12, 3, 18, 8>
        - Cycle 23: <8, 18, 11, 9, 8>
        - Cycle 24: <9, 1, 17, 2, 9>
        - Cycle 25: <9, 7, 8, 12, 9>
        - Cycle 26: <9, 11, 18, 15, 9>
        - Cycle 27: <10, 12, 1, 3, 10>
        - Cycle 28: <11, 4, 13, 7, 11>
        - Cycle 29: <11, 18, 15, 5, 11>
        - Cycle 30: <13, 4, 11, 9, 13>
        - Cycle 31: <15, 0, 8, 18, 15>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        Looking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord <1, 12> 
        - Cycle 2 has a chord <9, 16> 
        - Cycle 3 has a chord <16, 5> 
        - Cycle 5 has a chord <12, 3> 
        - Cycle 7 has a chord <5, 15> 
        - Cycle 10 has a chord <12, 1> 
        - Cycle 11 has a chord <10, 18> 
        - Cycle 14 has a chord <8, 12>
        - Cycle 15 has a chord <5, 18>
        - Cycle 16 has a chord <8, 2>
        - Cycle 18 has a chord <1, 12>
        - Cycle 20 has a chord <0, 5>
        - Cycle 25 has a chord <12, 8>
        - Cycle 26 has a chord <18, 9>
        - Cycle 27 has a chord <1, 3>
        - Cycle 28 has a chord <4, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 15 cycles with exactly one chord.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [15].
