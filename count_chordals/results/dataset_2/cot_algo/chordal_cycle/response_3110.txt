Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 6) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 13) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 5) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all edges existing are:
1. <0, 9, 14, 2>
2. <0, 4, 8, 13>
3. <1, 13, 6, 11>
4. <2, 3, 10, 14>
5. <3, 4, 1, 13>
6. <3, 7, 11, 6>
7. <4, 8, 10, 0>
8. <5, 1, 4, 3>
9. <5, 7, 11, 9>
10. <7, 3, 10, 14>
11. <8, 3, 2, 12>
12. <9, 1, 13, 6>
13. <9, 11, 7, 5>
14. <10, 0, 4, 8>
15. <13, 1, 5, 12>

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges):
1. <0, 4, 8, 13> has one chord (4, 13)
2. <2, 3, 10, 14> has one chord (3, 10)
3. <3, 7, 11, 6> has one chord (7, 6)
4. <4, 8, 10, 0> has one chord (8, 10)
5. <5, 1, 4, 3> has one chord (1, 3)
6. <5, 7, 11, 9> has one chord (7, 9)
7. <7, 3, 10, 14> has one chord (3, 10)
8. <13, 1, 5, 12> has one chord (1, 5)

Step 3:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].
