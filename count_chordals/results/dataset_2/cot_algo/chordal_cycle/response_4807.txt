Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles found:
<6, 9, 1, 7, 6> with chord (6, 28)
<6, 28, 25, 29, 6> with chord (6, 10)
<9, 1, 22, 21, 9> with chord (9, 8)
<9, 1, 7, 24, 9> with chord (9, 8)
<1, 3, 29, 14, 1> with chord (1, 22)
<3, 10, 19, 26, 3> with chord (3, 17)
<5, 12, 11, 22, 5> with chord (5, 0)
<5, 0, 26, 19, 5> with chord (5, 16)
<16, 21, 22, 11, 16> with chord (16, 2)
<23, 18, 13, 27, 23> with chord (23, 27)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [20] chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
