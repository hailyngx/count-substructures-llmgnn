        - Cycle 20: 11-9-8-2-11
        - Cycle 21: 11-13-4-3-11
        - Cycle 22: 11-14-6-2-11
        - Cycle 23: 14-6-12-10-14
        - Cycle 24: 1-7-9-11-1
        - Cycle 25: 1-5-2-13-1
        - Cycle 26: 0-9-11-13-0
        - Cycle 27: 3-6-12-10-3
        - Cycle 28: 3-5-2-8-3
        - Cycle 29: 3-0-9-10-3
        - Cycle 30: 10-7-13-4-10

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - <6, (9, 11), 0>
        - <6, (9, 10), 8>
        - <6, (9, 7), 10>
        - <6, (9, 8), 10>
        - <6, (12, 10), 8>
        - <9, (10, 7), 13>
        - <9, (11, 13), 7>
        - <9, (11, 14), 6>
        - <7, (10, 12), 6>
        - <7, (13, 2), 14>
        - <12, (10, 7), 13>
        - <2, (8, 10), 12>
        - <2, (8, 6), 12>
        - <2, (13, 7), 1>
        - <8, (10, 12), 2>
        - <8, (10, 4), 13>
        - <5, (2, 14), 6>
        - <13, (7, 9), 11>
        - <13, (11, 9), 10>
        - <11, (9, 8), 2>
        - <11, (13, 4), 3>
        - <11, (14, 6), 2>
        - <14, (6, 12), 10>
        - <1, (7, 9), 11>
        - <1, (5, 2), 13>
        - <0, (9, 11), 13>
        - <3, (6, 12), 10>
        - <3, (5, 2), 8>
        - <3, (0, 9), 10>
        - <10, (7, 13), 4>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 30 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [30].
