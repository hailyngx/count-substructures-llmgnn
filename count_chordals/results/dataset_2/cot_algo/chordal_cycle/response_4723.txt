Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 29) (17, 25) (17, 18) (7, 10) (7, 27) (7, 13) (21, 28) (21, 29) (20, 25) (20, 9) (20, 24) (20, 11) (25, 17) (25, 20) (25, 16) (25, 15) (8, 14) (8, 23) (8, 19) (8, 16) (8, 22) (23, 8) (23, 26) (23, 5) (15, 25) (6, 0) (28, 21) (28, 1) (1, 28) (1, 26) (1, 16) (26, 23) (26, 1) (26, 11) (26, 4) (9, 20) (9, 22) (22, 8) (22, 9) (22, 2) (22, 3) (24, 20) (24, 3) (24, 27) (4, 26) (4, 27) (27, 7) (27, 24) (27, 4) (27, 2) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 29) (19, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (16, 25) (16, 8) (16, 1) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 5) (18, 17) (18, 5) (29, 14) (29, 21) (29, 19) (5, 23) (5, 2) (5, 18) (5, 0) (5, 3) (11, 20) (11, 26) (11, 19) (11, 12) (3, 14) (3, 22) (3, 24) (3, 5) (10, 7) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 0) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<0, 6, 0>
<0, 13, 7, 10, 7, 13>
<0, 13, 19, 29, 14, 8, 23, 26, 4, 27, 24, 20, 25, 17, 18, 5>
<1, 26, 23, 5, 18, 17, 25, 15>
<3, 5, 2, 22, 9, 20, 25, 17>
<4, 26, 23, 8, 19, 29, 21, 28, 1, 16>
<7, 13, 19, 29, 21, 28, 1>
<8, 14, 29, 19, 13, 0, 6>
<11, 12, 0, 6, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <0, 13, 19, 29, 14, 8, 23, 26, 4, 27, 24, 20, 25, 17, 18, 5> contains one chord (8, 25).
- <1, 26, 23, 5, 18, 17, 25, 15> contains one chord (1, 15).
- <4, 26, 23, 8, 19, 29, 21, 28, 1, 16> contains one chord (8, 16).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
