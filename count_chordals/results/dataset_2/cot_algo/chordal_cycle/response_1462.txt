Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 26) (5, 22) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (2, 14) (2, 21) (29, 28) (29, 7) (29, 10) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 24) (8, 16) (13, 8) (13, 28) (22, 5) (22, 23) (22, 11) (23, 22) (23, 25) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 27) (10, 17) (10, 29) (10, 15) (10, 1) (12, 27) (12, 28) (12, 15) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 0) (7, 29) (7, 0) (7, 16) (0, 23) (0, 27) (0, 7) (28, 29) (28, 13) (28, 12) (4, 24) (4, 20) (4, 11) (3, 17) (21, 2) (21, 6) (21, 24) (15, 10) (15, 12) (15, 26) (15, 11) (19, 8) (19, 25) (19, 1) (19, 6) (26, 5) (26, 15) (26, 25) (16, 8) (16, 23) (16, 7) (16, 25) (6, 14) (6, 21) (6, 19) (1, 10) (1, 19) (1, 18) (24, 8) (24, 4) (24, 21) (24, 20) (20, 4) (20, 24) (11, 22) (11, 4) (11, 15) (11, 18) (25, 23) (25, 19) (25, 26) (25, 16) (18, 1) (18, 11)

- Cycle 25: (4, 11, 22, 5)
- Cycle 26: (3, 17, 14, 6)
- Cycle 27: (21, 2, 14, 17)
- Cycle 28: (21, 24, 8, 13)
- Cycle 29: (15, 26, 5, 22)
- Cycle 30: (15, 12, 27, 0)

- Cycle 37: (18, 1, 10, 29)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <Cycle 7, (6, 21)>
- <Cycle 8, (17, 3)>
- <Cycle 9, (28, 13)>
- <Cycle 10, (28, 12)>
- <Cycle 11, (28, 12)>
- <Cycle 13, (27, 12)>
- <Cycle 14, (22, 11)>
- <Cycle 16, (17, 3)>
- <Cycle 17, (29, 13)>
- <Cycle 18, (27, 12)>
- <Cycle 19, (26, 15)>
- <Cycle 21, (23, 5)>
- <Cycle 22, (7, 28)>
- <Cycle 24, (24, 21)>
- <Cycle 25, (11, 22)>
- <Cycle 33, (14, 3)>
- <Cycle 34, (28, 29)>
- <Cycle 35, (23, 27)>
- <Cycle 36, (19, 13)>
- <Cycle 37, (10, 29)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 19 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [19].
