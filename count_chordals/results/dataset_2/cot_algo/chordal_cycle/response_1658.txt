This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 13) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 4) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 12) (4, 11) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 9-5-9-6-9
- Cycle 2: 9-6-7-9-5-9
- Cycle 3: 9-10-8-9-5-9
- Cycle 4: 9-10-11-9-5-9
- Cycle 5: 9-1-0-9-5-9
- Cycle 6: 9-1-7-9-5-9
- Cycle 7: 9-12-3-9-5-9
- Cycle 8: 6-14-0-6-7-6
- Cycle 9: 6-14-4-6-7-6
- Cycle 10: 6-7-2-6-8-6
- Cycle 11: 6-7-3-6-8-6
- Cycle 12: 6-8-10-6-9-6
- Cycle 13: 6-8-12-6-9-6
- Cycle 14: 6-13-11-6-15-6
- Cycle 15: 8-13-11-8-10-8
- Cycle 16: 8-13-3-8-12-8
- Cycle 17: 13-11-0-13-14-13
- Cycle 18: 10-8-12-10-11-10
- Cycle 19: 10-11-0-10-9-10
- Cycle 20: 11-13-3-11-12-11
- Cycle 21: 11-0-1-11-9-11
- Cycle 22: 0-14-3-0-1-0
- Cycle 23: 0-1-9-0-11-0
- Cycle 24: 14-6-8-14-13-14
- Cycle 25: 14-6-9-14-7-14
- Cycle 26: 14-7-1-14-0-14
- Cycle 27: 14-3-12-14-0-14

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 4: 9-10-11-9-5-9, Chord: (10, 11)
- Cycle 6: 9-1-7-9-5-9, Chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 13: 6-8-12-6-9-6, Chord: (8, 12)
- Cycle 14: 6-13-11-6-15-6, Chord: (13, 11)
- Cycle 15: 8-13-11-8-10-8, Chord: (13, 11)
- Cycle 17: 13-11-0-13-14-13, Chord: (11, 0)
- Cycle 19: 10-11-0-10-9-10, Chord: (11, 0)
- Cycle 22: 0-14-3-0-1-0, Chord: (14, 3)
- Cycle 24: 14-6-8-14-13-14, Chord: (6, 8)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [18].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <9, (10, 11), 5>
- <9, (1, 7), 5>
- <6, (8, 12), 9>
- <6, (13, 11), 15>
- <8, (13, 11), 10>
- <13, (11, 0), 14>
- <10, (11, 0), 9>
- <0, (14, 3), 1>
- <14, (6, 8), 13>
