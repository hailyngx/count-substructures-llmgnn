Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 3) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 10) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 7, 0, 9)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 2, 1, 9)
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 3, 2, 4)
- Cycle 4: (5, 8, 3, 10, 11, 9)
- Cycle 5: (5, 3, 2, 1, 9)
- Cycle 6: (5, 9, 11, 13, 4)
- Cycle 7: (5, 9, 11, 10, 3, 8)
- Cycle 8: (5, 9, 1, 2, 4)
- Cycle 9: (5, 9, 1, 6, 4)
- Cycle 10: (5, 9, 1, 14, 0, 7)
- Cycle 11: (5, 9, 1, 6, 3, 10)
- Cycle 12: (5, 9, 1, 2, 3, 8)
- Cycle 13: (5, 3, 6, 13, 4)
- Cycle 14: (5, 3, 14, 0, 9)
- Cycle 15: (5, 8, 3, 6, 1, 9)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <5, 4, 7, 0, 9> has one chord: (4, 0)
- <5, 4, 2, 1, 9> has one chord: (4, 1)
- <5, 3, 6, 13, 4> has one chord: (3, 13)
- <5, 9, 1, 6, 4> has one chord: (1, 6)
- <5, 9, 1, 14, 0, 7> has one chord: (1, 7)
- <5, 9, 1, 6, 3, 10> has one chord: (1, 10)
- <5, 8, 3, 2, 4> has one chord: (3, 2)
- <5, 9, 11, 10, 3, 8> has one chord: (11, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
