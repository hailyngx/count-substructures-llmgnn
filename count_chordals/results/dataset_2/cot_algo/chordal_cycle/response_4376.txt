Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
{1, 3, 5, 6}
{0, 1, 6, 7}
{0, 1, 3, 4}
{0, 1, 3, 9}
{0, 2, 3, 9}
{0, 2, 6, 8}
{1, 3, 4, 9}
{5, 6, 7, 8}

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
{1, 3, 5, 6} - No chord
{0, 1, 6, 7} -  Chord: (1, 7)
{0, 1, 3, 4} - No chord
{0, 1, 3, 9} -  Chord: (1, 9)
{0, 2, 3, 9} -  Chord: (2, 9)
{0, 2, 6, 8} -  Chord: (2, 8)
{1, 3, 4, 9} -  Chord: (4, 9)
{5, 6, 7, 8} -  Chord: (6, 8)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 1, 3, 9>
<0, 2, 3, 9>
<0, 2, 6, 8>
<5, 6, 7, 8>
