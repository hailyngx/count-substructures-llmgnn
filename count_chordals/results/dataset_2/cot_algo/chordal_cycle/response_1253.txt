Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 1, 4, 5>
2. Cycle <0, 1, 3, 6>
3. Cycle <0, 2, 5, 7>
4. Cycle <0, 3, 6, 8>
5. Cycle <0, 4, 5, 7>
6. Cycle <1, 3, 6, 8>
7. Cycle <1, 4, 5, 7>
8. Cycle <2, 5, 7, 6>
9. Cycle <3, 6, 8, 0>
10. Cycle <4, 5, 7, 6>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges) are:
1. <0, 1, (4, 5), 3, 6>
2. <0, 3, (6, 8), 0, 1>
3. <0, 4, (5, 7), 6, 3>
4. <1, 3, (6, 8), 0, 1>
5. <1, 4, (5, 7), 6, 3>
6. <2, 5, (7, 6), 3, 1>
7. <3, 6, (8, 0), 4, 5>
8. <4, 5, (7, 6), 3, 1>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [2].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are <0, 1, (4, 5), 3, 6> and <3, 6, (8, 0), 4, 5>.
