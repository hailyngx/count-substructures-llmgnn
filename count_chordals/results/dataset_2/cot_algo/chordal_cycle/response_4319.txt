Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 22) (14, 24) (14, 13) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 12) (17, 15) (8, 22) (8, 27) (13, 14) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 10) (12, 17) (12, 27) (12, 11) (12, 15) (27, 8) (27, 12) (27, 4) (27, 24) (27, 23) (23, 27) (23, 3) (23, 0) (15, 17) (15, 12) (15, 20) (15, 6) (15, 4) (20, 15) (20, 29) (20, 7) (20, 28) (0, 23) (0, 21) (21, 0) (21, 28) (21, 26) (21, 18) (21, 25) (28, 20) (28, 21) (28, 25) (11, 12) (4, 27) (4, 15) (4, 29) (7, 20) (25, 21) (25, 28) (25, 26) (25, 19) (29, 20) (29, 4) (29, 9) (29, 16) (9, 29) (9, 18) (9, 2) (5, 22) (26, 21) (26, 25) (6, 15) (6, 24) (6, 1) (6, 19) (24, 14) (24, 27) (24, 6) (24, 16) (2, 9) (1, 6) (1, 18) (18, 21) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 16) (3, 17) (3, 23) (16, 13) (16, 29) (16, 24) (16, 18) (22, 14) (22, 8) (22, 5) (19, 25) (19, 6) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle with 4 edges: (14, 13, 17, 15, 14)
- Cycle with 4 edges: (27, 12, 11, 12, 27)
- Cycle with 4 edges: (27, 12, 15, 6, 24, 27)
- Cycle with 4 edges: (27, 4, 29, 20, 15, 12, 27)
- Cycle with 4 edges: (21, 0, 23, 3, 17, 12, 27, 23, 21)
- Cycle with 4 edges: (21, 0, 23, 27, 12, 15, 20, 29, 4, 24, 6, 21)
- Cycle with 5 edges: (15, 17, 12, 27, 23, 15)
- Cycle with 6 edges: (13, 17, 12, 27, 4, 29, 13)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle (14, 13, 17, 15, 14) has the chord (15, 17)
- Cycle (27, 12, 11, 12, 27) has the chord (11, 12)
- Cycle (27, 12, 15, 6, 24, 27) has the chord (15, 24)
- Cycle (27, 4, 29, 20, 15, 12, 27) has the chord (29, 12)
- Cycle (21, 0, 23, 3, 17, 12, 27, 23, 21) has the chord (3, 12)
- Cycle (21, 0, 23, 27, 12, 15, 20, 29, 4, 24, 6, 21) has the chord (15, 29)
- Cycle (15, 17, 12, 27, 23, 15) has the chord (17, 23)
- Cycle (13, 17, 12, 27, 4, 29, 13) has the chord (4, 13)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
