Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal Cycle 1: <1, (2, 8), 10, (11, 13), 1>
- Chordal Cycle 2: <1, (10, 17), 3, (11, 13), 1>
- Chordal Cycle 3: <1, (5, 13), 11, (6, 10), 1>
- Chordal Cycle 4: <3, (10, 17), 11, (13, 6), 3>
- Chordal Cycle 5: <3, (10, 2), 8, (16, 14), 3>
- Chordal Cycle 6: <10, (17, 11), 13, (6, 10)>
- Chordal Cycle 7: <10, (2, 8), 16, (14, 19), 10>
- Chordal Cycle 8: <10, (2, 11), 13, (6, 10)>
- Chordal Cycle 9: <17, (11, 13), 10, (6, 19), 17>
- Chordal Cycle 10: <2, (8, 16), 14, (19, 2), 2>
- Chordal Cycle 11: <5, (13, 11), 6, (19, 5), 5>
- Chordal Cycle 12: <13, (11, 17), 10, (2, 13), 13>
- Chordal Cycle 13: <0, (15, 4), 12, (14, 10), 0>
- Chordal Cycle 14: <15, (4, 12), 14, (19, 15), 15>
- Chordal Cycle 15: <11, (13, 6), 19, (14, 11), 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- Number of chordless cycles: [18]
