Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 9) (16, 19) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 28) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 20) (9, 19) (9, 12) (7, 11) (7, 3) (21, 5) (21, 27) (21, 26) (8, 13) (8, 25) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 8) (23, 0) (4, 24) (4, 10) (4, 2) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 17) (20, 9) (20, 18) (17, 15) (17, 3) (17, 2) (0, 23) (0, 3) (0, 25) (0, 6) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 22) (2, 12) (22, 2) (22, 24) (22, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 28) (14, 11) (14, 28) (14, 24) (10, 4) (10, 26) (26, 21) (26, 10) (26, 25) (19, 16) (19, 9) (19, 15) (19, 24) (19, 1) (6, 0) (6, 25) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 0) (1, 22) (1, 19) (1, 18) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 26) (25, 6) (27, 21) (18, 15) (18, 20) (18, 1) (24, 4) (24, 22) (24, 14) (24, 19) (28, 5) (28, 12) (28, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 16, 19, 15, 17, 2, 12, 28, 14)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 16, 19, 24, 14, 28, 12, 2, 17)
- Cycle 3: (5, 12, 2, 17, 3, 0, 23, 6, 25, 8)
- Cycle 4: (5, 12, 2, 17, 15, 18, 1, 22, 24, 14)
- Cycle 5: (7, 3, 17, 15, 19, 24, 14, 28, 12, 2)
- Cycle 6: (11, 14, 24, 22, 1, 18, 20, 9, 5, 13)
- Cycle 7: (11, 2, 17, 15, 18, 1, 22, 24, 14, 28)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 14)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (9, 24)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (23, 8)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (12, 14)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (15, 28)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (12, 22)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (15, 28)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 0 chordless 4-cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
