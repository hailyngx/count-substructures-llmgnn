Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 25) (9, 24) (9, 1) (9, 12) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 15) (26, 7) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 23) (13, 27) (2, 16) (2, 3) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 28) (4, 5) (4, 29) (17, 16) (17, 28) (17, 27) (29, 4) (29, 19) (1, 9) (1, 22) (1, 27) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 10) (21, 14) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (5, 11) (19, 18) (19, 29) (19, 5) (19, 22) (14, 26) (14, 21) (22, 1) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 28) (22, 7) (10, 26) (10, 3) (10, 27) (10, 23) (11, 8) (11, 18) (11, 5) (11, 24) (24, 9) (24, 3) (24, 11) (0, 3) (0, 15) (25, 9) (25, 16) (25, 12) (15, 26) (15, 0) (28, 18) (28, 17) (28, 22) (16, 2) (16, 17) (16, 25) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 25) (12, 20) (20, 12) (6, 22) (6, 23) (6, 27) (27, 13) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 10) (27, 6) (7, 26) (7, 22) (23, 13) (23, 10) (23, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (9, 25, 16, 2, 3, 24, 9)
        - Cycle 2: (10, 26, 21, 14, 26, 10)
        - Cycle 3: (13, 8, 11, 5, 4, 29, 19, 18, 13)
        - Cycle 4: (1, 9, 25, 12, 5, 4, 29, 1)
        - Cycle 5: (22, 1, 27, 6, 22)
        - Cycle 6: (27, 6, 23, 10, 26, 7, 22, 27)
        - Cycle 7: (3, 2, 16, 25, 12, 20, 12, 5, 11, 24, 3)
        - Cycle 8: (24, 3, 10, 27, 17, 28, 22, 7, 26, 15, 0, 3)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Cycle 1: (9, 25, 16, 2, 3, 24, 9) has one chord (9, 24)
        - Cycle 7: (3, 2, 16, 25, 12, 20, 12, 5, 11, 24, 3) has one chord (16, 25)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There are 0 chordless 4-cycles found in this graph, so the final count is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
        - <9, (9, 24), 25, 16, 2>
        - <3, (16, 25), 12, 20>
