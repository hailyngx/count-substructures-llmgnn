Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Among the cycles listed above, the cycle <18, 8, 6, 9> has exactly one chord which is the edge (8, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1]. The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <18, 8, 6, 9>.
