Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges are:
- Cycle 1: 5-8-6-7-5
- Cycle 2: 9-4-1-6-9
- Cycle 3: 4-3-1-6-4
- Cycle 4: 7-6-1-4-7
- Cycle 5: 3-2-6-4-3

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, only Cycle 2: <9, 1> has exactly one chord {1, 9}, so this is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <9, (1, 9), 4)>, and the total number of chordless cycles is [0].
