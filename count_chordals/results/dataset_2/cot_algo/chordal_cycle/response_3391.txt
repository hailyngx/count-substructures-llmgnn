Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
  
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (0, 11), 4, 13, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (14, 4), 8, 13, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (7, 8), 9, 6, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (14, 9), 6, 13, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <7, (9, 14), 5, 6, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <10, (13, 1), 4, 10, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <12, (6, 8), 9, 14, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <11, (4, 6), 13, 8, 11>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
  
- There are 52 chordless cycles.
  
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
