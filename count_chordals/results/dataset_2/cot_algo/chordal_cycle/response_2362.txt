Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (9, 18) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 23) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 24) (21, 7) (21, 19) (21, 29) (18, 9) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (10, 28) (10, 29) (11, 7) (11, 23) (23, 4) (23, 11) (23, 14) (23, 1) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 17) (20, 0) (20, 15) (20, 13) (20, 6) (15, 20) (15, 24) (6, 7) (6, 20) (6, 28) (28, 10) (28, 6) (26, 14) (26, 27) (1, 23) (1, 25) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (13, 5) (13, 20) (13, 2) (29, 21) (29, 10) (29, 12) (25, 1) (25, 19) (27, 26) (27, 16) (19, 21) (19, 18) (19, 10) (19, 25) (19, 24) (14, 23) (14, 26) (14, 1) (12, 29) (12, 16) (12, 17) (16, 27) (16, 12) (8, 3) (8, 17) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 24) (24, 7) (24, 15) (24, 19) (24, 2) (17, 18) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (7, 4, 23, 1, 14)
- Cycle 2: (7, 4, 23, 11, 7)
- Cycle 3: (7, 4, 3, 2, 10)
- Cycle 4: (7, 4, 3, 8, 17)
- Cycle 5: (7, 4, 23, 1, 25)
- Cycle 6: (7, 4, 3, 2, 13)
- Cycle 7: (7, 4, 23, 11, 23)
- Cycle 8: (7, 4, 23, 1, 14)
- Cycle 9: (7, 4, 23, 11, 23)
- Cycle 10: (7, 4, 3, 8, 17)
- Cycle 11: (7, 4, 23, 11, 23)

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (7, 14), 23, 4, 11>
- <2, (4, 23), 3, 10, 7>
- <2, (4, 23), 3, 13, 7>
- <2, (3, 8), 4, 17, 7>
- <1, (4, 23), 11, 23, 7>
- <1, (4, 23), 14, 1, 7>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0].
