Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  

- Cycle 1: (5, 7, 1, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 5, 2, 8, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  

- Cycle 1 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (9, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  

As there is only one chordless cycle, the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:  
<1, (9, 2), 5>
