Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 16) (6, 17) (6, 12) (6, 19) (6, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 17) (8, 9) (8, 13) (13, 6) (13, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 14) (16, 15) (16, 14) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 5) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 19) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 19) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 2) (14, 18) (14, 16) (19, 6) (19, 12) (19, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 3 - 1 - 15 - 16 - 3
- Cycle 2: 3 - 4 - 9 - 10 - 3
- Cycle 3: 3 - 4 - 11 - 17 - 6 - 13 - 8 - 9 - 4 - 3
- Cycle 4: 3 - 4 - 7 - 10 - 9 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 5: 3 - 4 - 18 - 14 - 16 - 15 - 1 - 3
- Cycle 6: 3 - 0 - 9 - 8 - 13 - 6 - 17 - 11 - 5 - 2 - 12 - 19 - 3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has a chord <6, 2>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found, which is <6, 2, 3, 4>.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
