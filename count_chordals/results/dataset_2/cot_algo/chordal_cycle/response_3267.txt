Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

(5, 9, 2, 6, 7)
(5, 9, 7, 3, 8)
(5, 9, 3, 7, 0)
(5, 9, 7, 6, 0)
(5, 4, 8, 0, 6)
(5, 4, 8, 3, 7)
(5, 4, 8, 0, 1)
(5, 4, 8, 3, 9)
(5, 4, 8, 0, 7)
(5, 4, 8, 3, 5)
(5, 8, 0, 6, 7)
(5, 8, 0, 1, 4)
(5, 8, 0, 1, 0)
(5, 8, 0, 6, 2)
(5, 8, 4, 0, 1)
(5, 8, 4, 0, 6)
(5, 8, 4, 0, 7)
(5, 8, 4, 0, 3)
(5, 8, 3, 7, 0)
(5, 8, 3, 7, 6)
(5, 8, 3, 7, 9)
(5, 8, 3, 7, 3)
(5, 1, 0, 7, 6)
(5, 1, 0, 6, 2)
(5, 1, 8, 0, 6)
(5, 1, 8, 4, 0)
(5, 1, 8, 4, 3)
(5, 1, 8, 0, 7)
(5, 1, 8, 3, 7)
...

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycle found:
[1]

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
[0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<5, 8, 0, 6>
