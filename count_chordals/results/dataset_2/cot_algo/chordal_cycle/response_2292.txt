Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 2) (15, 9) (15, 28) (15, 11) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 23) (27, 22) (27, 7) (27, 16) (27, 5) (8, 0) (8, 11) (13, 18) (7, 27) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 28) (12, 0) (12, 7) (12, 23) (28, 15) (28, 7) (28, 6) (28, 14) (29, 16) (29, 21) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (26, 1) (26, 19) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 22) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 20) (9, 10) (22, 27) (22, 6) (19, 26) (19, 5) (19, 24) (5, 27) (5, 19) (11, 15) (11, 8) (11, 23) (11, 18) (11, 20) (23, 0) (23, 12) (23, 11) (10, 9) (10, 21) (10, 4) (10, 24) (21, 29) (21, 10) (21, 16) (21, 14) (16, 27) (16, 29) (16, 21) (14, 28) (14, 1) (14, 21) (2, 3) (2, 20) (2, 17) (2, 25) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 11) (24, 7) (24, 19) (24, 10) (24, 20) (25, 2) (4, 10) (4, 20) (17, 2) (20, 9) (20, 11) (20, 2) (20, 24) (20, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more that can be found in the graph are:

(0, 8, 11, 15) 
(0, 11, 15, 18) 
(0, 11, 23, 12) 
(0, 12, 7, 24) 
(0, 12, 23, 11) 
(0, 15, 9, 1) 
(1, 6, 28, 14) 
(1, 9, 15, 28) 
(1, 9, 10, 21) 
(1, 14, 28, 6) 
(1, 26, 19, 5) 
(2, 3, 27, 22) 
(2, 3, 15, 9) 
(2, 11, 20, 9) 
(2, 17, 20, 4) 
(2, 20, 4, 10) 
(2, 20, 24, 7) 
(2, 20, 24, 19) 
(2, 25, 26, 1) 
(3, 2, 11, 8) 
(4, 10, 21, 29) 
(4, 10, 24, 7) 
(4, 10, 24, 19) 
(4, 20, 11, 15) 
(5, 19, 24, 7) 
(5, 19, 26, 1) 
(6, 1, 9, 15) 
(6, 1, 14, 28) 
(6, 22, 27, 5) 
(6, 28, 15, 9) 

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:

<0, (8, 11), 15, (18, 0)>
<0, (11, 15), 18, (0, 12)>
<0, (12, 7), 24, (12, 23)>
<0, (15, 9), 1, (0, 8)>
<1, (6, 28), 14, (1, 9)>
<1, (9, 15), 28, (1, 14)>
<1, (9, 10), 21, (1, 15)>
<2, (3, 27), 22, (2, 25)>
<2, (11, 20), 9, (2, 15)>
<2, (17, 20), 4, (2, 10)>
<2, (20, 4), 10, (2, 17)>
<2, (20, 24), 7, (2, 3)>
<3, (2, 11), 8, (3, 27)>
<4, (10, 21), 29, (4, 20)>
<4, (10, 24), 7, (4, 19)>
<5, (19, 24), 7, (5, 27)>
<5, (19, 26), 1, (5, 27)>
<6, (1, 9), 15, (6, 28)>
<6, (1, 14), 28, (6, 9)>
<6, (22, 27), 5, (6, 28)> 

Step 3:
There are 18 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [18].
