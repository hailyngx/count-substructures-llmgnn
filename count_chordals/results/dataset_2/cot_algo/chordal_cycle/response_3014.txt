Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 5) (10, 17) (10, 15) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 13) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 12) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (18, 15) (18, 12) (8, 7) (8, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (5, 7) (5, 17) (19, 6) (19, 3) (15, 4) (15, 10) (15, 18) (15, 16) (13, 11) (13, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 16) (0, 1) (16, 14) (16, 15) (16, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 5, 17) with edges (4, 7), (7, 5), (5, 17), (17, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 2, 1, 7) with edges (4, 2), (2, 1), (1, 7), (7, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 15, 10, 17) with edges (4, 15), (15, 10), (10, 17), (17, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 15, 16, 14) with edges (4, 15), (15, 16), (16, 14), (14, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 11, 14, 17) with edges (4, 11), (11, 14), (14, 17), (17, 4)
- Cycle 6: (7, 1, 0, 3) with edges (7, 1), (1, 0), (0, 3), (3, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 1, 2, 13) with edges (7, 1), (1, 2), (2, 13), (13, 7)
- Cycle 8: (7, 1, 0, 4) with edges (7, 1), (1, 0), (0, 4), (4, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <4, (7, 5), 17>
- <4, 2, (1, 7)>
- <4, (15, 10), 17>
- <4, (15, 16), 14>
- <4, (11, 14), 17>
- <7, 1, (0, 3)>
- <7, 1, (2, 13)>
- <7, 1, (0, 4)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = [8].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<4, (7, 5), 17>
<4, 2, (1, 7)>
<4, (15, 10), 17>
<4, (15, 16), 14>
<4, (11, 14), 17>
<7, 1, (0, 3)>
<7, 1, (2, 13)>
<7, 1, (0, 4)>
