Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-7-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-2-5-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-7-9-1
- Cycle 4: 1-4-3-8-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-5-2-1

Step 2:
Only Cycle 2: 1-4-2-5-1 has exactly one chord (4, 5) <(4, 5)>.

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, 4, 2, 5>
