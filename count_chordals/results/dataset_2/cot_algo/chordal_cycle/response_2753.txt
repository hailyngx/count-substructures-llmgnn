Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 6) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 11) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 12) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 14) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
    - <1, 3, 13, 9>
    - <1, 3, 7, 9>
    - <1, 13, 3, 12>
    - <1, 13, 9, 6>
    - <3, 1, 13, 12>
    - <3, 1, 9, 6>
    - <3, 13, 12, 14>
    - <4, 8, 6, 9>
    - <6, 4, 8, 10>
    - <9, 7, 3, 1>
    - <9, 13, 3, 12>
    - <11, 6, 9, 2>
    - <12, 3, 13, 9>
    - <12, 13, 9, 6>
    - <13, 1, 3, 12>

Step 2:
After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, the chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <1, 3, 13, 9> with a chord (1, 13)

Step 3:
There is [1] chordless 4-cycle found in the graph.
