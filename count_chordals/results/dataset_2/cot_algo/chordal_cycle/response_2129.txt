Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 11) (14, 17) (14, 10) (17, 14) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 15) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 18) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 3) (0, 19) (2, 7) (2, 19) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 6) (15, 10) (15, 8) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 19) (16, 13) (16, 7) (16, 19) (19, 4) (19, 0) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 16) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 18) (18, 7) (18, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 11 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 2: 14 - 17 - 10 - 15 - 14
- Cycle 3: 14 - 10 - 11 - 9 - 14
- Cycle 4: 14 - 10 - 12 - 7 - 14
- Cycle 5: 10 - 15 - 8 - 5 - 10
- Cycle 6: 3 - 13 - 16 - 19 - 3
- Cycle 7: 3 - 13 - 5 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 8: 3 - 2 - 7 - 18 - 3
- Cycle 9: 3 - 2 - 19 - 6 - 3
- Cycle 10: 4 - 12 - 7 - 18 - 4
- Cycle 11: 4 - 12 - 10 - 1 - 4

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (9, 6) - <1, (9, 6), 2>
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (17, 15) - <2, (17, 15), 10>
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (11, 9) - <3, (11, 9), 7>
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (10, 12) - <4, (10, 12), 7>
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (15, 5) - <5, (15, 5), 8>
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (13, 16) - <6, (13, 16), 19>
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (13, 8) - <7, (13, 8), 5>
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (7, 18) - <8, (7, 18), 2>
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (2, 19) - <9, (2, 19), 6>
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (12, 7) - <10, (12, 7), 18>
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: (12, 1) - <11, (12, 1), 10>

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles found: [0]
