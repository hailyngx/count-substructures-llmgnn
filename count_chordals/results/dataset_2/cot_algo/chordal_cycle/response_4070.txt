Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 8) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 6) (4, 9) (4, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 1-3-6-0-1
- Cycle 2: 1-11-2-0-1
- Cycle 3: 1-14-9-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-8-7-11-1
- Cycle 5: 2-3-6-0-2
- Cycle 6: 2-11-7-8-2
- Cycle 7: 3-1-14-9-3
- Cycle 8: 3-2-11-7-3
- Cycle 9: 6-3-12-8-6
- Cycle 10: 6-0-12-8-6
- Cycle 11: 7-8-12-0-7
- Cycle 12: 11-2-12-0-11
- Cycle 13: 11-7-10-0-11
- Cycle 14: 14-9-5-13-14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Only Cycle 5: 2-3-6-0-2 has exactly one chord: (3, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The total number of chordal 4-cycles is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <2, (3, 6), 0>
