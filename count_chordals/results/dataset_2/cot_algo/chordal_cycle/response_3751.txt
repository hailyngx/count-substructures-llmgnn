Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1-3-4-5-1
2. Cycle 1-3-6-5-1
3. Cycle 1-3-4-8-1
4. Cycle 1-6-9-8-1
5. Cycle 1-6-9-0-1
6. Cycle 1-3-0-9-1
7. Cycle 1-2-7-2-1
8. Cycle 3-4-8-9-3
9. Cycle 3-4-8-9-6
10. Cycle 3-4-8-9-0
11. Cycle 3-6-9-0-3
12. Cycle 3-6-9-0-1
13. Cycle 3-6-9-8-4
14. Cycle 3-6-5-2-1
15. Cycle 3-6-5-2-7
16. Cycle 3-1-2-5-3
17. Cycle 3-6-1-5-3
18. Cycle 3-1-5-6-3
19. Cycle 4-8-9-6-4
20. Cycle 4-8-3-6-4
21. Cycle 8-9-6-3-8
22. Cycle 8-9-0-3-8
23. Cycle 8-9-0-1-8
24. Cycle 8-3-6-9-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

1. <1, 3, 4, 5> has a chord (3, 5)
2. <1, 3, 6, 5> has a chord (3, 5)
3. <1, 3, 4, 8> has a chord (4, 8)
4. <1, 6, 9, 8> has a chord (9, 8)
5. <1, 6, 9, 0> has a chord (9, 0)
6. <1, 3, 0, 9> has a chord (3, 9)
7. <1, 2, 7, 2> has a chord (7, 2)
8. <3, 4, 8, 9> has a chord (4, 9)
9. <3, 6, 9, 0> has a chord (6, 9)
10. <3, 6, 9, 8> has a chord (6, 8)
11. <3, 1, 5, 6> has a chord (1, 5)
12. <4, 8, 9, 6> has a chord (8, 6)
13. <8, 9, 6, 3> has a chord (9, 3)
14. <8, 9, 0, 3> has a chord (9, 3)
15. <8, 9, 0, 1> has a chord (9, 1)
16. <3, 6, 9, 8> has a chord (6, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [16].
