Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 3) (1, 15) (1, 0) (1, 7) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 15) (10, 12) (13, 17) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 7) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 8) (17, 4) (8, 17) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 2) (7, 1) (7, 13) (7, 16) (7, 5) (16, 17) (16, 7) (2, 19) (2, 12) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) (18, 19) (18, 12) (18, 14) (11, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (14, 6) (14, 15) (14, 18) (4, 17) (4, 0) (0, 1) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 4) (5, 7)

- <12, 8, 17, 16>
- <12, 8, 17, 13>
- <12, 8, 3, 9>
- <12, 0, 4, 17>

- <3, 9, 6, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <6, 9, (3, 8), 12>
- <6, 10, (15, 1), 7>
- <6, 14, (15, 10), 18>
- <6, 17, (13, 11), 7>
- <6, 17, (4, 0), 13>
- <9, 6, (10, 15), 1>
- <9, 3, (8, 12), 17>
- <1, 15, (0, 4), 12>
- <15, 10, (6, 9), 13>
- <17, 13, (11, 7), 16>
- <13, 17, (4, 0), 8>
- <8, 12, (10, 6), 17>
- <19, 13, (7, 1), 17>
- <7, 13, (17, 6), 16>
- <12, 8, (17, 16), 3>
- <18, 12, (19, 2), 8>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
