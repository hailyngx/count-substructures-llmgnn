Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 5) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 16) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 8) (17, 14) (17, 0) (17, 5) (17, 2) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 10) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 10) (7, 0) (7, 9) (5, 3) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 11) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 6) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (11, 19) (11, 13) (1, 13) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 1) (6, 8) (6, 16) (6, 10) (6, 18) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 16) (9, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 9-7-0-17-9
- Cycle 2: 9-7-0-10-9
- Cycle 3: 9-7-0-17-14-8-6-9
- Cycle 4: 9-7-0-17-14-8-6-18-19-11-13-1-9
- Cycle 5: 9-7-0-17-2-4-13-11-19-18-6-8-14-17-9
- Cycle 6: 3-9-16-15-19-18-6-8-14-17-2-4-13-11-1-13-4-2-17-5-3
- Cycle 7: 5-3-9-7-0-10-6-18-19-15-16-9-12-5
- Cycle 8: 5-3-9-7-0-10-6-8-14-17-2-4-13-11-19-15-16-9-12-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <9, (0, 17), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <9, (0, 10), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <9, (0, 17), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (0, 17), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, (0, 17), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <3, (9, 15), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, (9, 16), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, (9, 16), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are [0] chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
