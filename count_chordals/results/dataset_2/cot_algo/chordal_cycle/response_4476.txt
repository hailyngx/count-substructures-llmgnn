Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 7, 1, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 1, 6, 8, 0, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 1, 3, 2, 6, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 2, 7, 4, 6, 2, 5)
- Cycle 8: (9, 7, 2, 0, 8, 6, 4, 3, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 7, 1, 6, 2, 3, 4, 0, 8, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 7, 1, 5) <(9, 1)>
- Cycle 5: (5, 1, 6, 8, 0, 5) <(1, 8)>
- Cycle 6: (5, 1, 3, 2, 6, 5) <(1, 2)>
- Cycle 7: (5, 2, 7, 4, 6, 2, 5) <(2, 4)>
- Cycle 8: (9, 7, 2, 0, 8, 6, 4, 3, 9) has more than one chord
- Cycle 9: (9, 7, 1, 6, 2, 3, 4, 0, 8, 9) <(9, 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph: <5, 1, 6, 8, 0>, <5, 1, 3, 2, 6>, <5, 2, 7, 4, 6>, <9, 7, 1, 6, 2, 3, 4, 0, 8, 9>.
Therefore, the final number is [4].
