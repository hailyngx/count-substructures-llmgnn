Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-3-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-4-5-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-4-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-3-2-7-0
- Cycle 5: 0-7-9-5-0
- Cycle 6: 0-7-4-5-0
- Cycle 7: 0-8-6-5-0
- Cycle 8: 0-8-4-7-0
- Cycle 9: 1-3-4-5-1
- Cycle 10: 2-3-4-7-2
- Cycle 11: 2-4-7-0-2
- Cycle 12: 2-4-8-0-2
- Cycle 13: 5-4-7-9-5
- Cycle 14: 6-8-4-5-6

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find that the following cycles have exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <cycle 4, (0, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <cycle 5, (7, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <cycle 9, (1, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <cycle 10, (3, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <cycle 11, (4, 0)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <cycle 14, (5, 6)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have [6].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 3, 4, 2> with chord (0, 2)
- <0, 7, 9, 5> with chord (7, 9)
- <1, 3, 4, 5> with chord (1, 5)
- <2, 3, 4, 7> with chord (3, 7)
- <2, 4, 7, 0> with chord (4, 0)
- <5, 4, 7, 9> with chord (5, 6)
