Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (11, 5, 13, 16, 22)
        - Cycle 2: (11, 17, 18, 13, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (16, 22, 15, 13, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (16, 13, 18, 17, 11)
        - Cycle 5: (16, 2, 8, 19, 1)
        - Cycle 6: (16, 2, 8, 20, 21)
        - Cycle 7: (16, 2, 8, 27, 25)
        - Cycle 8: (3, 25, 27, 8, 2)
        - Cycle 9: (3, 25, 12, 0, 3)
        - Cycle 10: (25, 3, 0, 12, 25)
        - Cycle 11: (25, 27, 8, 19, 1)
        - Cycle 12: (25, 27, 8, 20, 21)
        - Cycle 13: (2, 16, 22, 15, 13)
        - Cycle 14: (8, 2, 16, 13, 5)
        - Cycle 15: (8, 2, 16, 22, 9)
        - Cycle 16: (8, 27, 25, 3, 0)
        - Cycle 17: (8, 27, 25, 12, 10)
        - Cycle 18: (9, 22, 16, 13, 5)
        - Cycle 19: (22, 16, 2, 8, 27)
        - Cycle 20: (22, 16, 13, 5, 11)
        - Cycle 21: (5, 11, 17, 18, 13)
        - Cycle 22: (5, 13, 18, 17, 24)
        - Cycle 23: (13, 16, 2, 8, 19)
        - Cycle 24: (13, 16, 2, 8, 27)
        - Cycle 25: (13, 18, 17, 11, 26)
        - Cycle 26: (1, 19, 8, 2, 16)
        - Cycle 27: (17, 11, 5, 13, 18)
        - Cycle 28: (17, 18, 13, 15, 22)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, (19, 8), 5>
        - <2, (16, 2), 22>
        - <3, (8, 27), 25>
        - <4, (16, 13), 5>
        - <5, (17, 18), 13>
        - <6, (19, 8), 2>
        - <7, (19, 8), 27>
        - <8, (25, 12), 0>
        - <9, (25, 12), 10>
        - <10, (27, 8), 2>
        - <11, (27, 8), 19>
        - <12, (8, 2), 16>
        - <13, (8, 27), 25>
        - <14, (13, 5), 11>
        - <15, (13, 18), 17>
        - <16, (16, 2), 8>
        - <17, (16, 13), 5>
        - <18, (18, 13), 15>
        - <19, (5, 11), 17>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 19 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [19].
