Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 15) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 7) (12, 1) (5, 13) (5, 15) (5, 14) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 1) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 18) (16, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (17, 7) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 2) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 9) (19, 11) (19, 17) (14, 7) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 17) (2, 14) (15, 11) (15, 5) (15, 0) (15, 18) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 18) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 15) (18, 6) (9, 3) (9, 17) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph. Let's list them:
1. Cycle <0, 11, 1, 12, 7, 13, 5, 14, 3> 
2. Cycle <0, 11, 1, 13, 7, 17, 9, 3> 
3. Cycle <0, 11, 1, 13, 5, 14, 7, 17> 
4. Cycle <0, 11, 1, 13, 7, 12, 1, 11> 
5. Cycle <0, 11, 1, 9, 17, 7, 12, 1> 
6. Cycle <0, 11, 19, 17, 7, 12, 1, 13>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the cycles with exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes) are:
1. Cycle <0, 11, 1, 13, 7, 12, 1, 11>  (Chord: (1, 11))
2. Cycle <0, 11, 1, 9, 17, 7, 12, 1>  (Chord: (1, 9))

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [\[[2]\]].  
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <0, 11, 1, 13, 7, 12, 1, 11> (Chord: (1, 11))
2. <0, 11, 1, 9, 17, 7, 12, 1> (Chord: (1, 9))
