Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 3) (8, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 0-1-4-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-2-4-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-2-3-0
- Cycle 4: 0-2-3-4-0
- Cycle 5: 1-2-4-3-1
- Cycle 6: 2-4-3-0-2
- Cycle 7: 3-4-0-1-3
- Cycle 8: 3-4-2-1-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Among the cycles listed above, cycle 6: 2-4-3-0-2 has exactly one chord which is (4, 0).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

Number of chordal 4-cycles = [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (4, 0)>
