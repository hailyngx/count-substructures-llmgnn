Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 14) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (1, 8) (1, 14) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 3) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 4, 7, 5, 9)
- Cycle 3: (5, 13, 0, 10, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 13, 6, 14, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 0, 10, 3, 5)
- Cycle 6: (9, 11, 14, 6, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 11, 12, 2, 9)
- Cycle 8: (4, 7, 5, 13, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 7, 0, 10, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 12, 11, 14, 4)
- Cycle 11: (7, 5, 13, 6, 7)
- Cycle 12: (11, 9, 4, 7, 11)
- Cycle 13: (11, 9, 2, 3, 11)
- Cycle 14: (11, 12, 5, 13, 11)
- Cycle 15: (11, 12, 14, 1, 11)
- Cycle 16: (8, 9, 4, 7, 8)
- Cycle 17: (13, 5, 9, 11, 13)
- Cycle 18: (13, 5, 7, 4, 13)
- Cycle 19: (13, 0, 10, 3, 13)
- Cycle 20: (0, 10, 3, 9, 0)
- Cycle 21: (14, 11, 12, 5, 14)
- Cycle 22: (14, 11, 9, 4, 14)
- Cycle 23: (3, 9, 4, 7, 3)
- Cycle 24: (3, 9, 11, 14, 3)
- Cycle 25: (3, 10, 0, 13, 3)
- Cycle 26: (3, 10, 2, 6, 3)
- Cycle 27: (12, 5, 9, 11, 12)
- Cycle 28: (12, 5, 13, 0, 12)
- Cycle 29: (12, 11, 14, 6, 12)
- Cycle 30: (6, 8, 9, 4, 6)
- Cycle 31: (6, 14, 11, 9, 6)
- Cycle 32: (6, 2, 3, 10, 6)
- Cycle 33: (1, 8, 9, 11, 1)
- Cycle 34: (2, 9, 11, 14, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycles:
  <1, (14, 6), 11>
  <11, (9, 2), 3>
  <3, (9, 4), 7>
  <4, (9, 11), 14>
  <14, (11, 12), 5>
  <5, (13, 0), 12>
  <12, (5, 13), 6>
  <6, (8, 9), 4>
  <9, (4, 7), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore [9].
