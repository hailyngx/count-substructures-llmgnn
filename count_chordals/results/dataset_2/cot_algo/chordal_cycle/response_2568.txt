Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

      - Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 2 - 5
      - Cycle 2: 5 - 1 - 0 - 7 - 5
      - Cycle 3: 9 - 4 - 3 - 7 - 9
      - Cycle 4: 6 - 3 - 0 - 7 - 6
      - Cycle 5: 2 - 8 - 7 - 3 - 2
      - Cycle 6: 0 - 1 - 5 - 9 - 0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

      - Cycle 1: <1, (9, 6), 2>
      - Cycle 2: <2, (7, 5), 3>
      - Cycle 3: <4, (7, 9), 3>
      - Cycle 4: <6, (0, 7), 3>
      - Cycle 5: <8, (3, 7), 2>
      - Cycle 6: <10, (5, 9), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]
