Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph, but the only cycles of length 4 or more (chordal 4-cycles) are:
1. Cycle 1-6-5-4-1
2. Cycle 6-9-4-5-6
3. Cycle 6-1-4-5-6
4. Cycle 6-2-7-3-6
5. Cycle 9-8-2-7-9
6. Cycle 9-7-4-1-9
7. Cycle 1-8-9-4-1
8. Cycle 4-7-2-3-4

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for a chord:
- Cycle 1-6-5-4-1 has chord (6,4)
- Cycle 6-9-4-5-6 has chord (9,5)
- Cycle 6-1-4-5-6 has chord (1,5)
- Cycle 6-2-7-3-6 has chord (2,7)
- Cycle 9-8-2-7-9 has chord (8,7)
- Cycle 9-7-4-1-9 has chord (7,1)
- Cycle 1-8-9-4-1 has chord (8,4)
- Cycle 4-7-2-3-4 has chord (7,2)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph are:
<1, (6, 4), 5)>
<6, (9, 5), 4)>
<6, (1, 5), 4)>
<6, (2, 7), 3)>
<9, (8, 7), 2)>
<9, (7, 1), 4)>
<1, (8, 4), 9)>
<4, (7, 2), 3)>
