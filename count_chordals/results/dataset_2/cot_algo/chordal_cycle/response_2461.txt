Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle.

<6, 9, 21, 0> - Two chords: (6, 21) and (9, 0)
<6, 23, 8, 20> - Chord: (6, 8)
<6, 23, 8, 26> - Chord: (23, 8)
<6, 23, 18, 2> - Chord: (23, 18)
<6, 23, 18, 28> - Chord: (6, 18)
<6, 23, 18, 25> - Chord: (23, 18)
<6, 7, 23, 18> - Chord: (6, 23)
<6, 7, 23, 8> - Chord: (7, 23)
<6, 7, 11, 17> - Chord: (7, 11)
<6, 7, 11, 24> - Chord: (6, 11)
<6, 7, 11, 1> - Chord: (6, 11)
<9, 21, 0, 25> - Chord: (21, 0)
<14, 28, 23, 18> - Chord: (14, 23)
<14, 29, 1, 11> - Chord: (14, 1)
<17, 11, 1, 29> - Chord: (17, 1)
<8, 20, 22, 19> - Chord: (20, 19)
<23, 7, 11, 24> - Chord: (23, 11)
<23, 8, 26, 24> - Chord: (8, 26)
<23, 18, 2, 4> - Chord: (2, 4)
<23, 28, 14, 29> - Chord: (28, 29)
<2, 18, 23, 7> - Chord: (2, 23)
<15, 12, 2, 18> - Chord: (12, 18)
<18, 23, 7, 11> - Chord: (18, 7)
<20, 8, 15, 12> - Chord: (8, 15)
<26, 24, 11, 1> - Chord: (24, 11)
<28, 18, 23, 7> - Chord: (18, 7)
<16, 20, 8, 23> - Chord: (20, 8)
<21, 9, 6, 23> - Chord: (9, 6)
<27, 13, 19, 22> - Chord: (13, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 27 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [27].
