Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 10) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 13) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 7, 3, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 3, 12, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 13, 12, 7, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 13, 12, 0, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 14, 13, 5, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 14, 1, 6, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 9, 10, 7, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 9, 10, 11, 4)
- Cycle 9: (6, 9, 10, 11, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 9, 14, 13, 6)
- Cycle 11: (8, 5, 13, 12, 8)
- Cycle 12: (8, 5, 7, 3, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Unique chordal 4-cycle: <1, (6, 13), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

One chordal 4-cycle is found, so the final count is [1].
