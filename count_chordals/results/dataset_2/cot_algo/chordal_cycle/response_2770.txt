Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 4) (14, 17) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 16) (1, 3) (1, 7) (10, 15) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (4, 15) (4, 8) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 18) (5, 14) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 7) (6, 10) (6, 5) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 11) (12, 7) (12, 16) (18, 8) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (16, 17) (16, 12) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 9) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7)

- (3, 1, 7, 9)
- (15, 10, 11, 5)
- (15, 10, 6, 5)
- (15, 10, 6, 11)
- (15, 4, 8, 0)
- (15, 4, 8, 18)
- (15, 4, 8, 3)
- (14, 17, 16, 12)
- (14, 17, 16, 12)
- (14, 17, 16, 12)

- (1, 7, 12, 14)
- (10, 11, 5, 6)
- (10, 11, 5, 14)
- (10, 11, 5, 6)
- (10, 11, 5, 14)
- (8, 4, 15, 3)
- (8, 4, 15, 10)
- (8, 4, 15, 3)
- (8, 4, 15, 10)
- (5, 6, 10, 15)
- (5, 6, 10, 11)
- (5, 6, 10, 15)
- (5, 6, 10, 11)
- (6, 10, 15, 3)
- (6, 10, 15, 4)
- (6, 10, 15, 3)
- (6, 10, 15, 4)
- (7, 1, 3, 15)
- (7, 1, 3, 13)
- (7, 1, 3, 15)
- (7, 1, 3, 13)
- (12, 7, 1, 3)
- (12, 7, 1, 13)
- (12, 7, 1, 3)
- (12, 7, 1, 13)
- (18, 8, 3, 15)
- (18, 8, 3, 1)
- (18, 8, 3, 15)
- (18, 8, 3, 1)
- (19, 11, 5, 6)
- (19, 11, 5, 14)
- (19, 11, 5, 6)
- (19, 11, 5, 14)
- (16, 17, 14, 9)
- (16, 17, 14, 13)
- (16, 17, 14, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. 
- The cycles with exactly one chord are:
    < (3, 15), 10, 6 >
    < (3, 1), 7, 5 >
    < (15, 4), 8, 10 >
    < (14, 17), 16, 12 >
    < (17, 16), 12, 14 >

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final count is [5].
