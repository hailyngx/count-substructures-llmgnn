Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-4
- Cycle 2: 6-8-7-0
- Cycle 3: 4-2-8-1
- Cycle 4: 0-9-3-7
- Cycle 5: 3-2-4-5
- Cycle 6: 8-1-7-0

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-4 (Chord: 9-4)
- Cycle 4: 0-9-3-7 (Chord: 9-3)
- Cycle 5: 3-2-4-5 (Chord: 2-5)

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles = 6 - 3 = 3

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are <5, 9, 6, 4> (Chord: 9-4), <0, 9, 3, 7> (Chord: 9-3), and <3, 2, 4, 5> (Chord: 2-5).
