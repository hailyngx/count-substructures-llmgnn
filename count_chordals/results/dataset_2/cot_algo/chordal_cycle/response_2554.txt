Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 8) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 8) (13, 5) (13, 0) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 3) (10, 7) (10, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 8) (8, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 6, 14, 12, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 13, 0, 7, 5)
- Cycle 6: (9, 11, 0, 13, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 7, 4, 11, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 1, 10, 7, 9)
- Cycle 9: (4, 2, 12, 7, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 11, 0, 3, 4)
- Cycle 11: (7, 12, 2, 9, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 0, 13, 11, 7)
- Cycle 13: (12, 14, 6, 3, 12)
- Cycle 14: (6, 3, 8, 12, 6)
- Cycle 15: (6, 8, 0, 13, 6)
- Cycle 16: (13, 0, 11, 3, 13)
- Cycle 17: (0, 8, 14, 12, 0)
- Cycle 18: (3, 11, 0, 13, 3)
- Cycle 19: (11, 0, 7, 4, 11)
- Cycle 20: (10, 1, 9, 11, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, (5, 13), 9, (0, 7)> - Chord: (5, 13)
- <2, (9, 1), 7, (4, 11)> - Chord: (9, 1)
- <3, (5, 6), 14, (12, 5)> - Chord: (5, 6)
- <4, (9, 7), 0, (13, 9)> - Chord: (9, 7)
- <5, (7, 12), 2, (9, 7)> - Chord: (7, 12)
- <6, (4, 11), 0, (3, 4)> - Chord: (4, 11)
- <7, (12, 14), 6, (3, 12)> - Chord: (12, 14)
- <8, (6, 8), 0, (13, 6)> - Chord: (6, 8)
- <9, (13, 0), 11, (3, 13)> - Chord: (13, 0)
- <10, (0, 8), 12, (14, 0)> - Chord: (0, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
