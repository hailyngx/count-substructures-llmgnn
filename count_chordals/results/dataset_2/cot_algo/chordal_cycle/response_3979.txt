Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 7) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 23) (15, 6) (15, 17) (15, 24) (15, 28) (27, 17) (27, 9) (27, 16) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 28) (25, 20) (25, 9) (25, 19) (25, 11) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 19) (23, 12) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 3) (18, 20) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 29) (18, 3) (5, 18) (5, 29) (5, 16) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 17) (6, 7) (1, 26) (1, 24) (26, 1) (26, 16) (26, 7) (11, 25) (11, 23) (28, 15) (28, 20) (28, 9) (24, 15) (24, 1) (4, 10) (17, 15) (17, 27) (17, 20) (17, 6) (29, 20) (29, 18) (29, 5) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 9) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 3) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 21) (21, 10) (12, 23) (12, 2) (12, 14) (3, 2) (3, 18) (3, 7) (9, 27) (9, 25) (9, 28) (9, 0) (19, 25) (19, 23) (19, 14) (14, 12) (14, 19) (16, 27) (16, 5) (16, 26) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (13, 22, 23, 11, 25, 20, 18, 2, 3, 7, 6, 15, 24, 1, 26, 16, 5)
- Cycle 2: (20, 18, 2, 12, 23, 11, 25, 19, 14)
- Cycle 3: (15, 24, 1, 26, 7, 0, 10, 4)
- Cycle 4: (17, 27, 9, 25, 19, 14, 12, 2, 18, 29, 5, 16)
- Cycle 5: (6, 7, 3, 2, 18, 29, 20, 28, 9)
- Cycle 6: (7, 0, 10, 21)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (3, 7), 24, 26> with chord (3, 7)
- <2, 12, (14, 18), 23> with chord (14, 18)
- <4, 10, 21, 0> with chord (10, 21)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [3]

Final answer: [3]
