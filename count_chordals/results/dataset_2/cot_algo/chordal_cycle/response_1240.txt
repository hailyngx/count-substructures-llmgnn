Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 20) (16, 29) (16, 22) (16, 15) (9, 26) (9, 29) (9, 21) (26, 9) (26, 14) (26, 10) (26, 29) (14, 26) (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 28) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 3) (17, 22) (8, 20) (8, 1) (8, 18) (13, 25) (13, 1) (10, 26) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 12) (2, 12) (18, 8) (18, 20) (6, 21) (6, 23) (21, 9) (21, 6) (29, 16) (29, 9) (29, 26) (29, 19) (19, 29) (19, 15) (19, 25) (23, 6) (23, 4) (23, 25) (23, 0) (25, 13) (25, 19) (25, 23) (27, 5) (0, 10) (0, 23) (0, 3) (12, 10) (12, 2) (15, 16) (15, 19) (15, 5) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 20) (7, 14) (7, 24) (7, 28) (7, 1) (20, 11) (20, 8) (20, 18) (20, 3) (24, 7) (24, 28) (24, 5) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 7) (4, 23) (4, 28) (22, 16) (22, 17) (22, 28) (28, 14) (28, 7) (28, 24) (28, 4) (28, 22) (5, 27) (5, 15) (5, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles are as follows:
1. Cycle: 7-1-13-25-19-29-9-21-6-23-4-28-22-17-14-7
2. Cycle: 12-2-10-26-29-19-25-23-4-28-22-17-3-0-10
3. Cycle: 17-3-0-23-4-28-22-16-15-19-29-9-26-14-17
4. Cycle: 26-9-21-6-23-4-28-22-16-15-5-27-26
5. Cycle: 26-9-29-19-25-13-1-7-14-17-22-28-4-23-0-26
6. Cycle: 28-4-23-6-21-9-26-14-17-10-0-3-20-18-8-1-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <7, (1, 13), 25>
2. <12, (2, 10), 26>
3. <17, (3, 0), 23>
4. <26, (9, 29), 19>
5. <26, (9, 29), 19>
6. <28, (4, 23), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are [6] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
