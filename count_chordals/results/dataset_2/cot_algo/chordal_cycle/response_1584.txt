Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 27) (22, 13) (22, 26) (22, 29) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 6) (27, 13) (27, 0) (18, 1) (1, 18) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 6) (3, 19) (6, 0) (6, 3) (9, 29) (9, 20) (9, 16) (12, 21) (8, 23) (8, 20) (8, 29) (23, 8) (23, 25) (23, 10) (23, 19) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 19) (14, 20) (14, 2) (21, 3) (21, 12) (21, 17) (28, 17) (26, 22) (26, 10) (11, 14) (11, 15) (11, 17) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 5) (2, 4) (29, 22) (29, 9) (29, 8) (7, 15) (25, 23) (25, 5) (25, 10) (24, 4) (24, 20) (10, 23) (10, 26) (10, 25) (5, 2) (5, 25) (5, 16) (15, 1) (15, 11) (15, 7) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 17) (17, 21) (17, 28) (17, 11) (17, 16) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 24) (19, 3) (19, 23) (19, 14) (20, 3) (20, 9) (20, 8) (20, 14) (20, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (13, 2, 14, 0, 13)
- (13, 2, 14, 11, 15, 7, 13)
- (13, 2, 5, 25, 10, 23, 19, 14, 0, 6, 3, 1, 18, 13)
- (13, 27, 0, 6, 3, 1, 4, 24, 20, 9, 16, 17, 21, 12, 21, 3, 6, 0, 27)
- (22, 29, 8, 20, 3, 1, 18, 13, 27, 0, 14, 2, 13, 22)
- (22, 29, 8, 20, 3, 1, 4, 24, 20, 14, 11, 17, 21, 12, 21, 3, 6, 0, 27, 13, 22)
- (0, 27, 13, 18, 1, 4, 24, 20, 9, 29, 22, 26, 10, 25, 5, 2, 13, 27, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <13, 2, 14, 0, 13>
- <13, 27, 0, 6, 3, 1, 4, 24, 20, 9, 16, 17, 21, 12, 21, 3, 6, 0, 27, 13>
- <22, 29, 8, 20, 3, 1, 4, 24, 20, 14, 11, 17, 21, 12, 21, 3, 6, 0, 27, 13, 22>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [3] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
