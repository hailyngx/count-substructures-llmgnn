Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 19) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 10) (7, 18) (10, 7) (2, 15) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 16) (18, 7) (18, 6) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 7) (19, 2) (19, 5) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 15) (6, 18) (6, 1) (6, 8) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 15) (9, 14) (9, 12) (0, 15) (0, 5) (0, 8) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (17, 4) (17, 12) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 19, 2, 15, 6)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 6, 1, 14, 16)
- Cycle 3: (3, 15, 6, 8, 0, 5)
- Cycle 4: (3, 15, 2, 19, 5, 0)
- Cycle 5: (3, 15, 9, 12, 17, 4)
- Cycle 6: (15, 9, 12, 17, 7, 18)
- Cycle 7: (15, 2, 19, 7, 4, 17)
- Cycle 8: (15, 2, 13, 14, 1, 6)
- Cycle 9: (15, 6, 1, 14, 9, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord <16, 19>
- Cycle 2 has chord <1, 14>
- Cycle 3 has chord <6, 8>
- Cycle 4 has chord <2, 19>
- Cycle 5 has chord <9, 12>
- Cycle 6 has chord <9, 12>
- Cycle 7 has chord <2, 13>
- Cycle 8 has chord <2, 13>
- Cycle 9 has chord <6, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
