Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 13) (16, 4) (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 4) (15, 16) (15, 3) (15, 12) (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 0) (9, 19) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 10) (10, 11) (10, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 14) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 7) (17, 1) (17, 13) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 6) (6, 18) (6, 19) (6, 4) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 6) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 0) (12, 15) (12, 13) (19, 9) (19, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle <0, 2, 18, 4>
- Cycle <0, 7, 14, 8>
- Cycle <3, 4, 18, 6>
- Cycle <1, 10, 11, 16>
- Cycle <9, 19, 6, 18>
- Cycle <13, 17, 4, 18>
- Cycle <13, 14, 7, 0>
- Cycle <16, 11, 10, 1>
- Cycle <15, 12, 13, 14>
- Cycle <15, 16, 11, 0>
- Cycle <5, 9, 19, 6>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 2, 18, 4>, chord: (0, 18)
- <0, 7, 14, 8>, chord: (7, 14)
- <3, 4, 18, 6>, chord: (4, 18)
- <1, 10, 11, 16>, chord: (10, 11)
- <9, 19, 6, 18>, chord: (19, 6)
- <13, 17, 4, 18>, chord: (17, 4)
- <13, 14, 7, 0>, chord: (14, 7)
- <16, 11, 10, 1>, chord: (11, 10)
- <15, 12, 13, 14>, chord: (12, 13)
- <15, 16, 11, 0>, chord: (16, 11)
- <5, 9, 19, 6>, chord: (9, 19)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
