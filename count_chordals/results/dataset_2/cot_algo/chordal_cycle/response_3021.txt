Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 10) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 15) (7, 5) (8, 19) (8, 6) (12, 14) (12, 0) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 19) (6, 8) (6, 5) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 3) (3, 4) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 14) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 18) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 9) (15, 7) (15, 2) (9, 16) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 14) (13, 11) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 2) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 17) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 10) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 17) (10, 16) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 0, 12, 14, 3)
- Cycle 2: (0, 12, 14, 9, 1, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 12, 14, 9, 2, 15, 7, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 12, 14, 10, 4, 3, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 18, 10, 4, 3, 14, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 18, 3, 4, 10, 16, 5, 19, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 18, 3, 14, 9, 2, 15, 7, 5, 19, 0)
- Cycle 8: (0, 1, 9, 2, 15, 7, 5, 19, 8, 6, 5, 0)
- Cycle 9: (2, 15, 7, 5, 6, 8, 19, 17, 2)
- Cycle 10: (3, 0, 1, 9, 2, 15, 7, 5, 6, 8, 19, 3)

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (12, 9).
- Cycle 3 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (14, 7).
- Cycle 5 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (18, 10).
- Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (1, 6).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Thus, the final number of chordless cycles is: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<3, (0, 12)>
<0, (12, 14)>
<0, (18, 10)>
<2, (15, 7)>
<2, (9, 14)>
<7, (5, 19)>
