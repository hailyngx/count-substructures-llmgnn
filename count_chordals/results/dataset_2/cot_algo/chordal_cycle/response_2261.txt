Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Some cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 6-9-4-7-6
2. Cycle 2: 6-9-1-4-6
3. Cycle 3: 5-4-1-9-5
4. Cycle 4: 2-9-1-8-2

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (9, 4)
2. Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (9, 1)
3. Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (4, 9)
4. Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (9, 8)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found = 0

Therefore, the final count is [0].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <1, (9, 4), 7, 6)>
2. <2, (9, 1), 4, 6)>
3. <5, (4, 9), 1, 9)>
4. <6, (9, 8), 1, 2)>
