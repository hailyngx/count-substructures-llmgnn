Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-1-6-5
- Cycle 2: 9-4-6-9
- Cycle 3: 5-9-3-0
- Cycle 4: 5-8-7-1

Step 2: 
Checking for chords:
- In Cycle 1: Possible chord 1-6 or 5-6, (5, 6) is a chord.
- In Cycle 2: Possible chord 9-6 or 4-6, (9, 6) is a chord.
- In Cycle 3: No chords present.
- In Cycle 4: Possible chord 8-1 or 7-1, (8, 1) is a chord.

Step 3: 
Number of chordal 4-cycles found = [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <5, 6, 1, 5> with chord (5, 6)
2. <9, 6, 4, 9> with chord (9, 6)
