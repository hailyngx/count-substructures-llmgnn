Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 27) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 24) (12, 7) (12, 20) (12, 24) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 29) (13, 26) (13, 20) (13, 14) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 15) (26, 25) (26, 16) (6, 19) (21, 0) (21, 25) (25, 7) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 1) (16, 26) (28, 8) (28, 17) (28, 20) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 23) (0, 21) (0, 5) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 20) (19, 6) (19, 5) (19, 10) (2, 1) (2, 11) (8, 28) (8, 10) (8, 1) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 1) (17, 28) (17, 23) (17, 22) (3, 27) (3, 9) (3, 29) (1, 25) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 11) (15, 26) (15, 23) (15, 9) (14, 13) (14, 22) (14, 9) (22, 17) (22, 14) (20, 12) (20, 13) (20, 28) (20, 5) (23, 27) (23, 17) (23, 15) (23, 29) (9, 3) (9, 15) (9, 14) (24, 7) (24, 12) (24, 10) (10, 19) (10, 8) (10, 24) (29, 18) (29, 3) (29, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 24, 10, 19, 5, 20, 13, 26, 18, 4)
- Cycle 2: (7, 24, 10, 19, 5, 20, 13, 26, 18, 4, 27, 3, 29, 23, 17, 28, 8, 1, 25, 7)
- Cycle 3: (4, 27, 3, 29, 23, 17, 28, 8, 1, 25, 7, 12, 20, 13, 26, 18)
- Cycle 4: (18, 26, 15, 23, 29, 3, 27, 4, 18)
- Cycle 5: (26, 15, 23, 29, 3, 27, 4, 18, 26)
- Cycle 6: (20, 5, 19, 10, 24, 7, 12, 20)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, (10, 19), 5, 20, 13> has one chord (10, 19)
- <4, (7, 24), 10, 19, 5> has one chord (7, 24)
- <18, (26, 15), 23, 29, 3> has one chord (26, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found: [3].
