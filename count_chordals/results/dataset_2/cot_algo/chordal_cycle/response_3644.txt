- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 17, 14, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 12, 9, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 6, 12, 13, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 6, 14, 9, 1>

- Cycle 16: <2, 3, 5, 10, 2>
- Cycle 17: <3, 2, 10, 15, 3>
- Cycle 18: <3, 5, 10, 13, 3>
- Cycle 19: <4, 12, 6, 17, 4>
- Cycle 20: <4, 12, 9, 19, 4>
- Cycle 21: <5, 10, 13, 12, 5>
- Cycle 22: <6, 12, 9, 19, 6>
- Cycle 23: <6, 14, 17, 0, 6>
- Cycle 24: <7, 15, 10, 8, 7>
- Cycle 25: <7, 16, 12, 6, 7>
- Cycle 26: <8, 10, 13, 12, 8>
- Cycle 27: <9, 0, 17, 14, 9>
- Cycle 28: <9, 12, 6, 17, 9>
- Cycle 29: <9, 12, 13, 10, 9>
- Cycle 30: <9, 14, 17, 1, 9>
- Cycle 31: <9, 19, 1, 17, 9>
- Cycle 32: <10, 13, 12, 9, 10>
- Cycle 33: <10, 5, 3, 2, 10>
- Cycle 34: <12, 6, 14, 17, 12>
- Cycle 35: <12, 6, 17, 0, 12>
- Cycle 36: <12, 9, 1, 17, 12>
- Cycle 37: <12, 9, 19, 1, 12>
- Cycle 38: <13, 10, 8, 4, 13>
- Cycle 39: <15, 7, 2, 10, 15>
- Cycle 40: <15, 10, 13, 12, 15>
- Cycle 41: <16, 12, 9, 19, 16>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The cycles with exactly one chord are: 
  <1, 17, 6, 12, 1>  Chord: (1, 12)
  <1, 17, 6, 14, 1>  Chord: (1, 6)
  <1, 4, 12, 9, 1>   Chord: (4, 9)
  <1, 6, 17, 14, 1>  Chord: (6, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are [37] chordless 4-cycles in the graph, which are all the cycles listed above except for the ones with chords.
