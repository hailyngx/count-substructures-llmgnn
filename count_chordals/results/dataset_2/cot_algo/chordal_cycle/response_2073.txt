Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (12, 11) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 14) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 10) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (0, 6, 5, 4, 8, 0)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 6, 1, 2, 0)
        - Cycle 3: (0, 6, 7, 3, 0)
        - Cycle 4: (0, 8, 11, 12, 0)
        - Cycle 5: (0, 8, 4, 13, 0)
        - Cycle 6: (0, 7, 3, 14, 0)
        - Cycle 7: (4, 5, 6, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 8: (4, 8, 11, 12, 4)
        - Cycle 9: (4, 13, 12, 2, 4)
        - Cycle 10: (4, 13, 10, 14, 4)
        - Cycle 11: (5, 6, 7, 4, 5)
        - Cycle 12: (9, 4, 8, 13, 9)
        - Cycle 13: (9, 14, 12, 2, 9)
        - Cycle 14: (9, 14, 3, 7, 9)
        - Cycle 15: (13, 12, 14, 10, 13)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, (0, 6), 5>: Chord - (0, 6)
        - <2, (0, 6), 1>: Chord - (0, 6)
        - <3, (0, 6), 7>: Chord - (0, 6)
        - <4, (0, 8), 11>: Chord - (0, 8)
        - <5, (0, 8), 13>: Chord - (0, 8)
        - <6, (0, 7), 3>: Chord - (0, 7)
        - <7, (4, 5), 6>: Chord - (4, 5)
        - <8, (4, 8), 11>: Chord - (4, 8)
        - <9, (4, 13), 2>: Chord - (4, 13)
        - <10, (4, 13), 10>: Chord - (4, 13)
        - <11, (5, 6), 7>: Chord - (5, 6)
        - <12, (9, 4), 8>: Chord - (9, 4)
        - <13, (9, 14), 12>: Chord - (9, 14)
        - <14, (9, 14), 3>: Chord - (9, 14)
        - <15, (13, 12), 14>: Chord - (13, 12)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [15]

Therefore, there are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
