Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 2) (5, 14) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 14) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 1) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 9, 13, 12, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 9, 14, 10, 11, 8, 2)
- Cycle 3: (1, 7, 12, 13, 9, 10, 11, 8)
- Cycle 4: (1, 7, 12, 5, 2, 8, 11, 10)
- Cycle 5: (1, 6, 0, 7, 12, 13, 9, 4)
- Cycle 6: (1, 6, 0, 7, 2, 5, 12, 13)
- Cycle 7: (1, 0, 6, 3, 2, 7, 12, 5)
- Cycle 8: (1, 0, 7, 2, 8, 11, 10, 6)
- Cycle 9: (2, 7, 12, 13, 9, 14, 10, 11)
- Cycle 10: (2, 7, 12, 5, 14, 10, 11, 8)
- Cycle 11: (2, 8, 11, 10, 14, 5, 12, 7)
- Cycle 12: (2, 8, 11, 9, 13, 12, 7, 0)
- Cycle 13: (6, 0, 1, 4, 9, 10, 11, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (7, 12), 13, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 4, (9, 14), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (7, 12), 5, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (7, 2), 5, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, 0, (7, 12), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (6, 0), 7, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, 0, 6, (3, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, (0, 7), 2, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <2, 7, (12, 13), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <2, (7, 12), 5, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <2, 8, 11, (10, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <2, (8, 11), 9, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <6, 0, 1, (4, 9)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
