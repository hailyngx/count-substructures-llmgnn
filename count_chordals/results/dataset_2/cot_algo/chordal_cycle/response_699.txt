Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph where every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-9-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-9-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-4-9-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-7-9-1
- Cycle 6: 2-9-5-1-2
- Cycle 7: 2-9-6-1-2
- Cycle 8: 2-9-7-4-2
- Cycle 9: 2-1-4-6-2
- Cycle 10: 3-2-9-8-3
- Cycle 11: 3-2-1-6-3
- Cycle 12: 3-8-9-6-3
- Cycle 13: 4-9-5-1-4
- Cycle 14: 4-7-9-5-4
- Cycle 15: 4-7-6-1-4
- Cycle 16: 4-1-6-9-4
- Cycle 17: 6-9-5-1-6
- Cycle 18: 6-7-9-5-6
- Cycle 19: 6-1-5-9-6
- Cycle 20: 7-9-5-1-7
- Cycle 21: 8-9-6-1-8
- Cycle 22: 8-3-2-9-8
- Cycle 23: 8-3-2-1-8
- Cycle 24: 8-2-1-6-8

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (5, 2), 9>
- <1, (4, 9), 2>
- <1, (6, 9), 2>
- <1, (6, 4), 9>
- <1, (6, 7), 9>
- <2, (9, 5), 1>
- <2, (9, 6), 1>
- <2, (9, 7), 4>
- <2, (1, 4), 6>
- <3, (2, 9), 8>
- <3, (2, 1), 6>
- <3, (8, 9), 6>
- <4, (9, 5), 1>
- <4, (7, 9), 5>
- <4, (7, 6), 1>
- <4, (1, 6), 9>
- <6, (9, 5), 1>
- <6, (7, 9), 5>
- <6, (1, 5), 9>
- <7, (9, 5), 1>
- <8, (6, 1), 9>
- <8, (3, 2), 9>
- <8, (3, 2), 1>
- <8, (2, 1), 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 24 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [24].
