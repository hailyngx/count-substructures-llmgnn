Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1 <5, (6, 11), 7>: (5, 6, 11, 7) with chord (6, 11)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2 <5, (8, 7), 3>: (5, 8, 7, 3) with chord (8, 7)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3 <5, (9, 2), 10>: (5, 9, 2, 10) with chord (9, 2)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4 <4, (8, 7), 3>: (4, 8, 7, 3) with chord (8, 7)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5 <7, (11, 0), 10>: (7, 11, 0, 10) with chord (11, 0)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6 <8, (1, 14), 6>: (8, 1, 14, 6) with chord (1, 14)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7 <0, (13, 12), 2>: (0, 13, 12, 2) with chord (13, 12)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
