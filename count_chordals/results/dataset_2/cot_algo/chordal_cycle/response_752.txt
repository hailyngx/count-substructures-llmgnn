Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 14) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 27) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 20) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 22) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 17) (20, 9) (20, 25) (20, 19) (20, 23) (25, 20) (25, 27) (25, 12) (25, 10) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 12) (23, 20) (23, 8) (23, 27) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 28) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 24) (18, 28) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 17) (26, 18) (26, 2) (13, 21) (13, 6) (1, 17) (1, 29) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 22) (17, 1) (17, 6) (24, 18) (24, 0) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 20) (10, 25) (10, 21) (10, 14) (21, 13) (21, 10) (21, 29) (27, 5) (27, 25) (27, 23) (27, 1) (2, 5) (2, 22) (2, 26) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 12) (7, 3) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 10) (29, 1) (29, 21) (29, 6) (6, 11) (6, 15) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 29) (12, 25) (12, 8) (12, 0) (28, 4) (28, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 20, 25) with one possible chord (5, 20)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 14, 16) with no possible chords
- Cycle 3: (5, 19, 20, 25) with one possible chord (5, 20)
- Cycle 4: (5, 19, 20, 23) with one possible chord (5, 20)
- Cycle 5: (9, 14, 16, 20) with no possible chords
- Cycle 6: (9, 20, 25, 27) with one possible chord (9, 25)
- Cycle 7: (3, 15, 6, 11) with no possible chords
- Cycle 8: (3, 15, 17, 1) with no possible chords
- Cycle 9: (3, 22, 17, 1) with no possible chords
- Cycle 10: (20, 25, 27, 1) with one possible chord (20, 27)
- Cycle 11: (20, 23, 27, 1) with one possible chord (20, 27)
- Cycle 12: (23, 8, 12, 25) with no possible chords
- Cycle 13: (4, 8, 23, 27) with one possible chord (4, 23)
- Cycle 14: (4, 18, 24, 0) with no possible chords
- Cycle 15: (18, 26, 2, 5) with no possible chords
- Cycle 16: (13, 21, 10, 25) with no possible chords
- Cycle 17: (1, 17, 22, 3) with no possible chords
- Cycle 18: (1, 29, 6, 11) with no possible chords

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The only cycle with one chord is Cycle 1: (5, 9, 20, 25) with chord (5, 20)
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (5, 20), 9, 25>
