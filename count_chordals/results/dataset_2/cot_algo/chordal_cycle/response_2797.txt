Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 11) (8, 10) (8, 17) (8, 0) (7, 12) (7, 15) (7, 19) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 8) (14, 12) (14, 9) (3, 11) (3, 2) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 18) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 18) (17, 8) (17, 1) (17, 13) (13, 17) (13, 15) (13, 19) (13, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (5, 2) (5, 16) (6, 13) (6, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 16) (15, 7) (15, 13) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 13) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (10, 16) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 1) (18, 16) (18, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 4 - 9 - 14 - 12 - 4
- Cycle 2: 9 - 4 - 11 - 18 - 9 
- Cycle 3: 17 - 1 - 18 - 11 - 17
- Cycle 4: 16 - 1 - 17 - 13 - 16
- Cycle 5: 19 - 13 - 7 - 15 - 19
- Cycle 6: 10 - 8 - 0 - 12 - 10
- Cycle 7: 6 - 13 - 7 - 9 - 6
- Cycle 8: 5 - 16 - 1 - 17 - 5
- Cycle 9: 2 - 9 - 14 - 12 - 2
- Cycle 10: 3 - 2 - 9 - 4 - 3
- Cycle 11: 18 - 10 - 8 - 17 - 18
- Cycle 12: 11 - 18 - 1 - 16 - 11
- Cycle 13: 15 - 13 - 6 - 10 - 15
- Cycle 14: 7 - 9 - 4 - 11 - 7

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (9, 12) <4, (9, 12), 14>
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (4, 18) <9, (4, 18), 11>
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (1, 11) <17, (1, 11), 18>
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (1, 13) <16, (1, 13), 17>
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (7, 13) <19, (7, 13), 15>
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (8, 12) <10, (8, 12), 0>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (7, 9) <13, (7, 9), 6>
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (1, 17) <5, (1, 17), 16>
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (9, 12) <2, (9, 12), 14>
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (2, 9) <3, (2, 9), 4>
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (8, 17) <10, (8, 17), 18>
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (1, 16) <11, (1, 16), 18>
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (6, 13) <10, (6, 13), 15>
- Cycle 14 is chordal and has the chord: (9, 11) <7, (9, 11), 14>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [13].
