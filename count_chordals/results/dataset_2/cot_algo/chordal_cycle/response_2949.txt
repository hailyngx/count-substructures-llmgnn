Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 0) (26, 13) (26, 10) (0, 9) (0, 27) (0, 15) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 11) (6, 9) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 15) (4, 7) (4, 28) (4, 16) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 24) (7, 23) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 10) (14, 21) (17, 1) (17, 8) (21, 14) (21, 8) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 19) (22, 5) (13, 26) (13, 29) (13, 1) (13, 23) (1, 17) (1, 13) (1, 8) (18, 20) (18, 12) (18, 25) (20, 18) (20, 29) (20, 10) (29, 13) (29, 20) (29, 8) (11, 27) (11, 23) (11, 25) (23, 7) (23, 13) (23, 11) (23, 3) (23, 12) (5, 22) (5, 19) (5, 10) (19, 22) (19, 5) (25, 18) (25, 11) (25, 24) (10, 26) (10, 14) (10, 20) (10, 5) (10, 12) (16, 4) (24, 7) (24, 25) (15, 0) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 12) (28, 4) (28, 14) (12, 18) (12, 23) (12, 10) (12, 15) (3, 6) (3, 23) (8, 17) (8, 21) (8, 1) (8, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. <6, 9, 22, 14>
2. <6, 9, 0, 27>
3. <6, 9, 22, 5>
4. <6, 15, 0, 27>
5. <4, 7, 24, 25>
6. <4, 15, 0, 27>
7. <23, 7, 24, 25>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <6, 9, 22, 14> has a chord (9, 22) and a chordless cycle <6, 22, 14, 9>.
- <6, 9, 0, 27> has a chord (9, 0) and a chordless cycle <6, 0, 27, 9>.
- <6, 9, 22, 5> has a chord (9, 22) and a chordless cycle <6, 22, 5, 9>.
- <6, 15, 0, 27> has a chord (15, 0) and a chordless cycle <6, 0, 27, 15>.
- <4, 7, 24, 25> has a chord (7, 24) and a chordless cycle <4, 24, 25, 7>.
- <4, 15, 0, 27> has a chord (15, 0) and a chordless cycle <4, 0, 27, 15>.
- <23, 7, 24, 25> has a chord (7, 24) and a chordless cycle <23, 24, 25, 7>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which are all mentioned above:

There are [7] chordless cycles in the given graph.
