Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: 0-4-9-6-0
2. Cycle 2: 1-3-6-7-1
3. Cycle 3: 2-8-7-1-2
4. Cycle 4: 3-5-9-4-3
5. Cycle 5: 3-6-7-4-3
6. Cycle 6: 3-0-4-9-3
7. Cycle 7: 3-1-7-8-3
8. Cycle 8: 3-2-1-3
9. Cycle 9: 4-7-1-3-4
10. Cycle 10: 6-7-1-2-6
11. Cycle 11: 8-7-4-9-8
12. Cycle 12: 8-2-1-3-8
13. Cycle 13: 0-2-1-3-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the above cycles, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, (3, 6), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As we only found one chordal 4-cycle, the count of chordless cycles is [12].
