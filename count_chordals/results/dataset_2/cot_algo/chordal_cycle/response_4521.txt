Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. Cycle 1-5-6-7-1 with edges (1, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 1)
2. Cycle 1-3-9-8-7-1 with edges (1, 3), (3, 9), (9, 8), (8, 7), (7, 1)
3. Cycle 0-5-1-4-0 with edges (0, 5), (5, 1), (1, 4), (4, 0)
4. Cycle 0-5-7-8-0 with edges (0, 5), (5, 7), (7, 8), (8, 0)
5. Cycle 0-9-8-2-0 with edges (0, 9), (9, 8), (8, 2), (2, 0)
6. Cycle 0-9-3-1-4-0 with edges (0, 9), (9, 3), (3, 1), (1, 4), (4, 0)
7. Cycle 0-9-2-4-0 with edges (0, 9), (9, 2), (2, 4), (4, 0)
8. Cycle 3-9-2-4-3 with edges (3, 9), (9, 2), (2, 4), (4, 3)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. Cycle 0-9-2-4-0 with chord (9, 2)
2. Cycle 0-9-3-1-4-0 with chord (3, 1)

Step 3:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles: [<0-9-2-4-0>, <0-9-3-1-4-0>]. So, the final count is [2].
