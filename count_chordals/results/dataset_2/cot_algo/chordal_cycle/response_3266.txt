Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 11) (11, 12) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 10) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 10) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 0-4-2-6-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-4-10-7-0
        - Cycle 3: 0-1-11-3-0
        - Cycle 4: 0-1-13-5-0
        - Cycle 5: 0-7-12-6-0
        - Cycle 6: 1-10-4-2-1
        - Cycle 7: 1-11-2-8-1
        - Cycle 8: 1-13-7-14-1
        - Cycle 9: 2-6-5-13-2
        - Cycle 10: 2-8-9-12-2
        - Cycle 11: 2-3-9-8-2
        - Cycle 12: 2-11-3-2
        - Cycle 13: 3-9-12-11-3
        - Cycle 14: 3-11-13-1-3
        - Cycle 15: 4-0-1-13-4
        - Cycle 16: 4-10-14-7-4
        - Cycle 17: 5-6-12-7-5
        - Cycle 18: 7-10-14-13-7
        - Cycle 19: 8-2-6-12-8
        - Cycle 20: 9-8-10-7-9
        - Cycle 21: 11-12-6-5-11
        - Cycle 22: 11-13-7-10-11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <0,1,4,10>
        - <1,2,8,13>
        - <0,1,3,11>
        - <0,1,5,13>
        - <5,6,7,12>
        - <1,4,10,7>
        - <2,6,12,8>
        - <7,9,10,14>
        - <4,0,1,13>
        - <5,6,12,7>
        - <2,3,9,8>
        - <13,1,3,11>
        - <11,3,9,13>
        - <4,10,14,7>
        - <6,5,12,7>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
         There are 15 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [15].
