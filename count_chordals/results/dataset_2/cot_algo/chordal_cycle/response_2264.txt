Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 7, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 7, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 7, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 7, 4, 1, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 3, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 6, 1, 4, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 4, 3, 6, 7)
- Cycle 10: (6, 1, 4, 3, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (7, 9).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (1, 5).
- Cycle 4 has a chord (3, 5).
- Cycle 5 has a chord (1, 7).
- Cycle 6 has a chord (1, 4).
- Cycle 7 has a chord (1, 6).
- Cycle 8 has a chord (1, 4).
- Cycle 9 has a chord (3, 7).
- Cycle 10 has a chord (1, 4).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
We found 1 chordless cycle: Cycle 1

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, 9, 7, 6>.
