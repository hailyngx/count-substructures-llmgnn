Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 19) (11, 18) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 9) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 18) (4, 14) (7, 10) (8, 4) (8, 0) (18, 11) (18, 4) (18, 14) (18, 0) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 1) (19, 11) (19, 5) (19, 12) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 9) (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 18) (0, 17) (6, 15) (6, 12) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 2) (2, 5) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 18) (14, 2) (14, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 9) (12, 19) (12, 6) (9, 16) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 3-11-19-5-3
- Cycle 2: 3-16-9-17-3
- Cycle 3: 3-15-6-12-3
- Cycle 4: 3-4-18-14-3
- Cycle 5: 3-4-8-0-3

Step 2:
Checking for each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <3, (11, 19), 5> (Chord: 11-19)
- Cycle 2: <3, (16, 9), 17> (Chord: 16-9)
- Cycle 3: <3, (15, 6), 12> (Chord: 15-6)
- Cycle 4: <3, (4, 18), 14> (Chord: 4-18)
- Cycle 5: <3, (4, 8), 0> (Chord: 4-8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal cycles found, which is 5.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
