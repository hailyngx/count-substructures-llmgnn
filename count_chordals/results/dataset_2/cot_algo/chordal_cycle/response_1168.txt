Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 8, 4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 3, 0, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 7, 0, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 3, 7, 0, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 2, 0, 5, 6)
- Cycle 6: (9, 8, 4, 1, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 7, 0, 3, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 6, 2, 0, 9)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 0, 5, 1, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 1, 8, 9, 4)
- Cycle 12: (8, 9, 7, 0, 8)
- Cycle 13: (8, 4, 1, 0, 8)
- Cycle 14: (5, 2, 0, 1, 5)
- Cycle 15: (5, 1, 0, 4, 5)
- Cycle 16: (2, 0, 5, 1, 2)
- Cycle 17: (2, 6, 9, 8, 2)
- Cycle 18: (0, 3, 7, 9, 0)
- Cycle 19: (0, 7, 9, 6, 0)
- Cycle 20: (0, 6, 2, 5, 0)
- Cycle 21: (0, 5, 1, 4, 0)
- Cycle 22: (0, 1, 8, 4, 0)
- Cycle 23: (7, 9, 8, 4, 7)
- Cycle 24: (7, 0, 3, 9, 7)
- Cycle 25: (7, 6, 2, 0, 7)
- Cycle 26: (7, 3, 9, 6, 7)
- Cycle 27: (3, 0, 1, 4, 3)
- Cycle 28: (3, 7, 9, 8, 3)
- Cycle 29: (3, 9, 6, 2, 3)
- Cycle 30: (1, 8, 9, 7, 1)
- Cycle 31: (1, 4, 0, 5, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <6, (9, 8), 4, 6>
- <9, (7, 0), 3, 9>
- <4, (1, 8), 9, 4>
- <8, (4, 1), 9, 8>
- <5, (1, 0), 4, 5>
- <2, (6, 9), 8, 2>
- <0, (3, 7), 9, 0>
- <7, (9, 6), 3, 7>
- <3, (0, 1), 4, 3>
- <1, (8, 9), 7, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
