Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, including:
1. Cycle <5, 1, 7, 0, 5>
2. Cycle <5, 0, 4, 7, 5>
3. Cycle <9, 2, 7, 4, 9>
4. Cycle <4, 0, 7, 2, 4>
5. Cycle <6, 3, 0, 5, 6>
6. Cycle <2, 1, 7, 4, 2>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle <5, 1, 7, 0, 5> has one chord (1, 7)
- Cycle <5, 0, 4, 7, 5> has one chord (0, 4)
- Cycle <9, 2, 7, 4, 9> has one chord (2, 7)
- Cycle <4, 0, 7, 2, 4> has one chord (0, 7)
- Cycle <6, 3, 0, 5, 6> has one chord (3, 5)
- Cycle <2, 1, 7, 4, 2> has one chord (1, 4)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <5, 1, 7, 0, 5> (chord: (1, 7))
2. <5, 0, 4, 7, 5> (chord: (0, 4))
3. <9, 2, 7, 4, 9> (chord: (2, 7))
4. <4, 0, 7, 2, 4> (chord: (0, 7))
5. <6, 3, 0, 5, 6> (chord: (3, 5))
6. <2, 1, 7, 4, 2> (chord: (1, 4))
