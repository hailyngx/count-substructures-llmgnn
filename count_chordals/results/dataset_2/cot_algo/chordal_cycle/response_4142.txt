Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 26) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 23) (16, 9) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 28) (5, 7) (5, 20) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 24) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 25) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 14) (15, 27) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 6) (0, 12) (0, 6) (20, 5) (20, 17) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 27) (2, 18) (2, 25) (18, 2) (18, 6) (12, 0) (12, 28) (12, 22) (28, 5) (28, 12) (26, 11) (26, 10) (26, 8) (17, 20) (17, 13) (1, 13) (1, 22) (19, 5) (19, 21) (19, 10) (23, 16) (13, 17) (13, 1) (10, 26) (10, 19) (10, 21) (10, 22) (21, 19) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 29) (24, 11) (24, 9) (24, 8) (24, 29) (3, 9) (3, 7) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 22) (22, 12) (22, 1) (22, 10) (22, 21) (22, 14) (8, 26) (8, 24) (8, 29) (6, 27) (6, 0) (6, 18) (6, 25) (29, 21) (29, 24) (29, 8) (25, 4) (25, 2) (25, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 9, 16, 2, 5)
- (5, 9, 16, 23, 5)
- (9, 16, 2, 15, 9)
- (9, 16, 2, 27, 9)
- (5, 7, 3, 9, 5)
- (9, 24, 11, 16, 9)
- (20, 5, 9, 24, 20)
- (2, 15, 27, 6, 2)
- (2, 27, 6, 18, 2)
- (2, 27, 6, 25, 2)
- (2, 27, 6, 18, 2)
- (2, 27, 6, 25, 2)
- (27, 15, 2, 16, 27)
- (27, 15, 2, 25, 27)
- (5, 20, 17, 13, 5)
- (2, 18, 6, 0, 2)
- (2, 18, 6, 27, 2)
- (2, 18, 6, 25, 2)
- (12, 0, 6, 27, 12)
- (12, 0, 6, 18, 12)
- (9, 16, 2, 27, 9)
- (10, 26, 11, 24, 10)
- (10, 26, 11, 16, 10)
- (10, 19, 5, 7, 10)
- (10, 19, 5, 28, 10)
- (21, 19, 5, 9, 21)
- (2, 16, 11, 26, 2)
- (8, 26, 11, 16, 8)
- (8, 24, 9, 16, 8)
- (6, 27, 15, 2, 6)
- (6, 27, 15, 27, 6)
- (6, 27, 2, 15, 6)
- (6, 25, 2, 16, 6)
- (6, 25, 2, 27, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycle found:
<5, 9, 16, 2> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
