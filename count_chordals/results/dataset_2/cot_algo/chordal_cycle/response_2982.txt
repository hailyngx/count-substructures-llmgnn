Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 3) (16, 26) (16, 10) (16, 20) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 18) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 2) (27, 28) (18, 15) (18, 14) (18, 17) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 21) (23, 22) (23, 3) (23, 29) (23, 21) (23, 12) (10, 16) (10, 17) (17, 18) (17, 10) (17, 20) (2, 27) (2, 5) (2, 4) (28, 27) (28, 29) (28, 0) (29, 23) (29, 28) (29, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 22) (6, 29) (6, 19) (6, 4) (13, 25) (13, 1) (26, 16) (26, 25) (24, 7) (24, 9) (24, 19) (24, 21) (20, 16) (20, 17) (20, 12) (7, 24) (7, 25) (7, 9) (25, 13) (25, 26) (25, 7) (25, 8) (8, 11) (8, 25) (8, 12) (9, 24) (9, 7) (4, 11) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 6) (21, 22) (21, 23) (21, 24) (0, 15) (0, 28) (0, 3) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 24) (1, 13) (3, 16) (3, 23) (3, 0) (14, 18) (12, 23) (12, 5) (12, 20) (12, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (2, 27, 4, 11)  
- Cycle 2: (2, 27, 4, 6)  
- Cycle 3: (2, 5, 12, 23)  
- Cycle 4: (2, 5, 12, 20)  
- Cycle 5: (2, 5, 12, 8)  
- Cycle 6: (2, 27, 4, 11)  
- Cycle 7: (2, 27, 4, 6)  
- Cycle 8: (2, 5, 12, 23)  
- Cycle 9: (2, 5, 12, 20)  
- Cycle 10: (2, 5, 12, 8)  
- Cycle 11: (16, 3, 0, 15)  
- Cycle 12: (16, 3, 0, 28)  
- Cycle 13: (16, 3, 23, 12)  
- Cycle 14: (16, 3, 23, 29)  
- Cycle 15: (16, 3, 0, 15)  
- Cycle 16: (16, 3, 0, 28)  
- Cycle 17: (16, 3, 23, 12)  
- Cycle 18: (16, 3, 23, 29)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <2, (27, 4), 11>  
- <2, (5, 12), 23>  
- <2, (27, 4), 11>  
- <2, (5, 12), 23>  
- <16, (3, 0), 15>  
- <16, (3, 23), 12>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordal 4-cycles in this graph. Therefore, the final count is [0].
