Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 1) (22, 13) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 28) (0, 27) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 12) (27, 0) (27, 10) (2, 29) (2, 28) (29, 2) (29, 7) (29, 26) (29, 15) (18, 0) (18, 7) (14, 23) (14, 28) (14, 9) (17, 9) (15, 29) (15, 5) (15, 24) (20, 1) (20, 23) (20, 5) (20, 16) (5, 15) (5, 20) (5, 26) (5, 25) (16, 22) (16, 20) (16, 28) (28, 22) (28, 2) (28, 14) (28, 16) (28, 24) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 19) (23, 14) (23, 20) (23, 11) (23, 9) (23, 19) (25, 5) (25, 6) (25, 26) (26, 29) (26, 5) (26, 25) (19, 22) (19, 11) (19, 23) (19, 3) (19, 1) (7, 29) (7, 18) (7, 11) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 10) (1, 13) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 4) (10, 27) (10, 3) (10, 4) (12, 0) (4, 1) (4, 10) (6, 25) (6, 8) (24, 15) (24, 28) (24, 21) (9, 14) (9, 17) (9, 23) (8, 6) (8, 21) (21, 24) (21, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (13, 22, 16, 20, 1, 13)
- Cycle 2: (13, 22, 16, 28, 14, 23, 11, 19, 1, 13)
- Cycle 3: (22, 16, 28, 14, 23, 19, 11, 7, 29, 2, 22)
- Cycle 4: (22, 28, 14, 23, 19, 1, 20, 16, 22)
- Cycle 5: (0, 3, 19, 22, 28, 16, 20, 5, 26, 29, 7, 18, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 18, 7, 29, 26, 5, 15, 24, 28, 14, 9, 17, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 12, 27, 10, 3, 19, 1, 20, 23, 14, 28, 24, 15, 0)
- Cycle 8: (27, 10, 3, 19, 23, 14, 28, 24, 21, 8, 6, 25, 26, 29, 7, 18, 27)
- Cycle 9: (2, 29, 7, 18, 0, 12, 27, 10, 4, 1, 20, 5, 26, 25, 6, 8, 21, 24, 15, 2)
- Cycle 10: (14, 23, 11, 7, 29, 26, 5, 15, 24, 21, 8, 6, 25, 26, 29, 2, 28, 16, 22, 19, 14)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <13, (20, 16), 22, 1, 13>
- <13, (19, 23), 22, 16, 28, 14, 11, 1>
- <22, (14, 28), 23, 19, 16, 29, 2>
- <22, (16, 28), 20, 1, 19, 23>
- <0, (3, 19), 22, 28, 16, 5, 26, 29, 7, 18>
- <0, (7, 18), 29, 26, 5, 15, 24, 28, 14, 9, 17>
- <0, (12, 27), 10, 3, 19, 1, 20, 23, 28, 24, 15>
- <27, (3, 19), 23, 14, 28, 24, 21, 8, 6, 25, 26, 10>
- <2, (7, 18), 0, 12, 27, 10, 4, 1, 20, 5, 26, 25, 6, 8, 21, 24, 15>
- <14, (11, 23), 7, 29, 26, 5, 15, 24, 21, 8, 6, 25, 26, 2, 28, 16, 22, 19>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
