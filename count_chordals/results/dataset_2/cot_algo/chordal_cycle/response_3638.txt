Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 1) (4, 17) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 16) (13, 19) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 3) (15, 8) (15, 6) (16, 5) (16, 19) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 3) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 19) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: (0, 10, 17, 4, 0)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 10, 17, 9, 8, 0)
        - Cycle 3: (0, 10, 14, 3, 9, 17, 4, 0)
        - Cycle 4: (0, 14, 3, 9, 8, 0)
        - Cycle 5: (0, 18, 5, 11, 6, 17, 4, 0)
        - Cycle 6: (1, 18, 0, 10, 17, 9, 3, 14, 1)
        - Cycle 7: (1, 12, 11, 5, 18, 0, 14, 7, 1)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
  - Only Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: Chord (9, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = [6]

List of unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<0, 10, 17, 4, (14, 3)>
<0, 10, 17, 9, 8, (0, 14)>
<0, 18, 5, 11, 6, (17, 4)>
<1, 18, 0, 10, 17, 9, 3, 14, 1>
<1, 12, 11, 5, 18, 0, 14, 7, 1>
