Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 12) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 24) (15, 21) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 24) (18, 21) (22, 18) (22, 7) (22, 12) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 19) (6, 28) (6, 21) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 1) (28, 19) (21, 15) (21, 18) (21, 6) (21, 28) (19, 2) (19, 28) (26, 5) (17, 29) (17, 23) (29, 3) (29, 17) (29, 23) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 26) (5, 25) (5, 20) (20, 5) (20, 9) (4, 13) (4, 27) (4, 0) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 7) (11, 9) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 2) (7, 22) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 27) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 24) (16, 25) (16, 23) (16, 14) (0, 28) (0, 4) (24, 15) (24, 18) (24, 16) (24, 9) (25, 5) (25, 16) (1, 28) (14, 27) (14, 16) (9, 20) (9, 11) (9, 24) (9, 23) (23, 17) (23, 29) (23, 16) (23, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 21, 6, 28, 19, 2, 18) with chords (6, 18)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 21, 28, 19, 2, 5, 26) with chords (21, 5)
- Cycle 3: (7, 27, 4, 13, 7, 8, 12, 2) with chords (13, 12)
- Cycle 4: (7, 8, 13, 5, 2, 19, 28, 6) with chords (13, 19)
- Cycle 5: (7, 27, 14, 16, 25, 5, 13, 4) with chords (14, 13)
- Cycle 6: (9, 20, 5, 13, 8, 12, 2, 19) with chords (5, 12)
- Cycle 7: (9, 20, 5, 25, 16, 14, 27, 4) with chords (5, 16)
- Cycle 8: (9, 23, 16, 14, 27, 7, 22, 12) with chords (16, 7)
- Cycle 9: (9, 23, 16, 14, 27, 4, 0, 28) with chords (16, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (6, 18), 6>
- <2, (21, 5), 6>
- <3, (13, 12), 6>
- <4, (13, 19), 6>
- <5, (14, 13), 6>
- <6, (5, 12), 6>
- <7, (5, 16), 6>
- <8, (16, 7), 6>
- <9, (16, 0), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
