Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-1-6-0
- Cycle 2: 1-4-7-9-1
- Cycle 3: 2-5-9-6-2
- Cycle 4: 3-0-4-8-3
- Cycle 5: 8-1-7-4-8

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (0, 8)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (1, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
As there are no chordless cycles in this graph, the count is [0].
