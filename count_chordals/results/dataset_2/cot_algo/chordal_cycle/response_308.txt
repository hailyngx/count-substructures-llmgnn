Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 16) (10, 19) (10, 9) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 8) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 18) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 10) (19, 5) (19, 12) (16, 15) (16, 5) (16, 12) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 9) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 13) (11, 0) (11, 13) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 9) (9, 10) (9, 17) (9, 1) (9, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 15) (18, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 6, 2, 8, 3, 7, 5, 19, 10, 9, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 4, 14, 4, 3, 7, 5, 16, 15, 18, 8, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 7, 0, 11, 13, 12, 17, 8, 18, 15, 16, 5, 19, 10, 9, 1, 6, 2, 8, 17, 12, 13, 11, 0, 7, 5, 16, 12, 13)

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has one chord: <2, 8>.
- Cycle 3 has one chord: <8, 18>.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have a total of [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <2, 8> in cycle (1, 4, 6, 2, 8, 3, 7, 5, 19, 10, 9, 1)
- <8, 18> in cycle (1, 4, 14, 4, 3, 7, 5, 16, 15, 18, 8, 2, 6, 1)
