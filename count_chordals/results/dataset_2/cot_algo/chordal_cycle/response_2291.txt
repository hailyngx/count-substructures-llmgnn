Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 5-9-4-7-5
2. Cycle 2: 5-9-0-3-5
3. Cycle 3: 5-8-3-0-5
4. Cycle 4: 5-2-3-8-5
5. Cycle 5: 5-0-6-7-5
6. Cycle 6: 9-4-0-3-9
7. Cycle 7: 9-7-6-4-9
8. Cycle 8: 4-1-7-6-4
9. Cycle 9: 7-1-6-4-7
10. Cycle 10: 1-4-0-3-1

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 9-7
- Cycle 2 has a chord 9-0
- Cycle 3 has a chord 8-3
- Cycle 4 has a chord 5-3
- Cycle 5 has a chord 0-6
- Cycle 6 has a chord 4-0
- Cycle 7 has a chord 7-6
- Cycle 8 has a chord 1-7
- Cycle 9 has a chord 1-6
- Cycle 10 has a chord 4-0

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
There are no unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
