Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 26) (7, 4) (7, 0) (18, 0) (18, 1) (22, 10) (8, 23) (8, 27) (8, 29) (13, 3) (13, 15) (13, 19) (14, 19) (14, 20) (14, 29) (14, 5) (17, 6) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 9) (23, 8) (23, 5) (23, 12) (26, 4) (26, 28) (26, 21) (26, 11) (28, 26) (28, 25) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 15) (0, 19) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 3) (25, 28) (25, 27) (20, 14) (20, 29) (20, 9) (20, 2) (29, 8) (29, 14) (29, 20) (29, 24) (3, 13) (3, 17) (3, 16) (3, 11) (11, 26) (11, 3) (11, 19) (12, 4) (12, 23) (12, 2) (27, 8) (27, 25) (27, 1) (2, 20) (2, 12) (10, 22) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 24) (1, 18) (1, 16) (1, 27) (1, 6) (6, 17) (6, 1) (6, 19) (9, 17) (9, 20) (5, 14) (5, 23) (5, 21) (19, 13) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 6) (21, 26) (21, 5) (21, 24) (24, 29) (24, 15) (24, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all edges existing. These cycles are:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 0, 18, 1)
- Cycle 2: (7, 0, 18, 1, 16)
- Cycle 3: (7, 0, 18, 1, 27)
- Cycle 4: (7, 0, 15, 13, 3)
- Cycle 5: (7, 0, 15, 13, 19)
- Cycle 6: (7, 0, 15, 24, 29)
- Cycle 7: (4, 26, 28, 25, 27)
- Cycle 8: (4, 26, 28, 25, 8)
- Cycle 9: (4, 26, 28, 25, 27)
- Cycle 10: (4, 7, 0, 15, 24)
- Cycle 11: (4, 7, 0, 19, 13)
- Cycle 12: (4, 7, 0, 19, 14)
- Cycle 13: (4, 7, 0, 19, 6)
- Cycle 14: (4, 26, 28, 25, 8)
- Cycle 15: (7, 0, 15, 24, 21)
- Cycle 16: (7, 0, 19, 13, 3)
- Cycle 17: (7, 0, 19, 14, 20)
- Cycle 18: (7, 0, 19, 14, 29)
- Cycle 19: (7, 0, 19, 14, 5)
- Cycle 20: (7, 0, 19, 6, 17)
- Cycle 21: (4, 7, 0, 19, 11)
- Cycle 22: (4, 26, 28, 25, 27)

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, there is only one chordal 4-cycle: <1, (18, 0), 27>

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [1].
