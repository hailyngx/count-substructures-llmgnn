Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 17) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 14) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 12) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 19) (10, 5) (0, 16) (6, 17) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 9) (14, 16) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 5) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 19) (1, 18) (2, 16) (2, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 17) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 6) (13, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 15) (12, 17) (12, 18) (18, 1) (18, 12) (19, 10) (19, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- Cycle 1: (4, 10, 5, 11, 4)  
- Cycle 2: (3, 14, 16, 2, 3)  
- Cycle 3: (6, 17, 12, 15, 6)  
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 11, 10, 1)  
- Cycle 5: (16, 14, 4, 10, 16)  
- Cycle 6: (17, 11, 5, 1, 17)  
- Cycle 7: (6, 2, 16, 14, 6)  
- Cycle 8: (12, 17, 6, 13, 12)  
- Cycle 9: (18, 1, 5, 14, 18)  
- Cycle 10: (19, 10, 4, 14, 19)  

Step 2: Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:  
1. Cycle 1 (4, 10, 5, 11, 4): Chord (10, 11)  
2. Cycle 2 (3, 14, 16, 2, 3): Chord (14, 2)  
3. Cycle 3 (6, 17, 12, 15, 6): Chord (17, 15)  
4. Cycle 4 (1, 5, 11, 10, 1): Chord (5, 10)  
5. Cycle 5 (16, 14, 4, 10, 16): Chord (14, 10)  
6. Cycle 6 (17, 11, 5, 1, 17): Chord (11, 1)  
7. Cycle 7 (6, 2, 16, 14, 6): Chord (2, 16)  
8. Cycle 8 (12, 17, 6, 13, 12): Chord (17, 6)  
9. Cycle 9 (18, 1, 5, 14, 18): Chord (1, 14)  
10. Cycle 10 (19, 10, 4, 14, 19): Chord (10, 14)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:  
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <4, 10, 5, 11> (Chord: (10, 11))
2. <3, 14, 16, 2> (Chord: (14, 2))
3. <6, 17, 12, 15> (Chord: (17, 15))
4. <1, 5, 11, 10> (Chord: (5, 10))
5. <16, 14, 4, 10> (Chord: (14, 10))
6. <17, 11, 5, 1> (Chord: (11, 1))
7. <6, 2, 16, 14> (Chord: (2, 16))
8. <12, 17, 6, 13> (Chord: (17, 6))
9. <18, 1, 5, 14> (Chord: (1, 14))
10. <19, 10, 4, 14> (Chord: (10, 14))
