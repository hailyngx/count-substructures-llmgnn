Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 2, 4) with edges (4, 7), (7, 2), and (2, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 1, 4) with edges (4, 7), (7, 1), and (1, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 6, 4) with edges (4, 7), (7, 6), and (6, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 9, 4) with edges (4, 7), (7, 9), and (9, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 1, 6, 7) with edges (7, 1), (1, 6), and (6, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 1, 0, 7) with edges (7, 1), (1, 0), and (0, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 9, 8, 7) with edges (7, 9), (9, 8), and (8, 7)
- Cycle 8: (1, 3, 2, 1) with edges (1, 3), (3, 2), and (2, 1)
- Cycle 9: (2, 8, 9, 2) with edges (2, 8), (8, 9), and (9, 2)
- Cycle 10: (6, 1, 5, 6) with edges (6, 1), (1, 5), and (5, 6)
- Cycle 11: (5, 3, 1, 5) with edges (5, 3), (3, 1), and (1, 5)
- Cycle 12: (3, 2, 4, 3) with edges (3, 2), (2, 4), and (4, 3)
- Cycle 13: (2, 8, 5, 2) with edges (2, 8), (8, 5), and (5, 2)
- Cycle 14: (8, 0, 1, 8) with edges (8, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 8)
- Cycle 15: (8, 6, 7, 8) with edges (8, 6), (6, 7), and (7, 8)
- Cycle 16: (9, 8, 2, 9) with edges (9, 8), (8, 2), and (2, 9)
- Cycle 17: (6, 0, 4, 6) with edges (6, 0), (0, 4), and (4, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (4, 2), 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (4, 7), 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (5, 1), 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (7, 1), 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (3, 1), 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (1, 6), 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (6, 7), 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (8, 0), 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (9, 8), 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- The number of chordless cycles is [8].
