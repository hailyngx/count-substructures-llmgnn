Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 0) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 2) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 2) (6, 11) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 8, 13, 9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 2, 9, 1)
- Cycle 3: (3, 6, 13, 9, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 6, 2, 9, 3)
- Cycle 5: (8, 13, 14, 12, 8)
- Cycle 6: (4, 0, 7, 5, 4)
- Cycle 7: (7, 0, 14, 12, 7)
- Cycle 8: (9, 1, 7, 5, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 13, 6, 11, 9)
- Cycle 10: (2, 4, 0, 7, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 9, 13, 6, 2)
- Cycle 12: (10, 3, 6, 13, 10)
- Cycle 13: (11, 13, 14, 0, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 1): <1, (9, 1), 4, 8, 13>
- Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 2): <1, 4, (4, 2), 9, 1>
- Cycle 4 has a chord (6, 9): <3, (6, 9), 2, 3>
- Cycle 7 has a chord (0, 12): <7, (0, 12), 14, 0>
- Cycle 8 has a chord (7, 5): <9, 1, (7, 5), 9>
- Cycle 9 has a chord (13, 11): <9, (13, 11), 6, 13>
- Cycle 11 has a chord (9, 6): <2, 4, (9, 6), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (9, 1), 4, 8, 13>
- <1, 4, (4, 2), 9, 1>
- <3, (6, 9), 2, 3>
- <7, (0, 12), 14, 0>
- <9, 1, (7, 5), 9>
- <9, (13, 11), 6, 13>
