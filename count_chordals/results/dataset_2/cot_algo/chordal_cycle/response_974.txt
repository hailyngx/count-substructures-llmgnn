Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 4) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 14) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 14) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 14) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 4) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-2-0-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-14-10-6
- Cycle 3: 6-9-4-13-6
- Cycle 4: 6-8-7-2-6
- Cycle 5: 6-8-3-4-6
- Cycle 6: 9-4-3-5-9
- Cycle 7: 9-4-0-10-9
- Cycle 8: 9-4-13-5-9
- Cycle 9: 9-14-12-5-9
- Cycle 10: 10-0-2-1-10
- Cycle 11: 11-1-2-7-11
- Cycle 12: 11-1-5-13-11
- Cycle 13: 5-13-4-14-5
- Cycle 14: 8-3-12-5-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 5: 6-8-3-4-6 has exactly one chord (8, 4) connecting non-adjacent nodes 8 and 4.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 8, (3, 4), 6>
