Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2: 
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3: 
- The final count of chordal 4-cycles is [0].
