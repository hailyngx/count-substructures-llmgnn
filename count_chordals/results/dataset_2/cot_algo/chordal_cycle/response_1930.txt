Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 24) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 25) (9, 15) (9, 10) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 29) (14, 25) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 15) (3, 25) (3, 24) (25, 9) (25, 14) (25, 3) (25, 22) (8, 23) (8, 20) (23, 8) (23, 29) (21, 28) (21, 18) (28, 21) (28, 26) (28, 20) (22, 25) (22, 4) (22, 16) (26, 28) (11, 13) (11, 29) (11, 15) (20, 17) (20, 8) (20, 28) (10, 9) (10, 19) (4, 22) (4, 6) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 17) (16, 22) (16, 12) (16, 19) (2, 5) (2, 24) (24, 5) (24, 3) (24, 2) (24, 1) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 15) (7, 27) (15, 9) (15, 17) (15, 11) (15, 7) (15, 6) (18, 21) (18, 27) (18, 29) (18, 13) (27, 7) (27, 18) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 15) (1, 12) (1, 24) (1, 0) (1, 13) (19, 14) (19, 10) (19, 16) (29, 14) (29, 23) (29, 11) (29, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 25, 14, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 0, 6, 4, 22, 25, 14, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 25, 22, 16, 17, 15, 11, 29, 23, 8, 20, 17, 14, 25, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 15, 17, 16, 22, 25, 3, 24, 2, 5, 9)
- Cycle 5: (14, 29, 11, 15, 17, 16, 12, 1, 0, 5, 14)
- Cycle 6: (14, 25, 22, 16, 17, 20, 8, 23, 29, 14)
- Cycle 7: (17, 15, 11, 29, 18, 27, 7, 15, 17)
- Cycle 8: (25, 22, 4, 6, 0, 1, 24, 3, 25)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 14).
- Cycle 2 has a chord (0, 25).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (14, 9).
- Cycle 4 has a chord (15, 25).
- Cycle 5 has a chord (29, 15).
- Cycle 6 has a chord (23, 14).
- Cycle 7 has a chord (29, 15).
- Cycle 8 has a chord (22, 25).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (9, 14)>
- <2, (0, 25)>
- <3, (14, 9)>
- <4, (15, 25)>
- <5, (29, 15)>
- <6, (23, 14)>
- <7, (29, 15)>
- <8, (22, 25)>
