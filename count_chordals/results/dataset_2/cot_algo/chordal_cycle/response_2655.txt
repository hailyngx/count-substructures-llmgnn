Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 22) (9, 7) (26, 22) (26, 2) (26, 29) (26, 11) (3, 14) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 6) (1, 12) (10, 5) (10, 16) (11, 26) (11, 7) (11, 21) (12, 1) (12, 29) (27, 23) (27, 6) (28, 19) (28, 2) (29, 26) (29, 12) (29, 6) (0, 15) (0, 25) (14, 3) (14, 24) (14, 4) (14, 20) (22, 9) (22, 26) (22, 19) (22, 5) (22, 17) (8, 21) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 24) (7, 13) (25, 0) (25, 17) (25, 16) (19, 15) (19, 28) (19, 22) (19, 23) (17, 22) (17, 25) (17, 18) (17, 4) (2, 26) (2, 28) (2, 13) (5, 10) (5, 22) (5, 23) (23, 27) (23, 19) (23, 5) (6, 15) (6, 27) (6, 29) (6, 16) (20, 14) (20, 4) (20, 16) (21, 11) (21, 8) (21, 24) (24, 14) (24, 7) (24, 21) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 20) (4, 13) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 18) (16, 10) (16, 25) (16, 6) (16, 20) (16, 18) (18, 17) (18, 13) (18, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 14, 20, 4)
- Cycle 2: (5, 23, 27, 6)
- Cycle 3: (12, 1, 10, 5)
- Cycle 4: (17, 25, 16, 10)
- Cycle 5: (22, 19, 28, 2)
- Cycle 6: (26, 29, 12, 1)

Step 2:
Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 <3, 14, 20, 4> has a chord (14, 20).
- Cycle 2 <5, 23, 27, 6> has a chord (23, 6).
- Cycle 3 <12, 1, 10, 5> has a chord (12, 10).
- Cycle 4 <17, 25, 16, 10> has a chord (17, 16).
- Cycle 5 <22, 19, 28, 2> has two chords (19, 2) and (22, 28).
- Cycle 6 <26, 29, 12, 1> has a chord (26, 12).

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<3, 14, 20, 4> with chord (14, 20)
<5, 23, 27, 6> with chord (23, 6)
<12, 1, 10, 5> with chord (12, 10)
<17, 25, 16, 10> with chord (17, 16)
<22, 19, 28, 2> with two chords (19, 2) and (22, 28)
<26, 29, 12, 1> with chord (26, 12)
