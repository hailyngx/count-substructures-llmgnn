Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 2) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 7) (17, 3) (17, 4) (16, 10) (16, 14) (16, 15) (18, 10) (18, 19) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 2) (3, 17) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (15, 16) (15, 6) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 17) (4, 14) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 15) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 16) (14, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 13, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 19, 18, 10, 6, 15, 16, 14, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 0, 11, 2, 9, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 0, 1, 2, 9, 13, 7)
- Cycle 5: (5, 7, 14, 16, 10, 6, 8, 10, 18, 19, 4, 11, 2, 1, 0, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Chordal cycle found: Cycle 1 with chord (9, 7)
- Chordal cycle found: Cycle 2 with chord (10, 14)
- Chordal cycle found: Cycle 3 with chord (7, 13)
- Chordal cycle found: Cycle 4 with chord (7, 9)
- Chordal cycle found: Cycle 5 with chord (10, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, which are: 
<1, (9, 7), 13, 7, 5)>
<2, (10, 14), 7, 5, 19)>
<3, (7, 13), 5, 9, 2)>
<4, (7, 9), 13, 0, 1, 2)>
<5, (10, 16), 4, 19, 18, 6, 15, 16>

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [5].
