Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 17) (15, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (10, 13) (10, 16) (17, 15) (17, 12) (17, 7) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 12) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 5) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 9) (4, 13) (12, 17) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 5) (11, 14) (9, 19) (9, 18) (18, 3) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 13) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 17) (6, 2) (6, 8) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 16) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 18) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <3, 1, 7, 17, 15>
- Cycle 2: <3, 1, 5, 8, 2>
- Cycle 3: <3, 18, 16, 10, 13>
- Cycle 4: <3, 7, 17, 12, 0>
- Cycle 5: <15, 17, 12, 0, 2>
- Cycle 6: <15, 17, 7, 1, 3>
- Cycle 7: <1, 5, 8, 2, 15>
- Cycle 8: <2, 0, 14, 11, 12>
- Cycle 9: <2, 15, 17, 12, 14>
- Cycle 10: <2, 8, 19, 9, 18>
- Cycle 11: <5, 1, 3, 18, 16>
- Cycle 12: <5, 8, 19, 9, 18>
- Cycle 13: <5, 12, 17, 15, 2>
- Cycle 14: <13, 10, 16, 18, 5>
- Cycle 15: <13, 18, 16, 10, 4>
- Cycle 16: <18, 9, 19, 8, 2>
- Cycle 17: <18, 5, 1, 7, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <3, 1, 7, 17, 15> has a chord: (3, 15)
- <3, 1, 5, 8, 2> has a chord: (1, 2)
- <5, 12, 17, 15, 2> has a chord: (12, 15)
- <18, 9, 19, 8, 2> has a chord: (9, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 13 chordless cycles found.

Final answer: [13]
