Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 3) (15, 11) (15, 28) (27, 15) (27, 3) (3, 15) (3, 27) (3, 12) (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 29) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 13) (7, 5) (7, 16) (7, 1) (21, 25) (21, 17) (21, 4) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 12) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 19) (6, 9) (4, 21) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 20) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 13) (19, 23) (19, 26) (19, 24) (26, 22) (26, 19) (11, 15) (11, 28) (11, 18) (28, 15) (28, 11) (28, 0) (28, 25) (17, 21) (17, 20) (17, 16) (20, 2) (20, 17) (20, 12) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 24) (18, 11) (18, 10) (0, 28) (0, 24) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 29) (12, 3) (12, 22) (12, 8) (12, 20) (12, 29) (24, 19) (24, 1) (24, 0) (24, 10) (29, 5) (29, 16) (29, 12) (10, 18) (10, 24) (10, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 10) (25, 21) (25, 22) (25, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: (15, 27, 3, 15)
- Cycle 2: (15, 11, 28, 15)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 14, 2, 8, 12, 3, 15, 11, 18, 10, 24, 0, 28, 25, 22, 26, 19, 23, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 13, 10, 18, 11, 15, 28, 0, 24, 1, 7, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 7, 1, 24, 19, 26, 22, 25, 21, 17, 20, 12, 8, 2, 14, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 6: (21, 25, 28, 11, 18, 10, 24, 19, 26, 22)
- Cycle 7: (22, 26, 19, 24, 10, 18, 11, 15, 3, 12)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5, 9), 7>
- <2, (8, 12), 14>
- <3, (15, 27), 11>
- <5, (9, 14), 13>
- <13, (9, 14), 10>
- <16, (7, 17), 20>
- <21, (17, 25), 22>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles, thus [7].
