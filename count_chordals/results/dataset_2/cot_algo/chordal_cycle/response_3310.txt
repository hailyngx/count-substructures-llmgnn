        - Cycle 32: (9, 10, 14, 11, 9)
        - Cycle 33: (10, 3, 4, 12, 10)
        - Cycle 34: (10, 9, 6, 1, 10)
        - Cycle 35: (10, 14, 2, 7, 10)

        - Cycle 42: (13, 2, 14, 10, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (5, 8), 7, (2, 14)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (5, 9), 6, (3, 10)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (1, 14), 3, (6, 9)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (3, 10), 7, (2, 13)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (1, 14), 2, (7, 8)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (1, 14), 10, (2, 7)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (2, 13), 8, (4, 12)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (5, 1), 12, (4, 7)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (6, 1), 10, (2, 14)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, (3, 4), 14, (1, 12)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <11, (0, 7), 4, (3, 10)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <12, (4, 1), 8, (7, 2)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <13, (2, 14), 10, (3, 4)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        There are 13 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
        
Therefore, the final count of chordless cycles in the graph is [42].
