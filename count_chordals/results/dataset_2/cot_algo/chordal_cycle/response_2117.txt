Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 12) (16, 8) (16, 9) (16, 10) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 4) (9, 19) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (4, 9) (4, 17) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 1) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 18) (14, 10) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 19) (8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 17) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 0) (1, 10) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 19) (17, 5) (17, 4) (17, 8) (17, 13) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 18) (10, 16) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 7) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 10) (19, 9) (19, 2) (19, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle: (0, 1, 15, 3, 0)
- Cycle: (0, 5, 2, 8, 0)
- Cycle: (0, 10, 16, 9, 0)
- Cycle: (1, 18, 12, 5, 1)
- Cycle: (1, 0, 10, 14, 18, 1)
- Cycle: (2, 5, 12, 18, 14, 2)
- Cycle: (2, 8, 17, 4, 9, 16, 2)
- Cycle: (3, 7, 11, 9, 4, 17, 13, 3)
- Cycle: (4, 9, 16, 8, 17, 4)
- Cycle: (5, 2, 8, 16, 10, 0, 5)
- Cycle: (5, 12, 18, 14, 10, 0, 5)
- Cycle: (7, 3, 15, 1, 18, 12, 11, 7)
- Cycle: (9, 11, 7, 3, 13, 17, 8, 2, 19, 9)
- Cycle: (9, 16, 8, 2, 5, 12, 18, 1, 15, 3, 7, 11, 9)
- Cycle: (10, 0, 1, 15, 3, 13, 17, 4, 9, 16, 10)
- Cycle: (10, 1, 18, 12, 5, 2, 8, 17, 13, 3, 7, 10)
- Cycle: (14, 18, 12, 11, 7, 3, 15, 1, 0, 10, 14)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- The cycle (1, 18, 12, 5, 1) has 1 chord: (18, 5)
- The cycle (2, 5, 12, 18, 14, 2) has 1 chord: (5, 18)
- The cycle (3, 7, 11, 9, 4, 17, 13, 3) has 1 chord: (7, 9)
- The cycle (5, 2, 8, 16, 10, 0, 5) has 1 chord: (2, 16)
- The cycle (9, 11, 7, 3, 13, 17, 8, 2, 19, 9) has 1 chord: (11, 3)
- The cycle (10, 0, 1, 15, 3, 13, 17, 4, 9, 16, 10) has 1 chord: (0, 15)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [6]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (18, 5), 12, 5>
- <2, (5, 18), 12, 18>
- <3, (7, 9), 11, 9>
- <4, (2, 16), 8, 16>
- <5, (11, 3), 7, 9>
- <6, (0, 15), 1, 15>
