Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 2) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 9) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 1) (12, 4) (12, 14) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <4, 8, 2, 7>
- Cycle 2: <4, 8, 14, 12>
- Cycle 3: <7, 6, 1, 10>
- Cycle 4: <7, 6, 0, 11>
- Cycle 5: <7, 9, 0, 11>
- Cycle 6: <7, 9, 14, 8>
- Cycle 7: <7, 10, 1, 2>
- Cycle 8: <7, 10, 11, 5>
- Cycle 9: <10, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 10: <10, 11, 0, 14>
- Cycle 11: <11, 0, 3, 4>
- Cycle 12: <11, 5, 1, 6>
- Cycle 13: <11, 5, 13, 2>
- Cycle 14: <13, 5, 0, 6>
- Cycle 15: <13, 5, 1, 2>
- Cycle 16: <4, 3, 0, 11>
- Cycle 17: <8, 14, 0, 3>
- Cycle 18: <8, 14, 5, 11>
- Cycle 19: <8, 2, 1, 10>
- Cycle 20: <8, 2, 13, 5>
- Cycle 21: <12, 14, 9, 7>
- Cycle 22: <12, 4, 3, 0>
- Cycle 23: <14, 9, 0, 3>
- Cycle 24: <14, 9, 7, 10>
- Cycle 25: <9, 0, 3, 4>
- Cycle 26: <9, 2, 13, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycle found is:
<7, 9, 14, 8> with chord (8, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 25 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
