Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- Cycle 1: 1-6-7-4-1  
- Cycle 2: 4-9-8-6-4  
- Cycle 3: 5-2-4-7-5  
- Cycle 4: 0-7-4-2-0  
- Cycle 5: 1-6-8-5-1  
- Cycle 6: 1-0-7-4-1  
- Cycle 7: 2-4-9-8-2  
- Cycle 8: 3-4-7-0-3  
- Cycle 9: 3-4-2-5-3  
- Cycle 10: 3-5-8-2-3  

Step 2:  
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:  
- Cycle 1: Chord (6, 4)  
- Cycle 2: Chord (9, 6)  
- Cycle 3: Chord (2, 7)  
- Cycle 4: Chord (7, 4)  
- Cycle 5: Chord (6, 8)  
- Cycle 6: Chord (7, 1)  
- Cycle 7: Chord (4, 8)  
- Cycle 8: Chord (4, 0)  
- Cycle 9: No chord  
- Cycle 10: Chord (5, 2)  

Step 3:  
Count the number of chordless cycles:  
There is 1 chordless cycle found.  

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].  

Unique chordal 4-cycle:  
- < (3, 5), 4, (2, 7), 3 >
