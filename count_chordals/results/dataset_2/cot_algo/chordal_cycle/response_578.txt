Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 5) (16, 12) (16, 6) (16, 9) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 19) (10, 2) (4, 13) (4, 2) (18, 10) (18, 13) (17, 9) (17, 19) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 19) (7, 2) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 15) (19, 10) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 14) (14, 19) (14, 6) (12, 16) (12, 15) (12, 9) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 12) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 15) (6, 16) (6, 14) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 8) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 13 - 4 - 2 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 1 - 13 - 18 - 10 - 3 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 1 - 13 - 18 - 10 - 2 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 4: 11 - 10 - 18 - 13 - 1 - 0 - 11
- Cycle 5: 11 - 10 - 3 - 7 - 19 - 17 - 9 - 16 - 12 - 15 - 8 - 5 - 11
- Cycle 6: 15 - 8 - 0 - 1 - 13 - 18 - 10 - 19 - 17 - 9 - 12 - 16 - 6 - 14 - 15

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 4).
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (13, 10).
- Cycles 4 and 6 have no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There are 2 chordless cycles which are <11, 10, 3, 7> and <16, 6, 15, 12>.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
