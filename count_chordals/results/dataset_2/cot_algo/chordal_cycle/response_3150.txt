Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 14) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 7-4-2-9-7
- Cycle 2: 6-5-14-12-6
- Cycle 3: 6-5-9-2-6
- Cycle 4: 13-10-4-14-13
- Cycle 5: 13-10-14-12-13

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (5, 12)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (10, 14)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (10, 12)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<7, (4, 9), 2, 9> 
<6, (5, 12), 14, 12>
<6, (5, 9), 2, 6> 
<13, (10, 14), 4, 14>
<13, (10, 12), 14, 12>
