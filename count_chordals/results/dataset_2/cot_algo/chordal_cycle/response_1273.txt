Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 6) (8, 14) (8, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (12, 5) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 3) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 6) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 2) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 0) (6, 13) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 7, 12, 4)
- Cycle 2: (0, 7, 5, 11, 1, 0)
- Cycle 3: (2, 7, 5, 11, 1, 2)
- Cycle 4: (0, 7, 12, 3, 2, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 7, 12, 5, 11, 1, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 7, 2, 3, 12, 0)
- Cycle 7: (13, 0, 7, 5, 11, 1, 13)
- Cycle 8: (13, 0, 7, 12, 5, 11, 1, 13)
- Cycle 9: (0, 7, 12, 2, 1, 13, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (edges 7 and 12 form a chord) and is chordal. <1, (7, 12), 4>
- Cycle 2 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 3 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord (edges 7 and 12 form a chord) and is chordal. <4, (7, 12), 3>
- Cycle 5 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 6 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 7 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 8 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 9 does not have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found, which is 2.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [2].
