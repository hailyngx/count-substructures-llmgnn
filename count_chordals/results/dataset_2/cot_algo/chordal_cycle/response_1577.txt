24. (6, 0, 15, 11, 6)
25. (17, 19, 7, 2, 17)
26. (17, 6, 0, 15, 17)
27. (17, 5, 4, 18, 17)
28. (14, 16, 1, 5, 14)
29. (14, 3, 18, 4, 14)
30. (14, 8, 12, 9, 14)
31. (14, 7, 3, 14)
32. (2, 11, 15, 0, 2)
33. (2, 9, 12, 8, 2)
34. (2, 7, 3, 14, 2)
35. (0, 15, 11, 16, 0)
36. (0, 6, 17, 5, 0)
37. (1, 16, 14, 3, 1)
38. (1, 5, 17, 19, 1)
39. (1, 10, 13, 10, 1)
40. (10, 1, 16, 11, 10)
41. (10, 13, 10, 1, 10)
42. (5, 11, 15, 0, 5)
43. (5, 4, 18, 11, 5)
44. (5, 17, 6, 0, 5)
45. (5, 1, 16, 14, 5)
46. (13, 10, 1, 16, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle: 
<1, (16, 11), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 45 chordless 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
