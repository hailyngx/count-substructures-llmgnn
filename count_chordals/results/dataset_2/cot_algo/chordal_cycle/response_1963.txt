Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - <1, (6, 17), 2>
        - <2, (12, 17), 4>
        - <3, (4, 16), 10>
        - <4, (3, 10), 16>
        - <5, (7, 0), 11>
        - <6, (1, 10), 9>
        - <7, (13, 15), 6>
        - <8, (5, 7), 8>
        - <9, (1, 0), 13>
        - <10, (4, 16), 3>
        - <11, (8, 10), 5>
        - <12, (7, 0), 1>
        - <13, (15, 17), 9>
        - <14, (9, 6), 15>
        - <15, (12, 2), 17>
        - <16, (9, 15), 18>
        - <17, (6, 9), 15>
        - <18, (16, 18), 4>
        - <19, (9, 19), 11>
        - <20, (2, 6), 17>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        As there are 20 chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [20].
