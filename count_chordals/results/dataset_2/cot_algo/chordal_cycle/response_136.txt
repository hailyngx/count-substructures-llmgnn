Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 29) (9, 14) (9, 12) (26, 23) (26, 15) (26, 8) (0, 10) (0, 3) (27, 24) (27, 13) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 23) (20, 5) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 23) (25, 22) (10, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 23) (11, 1) (5, 20) (5, 6) (5, 4) (6, 10) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 17) (21, 6) (21, 8) (28, 11) (28, 22) (28, 7) (16, 1) (29, 9) (29, 7) (19, 22) (19, 4) (19, 13) (23, 26) (23, 20) (23, 25) (23, 11) (23, 18) (2, 17) (22, 25) (22, 28) (22, 19) (24, 27) (24, 17) (24, 4) (3, 0) (3, 17) (7, 28) (7, 29) (1, 11) (1, 16) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 24) (17, 3) (17, 8) (15, 26) (18, 20) (18, 23) (18, 8) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 24) (13, 27) (13, 25) (13, 10) (13, 19) (13, 14) (8, 26) (8, 10) (8, 21) (8, 17) (8, 18) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 12) (12, 9) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<1, 11, 28, 7>
<1, 11, 23, 25>
<1, 16, 24, 4>
<11, 1, 16, 24>
<11, 28, 22, 25>
<11, 23, 20, 25>
<11, 23, 18, 20>
<16, 1, 11, 28>
<16, 1, 11, 23>
<16, 1, 11, 23, 25>
<16, 24, 4, 5>
<23, 11, 28, 22>
<23, 11, 28, 7>
<23, 11, 1, 16>
<23, 11, 16, 24>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

<1, 11, 28, 7> - Chord: (11, 28)
<1, 11, 23, 25> - Chord: (11, 23)
<1, 16, 24, 4> - Chord: (16, 24)
<11, 28, 22, 25> - Chord: (28, 22)
<11, 23, 18, 20> - Chord: (23, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

So the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
