Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 24) (16, 23) (16, 4) (5, 13) (5, 22) (5, 15) (5, 10) (9, 29) (9, 15) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 6) (3, 1) (0, 12) (0, 23) (20, 7) (20, 12) (20, 18) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 22) (4, 25) (18, 20) (18, 4) (18, 12) (18, 28) (19, 26) (19, 8) (19, 27) (26, 19) (26, 24) (21, 24) (21, 6) (21, 25) (24, 16) (24, 26) (24, 21) (24, 29) (24, 25) (28, 18) (28, 14) (17, 1) (17, 2) (17, 7) (6, 1) (6, 21) (6, 2) (6, 27) (29, 9) (29, 24) (29, 15) (8, 11) (8, 19) (8, 22) (13, 5) (13, 23) (14, 9) (14, 28) (22, 5) (22, 4) (22, 8) (22, 27) (27, 19) (27, 6) (27, 22) (23, 16) (23, 0) (23, 13) (23, 7) (7, 20) (7, 17) (7, 23) (12, 0) (12, 20) (12, 18) (25, 4) (25, 21) (25, 24) (25, 15) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 29) (15, 25) (10, 5) (2, 17) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (16, 24, 21, 6) 
- Cycle 2: (16, 24, 29, 15) 
- Cycle 3: (16, 23, 7, 20)
- Cycle 4: (16, 23, 0, 12) 
- Cycle 5: (16, 4, 22, 8) 
- Cycle 6: (16, 4, 25, 21)
- Cycle 7: (5, 10, 5, 13) 
- Cycle 8: (9, 15, 29, 9) 
- Cycle 9: (9, 15, 5, 10) 
- Cycle 10: (9, 15, 5, 22) 
- Cycle 11: (9, 14, 28, 18) 
- Cycle 12: (1, 3, 1, 6) 
- Cycle 13: (1, 3, 1, 17) 
- Cycle 14: (3, 1, 6, 21) 
- Cycle 15: (0, 12, 18, 20) 
- Cycle 16: (0, 12, 23, 7) 
- Cycle 17: (20, 7, 23, 0) 
- Cycle 18: (20, 12, 18, 28) 
- Cycle 19: (4, 16, 24, 26) 
- Cycle 20: (4, 16, 23, 13) 
- Cycle 21: (4, 22, 27, 19) 
- Cycle 22: (4, 18, 28, 14) 
- Cycle 23: (18, 20, 7, 17) 
- Cycle 24: (18, 28, 14, 9) 
- Cycle 25: (19, 26, 24, 16) 
- Cycle 26: (19, 27, 22, 8) 
- Cycle 27: (26, 24, 29, 15) 
- Cycle 28: (26, 24, 16, 4) 
- Cycle 29: (21, 24, 29, 15) 
- Cycle 30: (21, 6, 2, 17) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (3, 6), 17>
- <4, (16, 24), 26>
- <4, (16, 23), 13>
- <4, (22, 27), 19>
- <16, (24, 29), 15>
- <9, (15, 29), 9>
- <18, (20, 7), 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 23 chordless 4-cycles, so the final count is [23].
