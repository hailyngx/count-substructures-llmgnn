Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (4, 7, 3, 1, 4)
2. (4, 7, 9, 6, 4)
3. (4, 8, 9, 7, 4)
4. (4, 5, 1, 6, 4)
5. (7, 3, 1, 5, 7)
6. (7, 9, 6, 5, 7)
7. (1, 3, 6, 9, 1)
8. (3, 6, 9, 8, 3)
9. (6, 1, 5, 0, 6)
10. (9, 7, 0, 5, 9)
11. (8, 4, 5, 0, 8)
12. (5, 1, 6, 9, 5)
13. (0, 7, 9, 8, 0)
14. (2, 3, 1, 5, 2)
15. (2, 9, 6, 3, 2)
16. (2, 8, 9, 7, 2)

Step 2:
- The cycles with exactly one chord (forming chordal 4-cycles) are:
<1, (3, 5), 4>
<2, (1, 5), 9>
<3, (1, 5), 6>
<4, (4, 7), 8>
<5, (1, 6), 3>
<6, (6, 9), 7>
<7, (0, 5), 8>
<8, (1, 6), 5>
<9, (7, 9), 6>
<10, (0, 8), 4>
<11, (1, 6), 9>
<12, (0, 8), 9>
<13, (1, 5), 2>

Step 3:
- Count of chordal 4-cycles: [13]
