Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 8) (16, 10) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 12) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 19) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 18) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 8) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 15) (1, 12) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 12) (8, 16) (8, 18) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 15) (12, 13) (3, 5) (3, 0) (4, 19) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 7) (10, 16) (7, 14) (7, 19) (7, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists: 
1. (11, 16, 15, 1, 5, 9, 11)
2. (11, 16, 15, 12, 1, 5, 9, 11)
3. (11, 16, 10, 8, 18, 17, 6, 5, 9, 11)
4. (11, 15, 12, 9, 5, 1, 15)
5. (11, 15, 1, 12, 9, 5, 11)
6. (11, 15, 1, 5, 9, 14, 19, 7, 13, 11)
7. (11, 15, 1, 5, 9, 14, 19, 4, 13, 11)
8. (11, 13, 12, 15, 1, 5, 3, 0, 17, 18, 8, 16, 11)
9. (11, 13, 7, 19, 14, 9, 5, 1, 15, 12, 13)
10. (11, 13, 7, 19, 14, 9, 12, 15, 1, 5, 13)
11. (16, 15, 1, 5, 9, 14, 19, 4, 13, 6, 17, 18, 8, 10, 16)
12. (16, 15, 1, 12, 9, 14, 19, 7, 13, 6, 17, 18, 8, 10, 16)
13. (5, 9, 14, 19, 7, 13, 12, 1, 15, 11, 16, 8, 10, 16, 15)
14. (5, 9, 14, 19, 7, 13, 12, 15, 1, 5, 6, 17, 18, 8, 16, 11)
15. (9, 14, 19, 7, 13, 12, 15, 1, 5, 6, 17, 18, 8, 16, 11, 9)
16. (14, 19, 7, 13, 12, 1, 5, 6, 17, 18, 8, 16, 10, 15, 11, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord: 
- <11, 16, 15, 1, 5, 9, 11>  (Chord: (9, 5))
- <11, 15, 12, 9, 5, 1, 15>  (Chord: (12, 1))
- <11, 13, 12, 15, 1, 5, 3, 0, 17, 18, 8, 16, 11>  (Chord: (15, 3))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in this graph, so the final count is [0].
