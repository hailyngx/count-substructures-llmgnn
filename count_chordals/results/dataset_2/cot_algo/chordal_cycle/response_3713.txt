Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 6) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 11) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1:  
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-1-12-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-14-11-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-9-10-0
- Cycle 4: 0-5-11-12-0
- Cycle 5: 0-10-12-11-0
- Cycle 6: 1-4-14-11-1
- Cycle 7: 1-10-12-11-1
- Cycle 8: 1-10-0-2-1
- Cycle 9: 2-0-10-12-2
- Cycle 10: 2-1-10-0-2
- Cycle 11: 3-8-13-7-3
- Cycle 12: 3-6-11-14-3
- Cycle 13: 3-10-0-2-3
- Cycle 14: 4-14-11-12-4

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, (4, 1), 12, 0>
- <0, (4, 14), 11, 0>
- <0, (5, 9), 10, 0>
- <0, (5, 11), 12, 0>
- <0, (10, 12), 11, 0>
- <1, (4, 14), 11, 1>
- <1, (10, 12), 11, 1>
- <1, (0, 2), 10, 1>
- <2, (0, 10), 12, 2>
- <2, (1, 10), 0, 2>
- <3, (8, 13), 7, 3>
- <3, (6, 11), 14, 3>
- <3, (0, 2), 10, 3>
- <4, (14, 11), 12, 4>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have [14].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph are:
<0, (4, 1), 12, 0>
<0, (4, 14), 11, 0>
<0, (5, 9), 10, 0>
<0, (5, 11), 12, 0>
<0, (10, 12), 11, 0>
<1, (4, 14), 11, 1>
<1, (10, 12), 11, 1>
<1, (0, 2), 10, 1>
<2, (0, 10), 12, 2>
<2, (1, 10), 0, 2>
<3, (8, 13), 7, 3>
<3, (6, 11), 14, 3>
<3, (0, 2), 10, 3>
<4, (14, 11), 12, 4>
