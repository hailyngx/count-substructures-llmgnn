Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 13) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 9) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 10) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 4) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 10) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 10) (12, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph, here are some examples:
- Cycle 1: nodes 1-8-2-5-1
- Cycle 2: nodes 1-8-6-12-1
- Cycle 3: nodes 1-11-2-5-1
- Cycle 4: nodes 3-4-13-5-3
- Cycle 5: nodes 0-3-13-7-0
- Cycle 6: nodes 0-9-8-6-0
- Cycle 7: nodes 2-14-0-9-2
- Cycle 8: nodes 7-6-12-5-7
- Cycle 9: nodes 4-3-11-2-4

Step 2:
Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <1, 5>
- Cycle 4 has a chord: <3, 13>
- Cycle 5 has a chord: <0, 13>
- Cycle 6 has a chord: <0, 8>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <2, 9>
- Cycle 8 has a chord: <5, 12>
- Cycle 9 has a chord: <11, 2>

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which have exactly one chord:
- [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 5, 8, 2>
- <3, 13, 4, 5>
- <0, 13, 3, 7>
- <0, 8, 9, 6>
- <11, 2, 4, 3>
