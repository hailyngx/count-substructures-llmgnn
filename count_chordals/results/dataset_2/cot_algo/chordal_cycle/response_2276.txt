Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
1. (9, 5, 9, 2)
2. (9, 5, 9, 3)
3. (9, 5, 9, 1)
4. (9, 5, 9, 7)
5. (5, 9, 5, 9)
6. (5, 9, 6, 9)
7. (5, 9, 3, 9)
8. (5, 9, 7, 9)
9. (9, 6, 9, 2)
10. (9, 6, 9, 3)
11. (9, 6, 9, 1)
12. (9, 6, 9, 7)
13. (6, 9, 6, 7)
14. (6, 9, 6, 8)
15. (6, 9, 6, 0)
16. (9, 1, 9, 7)
17. (1, 9, 1, 4)
18. (1, 9, 1, 8)
19. (1, 9, 1, 0)
20. (9, 7, 9, 4)
21. (9, 7, 9, 6)
22. (7, 9, 7, 4)
23. (7, 9, 7, 6)
24. (7, 9, 7, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <9, (5, 2), 9> 
2. <9, (5, 3), 9> 
3. <9, (5, 1), 9> 
4. <9, (5, 7), 9>
5. <6, (9, 8), 6> 
6. <1, (9, 4), 1>
7. <1, (9, 8), 1> 
8. <1, (9, 0), 1>
9. <7, (9, 4), 7> 
10. <7, (9, 6), 7>
11. <7, (9, 6), 7> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles. So, the final answer is [11].
