Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 13) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <1, 5, 11, 7>
2. Cycle <1, 5, 9, 10>
3. Cycle <1, 5, 9, 13>
4. Cycle <1, 5, 9, 14>
5. Cycle <1, 7, 11, 10>
6. Cycle <1, 7, 11, 0>
7. Cycle <1, 7, 12, 6>
8. Cycle <1, 7, 12, 14>
9. Cycle <1, 7, 2, 3>
10. Cycle <1, 7, 2, 7>
11. Cycle <1, 7, 4, 6>
12. Cycle <1, 7, 4, 12>
13. Cycle <1, 7, 4, 6, 12>
14. Cycle <1, 7, 4, 12, 8>
15. Cycle <1, 7, 4, 6, 13>
16. Cycle <1, 7, 4, 12, 14>
17. Cycle <1, 3, 2, 7>
18. Cycle <1, 3, 13, 6>

Step 2:
After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the unique chordal 4-cycle:

<1, 5, 9, 13>

Step 3:
The total number of chordless cycles found is [1].
