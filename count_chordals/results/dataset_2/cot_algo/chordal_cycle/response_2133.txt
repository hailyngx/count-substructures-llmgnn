Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-8-7-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-5-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-5-7-0
- Cycle 4: 0-7-5-2-0
- Cycle 5: 2-5-1-0-2
- Cycle 6: 2-5-3-4-2
- Cycle 7: 2-5-7-6-2
- Cycle 8: 2-6-7-9-2
- Cycle 9: 4-3-5-2-4
- Cycle 10: 4-6-7-5-4
- Cycle 11: 7-5-1-0-7
- Cycle 12: 7-5-2-6-7
- Cycle 13: 7-8-2-5-7

Step 2: Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 2: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 3: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 4: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 5: <2, (1, 8)>
- Cycle 6: <2, (3, 5)>
- Cycle 7: <2, (7, 6)>
- Cycle 8: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 9: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 10: <4, (6, 5)>
- Cycle 11: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 12: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 13: <7, (8, 5)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
- There are 7 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Final answer: [7]
