Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 1) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 12) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 14) (5, 8) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (3, 7) (3, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 9) (1, 13) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14) (13, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- (0, 4, 8, 12)
- (0, 4, 6, 3)
- (0, 4, 8, 11)
- (0, 4, 8, 2)
- (0, 9, 11, 13)
- (0, 9, 14, 13)
- (0, 9, 1, 13)
- (2, 8, 5, 0)
- (2, 8, 4, 0)
- (2, 8, 11, 13)
- (2, 8, 4, 6)
- (2, 8, 5, 0)
- (2, 9, 7, 3)
- (2, 9, 0, 6)
- (2, 9, 14, 13)
- (2, 9, 11, 13)
- (2, 9, 1, 13)
- (2, 7, 10, 1)
- (3, 7, 10, 1)
- (3, 7, 9, 0)
- (3, 6, 4, 8)
- (5, 8, 4, 0)
- (5, 0, 6, 4)
- (7, 10, 1, 13)
- (7, 10, 1, 9)
- (7, 12, 8, 4)
- (7, 12, 8, 11)
- (7, 12, 14, 9)

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 8, 12>, chord: (8, 12)
- <0, 4, 6, 3>, chord: (4, 6)
- <0, 4, 8, 11>, chord: (4, 11)
- <0, 4, 8, 2>, chord: (4, 8)
- <2, 8, 11, 13>, chord: (8, 13)
- <2, 9, 7, 3>, chord: (7, 3)
- <5, 8, 4, 0>, chord: (8, 4)
- <7, 10, 1, 13>, chord: (10, 1)
- <7, 12, 14, 9>, chord: (12, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [9].
