Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 2) with edges (5, 9), (9, 6), (6, 2), (2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 6, 3) with edges (4, 7), (7, 6), (6, 3), (3, 4)
- Cycle 3: (1, 4, 3, 6) with edges (1, 4), (4, 3), (3, 6), (6, 1)
- Cycle 4: (8, 5, 7, 4) with edges (8, 5), (5, 7), (7, 4), (4, 8)
- Cycle 5: (2, 9, 5, 7) with edges (2, 9), (9, 5), (5, 7), (7, 2)
- Cycle 6: (0, 4, 3, 1) with edges (0, 4), (4, 3), (3, 1), (1, 0)
- Cycle 7: (8, 0, 1, 4) with edges (8, 0), (0, 1), (1, 4), (4, 8)
- Cycle 8: (8, 2, 1, 3) with edges (8, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (3, 8)
- Cycle 9: (5, 8, 2, 9) with edges (5, 8), (8, 2), (2, 9), (9, 5)
- Cycle 10: (6, 3, 0, 8) with edges (6, 3), (3, 0), (0, 8), (8, 6)
- Cycle 11: (7, 6, 2, 8) with edges (7, 6), (6, 2), (2, 8), (8, 7)
- Cycle 12: (5, 8, 0, 4) with edges (5, 8), (8, 0), (0, 4), (4, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Among the cycles, only Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (5, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There is only one unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph, thus the final number is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <5, (5, 2), 9>
