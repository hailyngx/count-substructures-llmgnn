Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 7) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 19) (17, 1) (17, 9) (17, 11) (0, 18) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 18) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 14) (9, 8) (9, 17) (5, 13) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (12, 4) (12, 8) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 14) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 11) (19, 16) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 19) (11, 6) (14, 1) (14, 15) (14, 3) (14, 16) (6, 7) (6, 11) (10, 8) (16, 19) (16, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-8-9-17-1-14-3-7-18-15-19-16-14-1-17-9-8-4-0
- Cycle 2: 3-7-18-15-19-16-14-3
- Cycle 3: 4-8-9-17-1-14-16-19
- Cycle 4: 7-8-4-12-8-10-7
- Cycle 5: 3-7-0-4-12-8-9-17-11-13-3

Step 2: Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 9) - <1, (1, 9), 14>
- Cycle 3 has a chord (8, 16) - <3, (8, 16), 19>
- Cycle 4 has a chord (4, 12) - <4, (4, 12), 8>
- Cycle 5 has a chord (7, 13) - <5, (7, 13), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
