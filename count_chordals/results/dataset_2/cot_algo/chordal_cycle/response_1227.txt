Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 9) (3, 15) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 8) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 7) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 6) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 9) (5, 15) (5, 19) (19, 17) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 6) (2, 17) (2, 12) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 18) (0, 15) (0, 13) (0, 10) (6, 8) (6, 19) (18, 11) (18, 12) (9, 16) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 11-16-13-8-11
- Cycle 2: 11-16-9-14-15-11
- Cycle 3: 3-15-14-17-2-3
- Cycle 4: 4-11-16-13-4
- Cycle 5: 4-3-15-14-4
- Cycle 6: 4-7-10-9-4
- Cycle 7: 7-10-0-13-8-7
- Cycle 8: 7-8-17-19-5-7
- Cycle 9: 14-15-5-19-6-14
- Cycle 10: 17-14-9-10-7-17
- Cycle 11: 17-8-13-12-2-17
- Cycle 12: 8-13-0-10-9-8
- Cycle 13: 13-16-11-18-12-13
- Cycle 14: 10-0-13-12-18-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 16, (13, 8), 11>
- <2, 16, (9, 14), 11>
- <3, 15, (14, 17), 2>
- <4, 11, (16, 13), 4>
- <5, 15, (14, 4), 3>
- <6, 7, (10, 9), 4>
- <7, 8, (17, 19), 7>
- <8, 17, (14, 5), 15>
- <9, 14, (5, 19), 15>
- <10, 14, (9, 10), 17>
- <11, 8, (13, 12), 17>
- <12, 13, (0, 10), 8>
- <13, 16, (11, 18), 13>
- <14, 10, (13, 12), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [14]
