- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 7, 17)
- Cycle 3: (5, 13, 2, 16)
- Cycle 4: (5, 15, 2, 16)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 14, 0)
- Cycle 6: (5, 10, 18, 6)
- Cycle 7: (12, 9, 14, 0)
- Cycle 8: (12, 13, 3, 2)
- Cycle 9: (16, 12, 9, 14)
- Cycle 10: (16, 2, 7, 17)
- Cycle 11: (16, 6, 18, 19)
- Cycle 12: (17, 7, 2, 13)
- Cycle 13: (17, 15, 5, 13)
- Cycle 14: (17, 18, 10, 5)

- Cycle 16: (18, 10, 5, 9)
- Cycle 17: (18, 6, 16, 12)
- Cycle 18: (18, 19, 0, 14)
- Cycle 19: (19, 11, 8, 15)
- Cycle 20: (19, 6, 18, 17)

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles by checking for exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycle 1: <5, (9, 14), 0, 12, 16>
- Chordal cycle 2: <5, (4, 7), 17, 2, 16>
- Chordal cycle 3: <5, (13, 2), 16, 15, 7>
- Chordal cycle 4: <5, (15, 2), 16, 6, 18>
- Chordal cycle 5: <5, (10, 18), 6, 16, 12>
- Chordal cycle 6: <9, (12, 16), 6, 18, 14>
- Chordal cycle 7: <12, (13, 3), 2, 16, 6>
- Chordal cycle 8: <16, (2, 7), 17, 18, 6>
- Chordal cycle 9: <17, (15, 5), 13, 2, 7>
- Chordal cycle 10: <18, (10, 5), 9, 12, 16>
- Chordal cycle 11: <18, (6, 16), 12, 9, 14>
- Chordal cycle 12: <18, (19, 0), 14, 9, 10>
- Chordal cycle 13: <19, (11, 8), 15, 5, 13>
- Chordal cycle 14: <19, (6, 18), 17, 7, 2>

Step 3:
Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found, [14].
