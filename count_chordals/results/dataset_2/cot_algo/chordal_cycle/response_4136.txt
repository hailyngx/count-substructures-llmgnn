Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (8, 13) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 6) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 12) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 7) (12, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 0, 5, 9, 1)
- (1, 0, 10, 11, 1)
- (1, 0, 11, 13, 1)
- (1, 0, 14, 6, 1)
- (1, 3, 2, 6, 1)
- (1, 3, 2, 9, 1)
- (1, 6, 4, 14, 1)
- (1, 6, 13, 5, 1)
- (1, 11, 0, 10, 1)
- (1, 11, 2, 3, 1)
- (1, 11, 13, 6, 1)
- (1, 11, 13, 5, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <1, (0, 10), 11, 13, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless cycles is [11].
