Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 19) (16, 6) (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 2) (14, 17) (14, 0) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 2) (17, 18) (1, 3) (1, 18) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 12) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 15) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 17) (18, 1) (18, 2) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 15) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 2) (4, 14) (4, 6) (15, 11) (15, 13) (15, 12) (19, 16) (19, 6) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
1. Cycle: 11 - 16 - 19 - 6 - 11
2. Cycle: 5 - 9 - 2 - 5
3. Cycle: 14 - 17 - 18 - 1 - 14
4. Cycle: 3 - 8 - 6 - 4 - 3

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. Cycle <11, 16, 19, 6>: (11, 19) is a chord.
2. Cycle <5, 9, 2, 5>: (5, 2) is a chord.
3. Cycle <14, 17, 18, 1>: (14, 18) is a chord.
4. Cycle <3, 8, 6, 4>: (3, 6) is a chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chorded 4-cycles: [4]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<11, 16, 19, 6, (11, 19)>
<5, 9, 2, 5, (5, 2)>
<14, 17, 18, 1, (14, 18)>
<3, 8, 6, 4, (3, 6)>
