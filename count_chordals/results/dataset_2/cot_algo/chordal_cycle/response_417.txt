This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (1, 4) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 4) (17, 7) (4, 1) (4, 17) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 15) (8, 17) (8, 4) (2, 16) (18, 7) (18, 12) (0, 19) (0, 13) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (14, 19) (14, 13) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 18) (7, 9) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 14) (5, 15) (5, 11) (5, 12) (9, 10) (9, 7) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 5) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 4) (6, 11) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- List of cycles of length 4 or more:
   - Cycle 1: (3, 7, 17, 10)
   - Cycle 2: (3, 7, 18, 12)
   - Cycle 3: (3, 16, 2, 10)
   - Cycle 4: (15, 19, 0, 13)
   - Cycle 5: (15, 19, 14, 13)
   - Cycle 6: (15, 8, 4, 17)
   - Cycle 7: (15, 8, 17, 7)
   - Cycle 8: (15, 5, 12, 11)
   - Cycle 9: (1, 4, 8, 17)
   - Cycle 10: (10, 17, 7, 18)
   - Cycle 11: (10, 6, 4, 8)
   - Cycle 12: (16, 3, 7, 17)
   - Cycle 13: (16, 2, 10, 6)
   - Cycle 14: (11, 5, 15, 19)
   - Cycle 15: (11, 6, 10, 17)
   - Cycle 16: (12, 17, 7, 3)
   - Cycle 17: (12, 18, 7, 17)
   - Cycle 18: (6, 3, 7, 17)
   - Cycle 19: (6, 4, 8, 15)
   - Cycle 20: (13, 15, 8, 4)

Step 2:
- Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
   - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, (7, 17), 10>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, (7, 18), 12>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <15, (19, 0), 13>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <15, (8, 4), 17>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <15, (8, 17), 7>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <15, (5, 12), 11>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, (4, 8), 17>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <10, (17, 7), 18>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <10, (6, 4), 8>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <16, (3, 7), 17>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <16, (2, 10), 6>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <11, (5, 15), 19>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <11, (6, 10), 17>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 14: <12, (17, 7), 3>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 15: <12, (18, 7), 17>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 16: <6, (3, 7), 17>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 17: <6, (4, 8), 15>
   - Chordal 4-cycle 18: <13, (15, 8), 4>

Step 3:
- Count of chordal 4-cycles: [18]
