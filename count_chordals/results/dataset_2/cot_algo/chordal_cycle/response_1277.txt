The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 12) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 22) (16, 15) (1, 20) (1, 27) (21, 19) (21, 22) (21, 15) (6, 22) (6, 18) (9, 5) (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 29) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 18) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 20) (17, 4) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 23) (27, 1) (27, 2) (27, 3) (4, 8) (4, 17) (4, 20) (15, 11) (15, 16) (15, 21) (15, 20) (15, 28) (20, 1) (20, 17) (20, 4) (20, 15) (20, 26) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 27) (3, 25) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 29) (7, 2) (19, 11) (19, 21) (19, 23) (19, 18) (19, 24) (23, 0) (23, 25) (23, 19) (26, 20) (26, 29) (18, 6) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 29) (2, 13) (2, 27) (2, 7) (12, 11) (12, 10) (12, 24) (28, 15) (29, 5) (29, 25) (29, 26) (29, 18) (10, 12) (10, 22) (24, 19) (24, 12) (22, 16) (22, 21) (22, 6) (22, 10)

        - Cycle 8: (11, 16, 15, 20, 1, 27, 2)
        - Cycle 9: (11, 16, 15, 20, 4, 8, 13)
        - Cycle 10: (11, 15, 21, 22, 6, 18, 19)
        - Cycle 11: (11, 15, 20, 4, 17, 14, 3)
        - Cycle 12: (11, 15, 20, 1, 27, 2, 7)

        - Cycle 14: (11, 12, 24, 19, 18, 6, 22)
        - Cycle 15: (11, 12, 24, 19, 23, 0, 16)
        - Cycle 16: (11, 19, 21, 22, 6, 18, 13)
        - Cycle 17: (11, 19, 18, 6, 22, 16, 15)
        - Cycle 18: (11, 19, 23, 0, 3, 27, 1)
        - Cycle 19: (11, 19, 23, 0, 16, 15, 21)
        - Cycle 20: (11, 19, 24, 12, 10, 22, 21)
        - Cycle 21: (11, 19, 24, 12, 10, 22, 16)
        - Cycle 22: (11, 19, 24, 12, 10, 22, 6)
        - Cycle 23: (16, 15, 20, 1, 27, 2, 13)
        - Cycle 24: (16, 15, 20, 26, 29, 18, 6)
        - Cycle 25: (16, 15, 20, 4, 17, 14, 3)
        - Cycle 26: (16, 0, 3, 27, 2, 7, 2)
        - Cycle 27: (16, 0, 23, 19, 18, 6, 22)
        - Cycle 28: (16, 0, 23, 19, 18, 29, 25)
        - Cycle 29: (16, 0, 23, 19, 24, 12, 10)
        - Cycle 30: (16, 0, 23, 25, 29, 18, 6)
        - Cycle 31: (16, 0, 23, 25, 3, 14, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        - <Cycle 1, (11, 1)> with chord (11, 1)
        - <Cycle 3, (15, 19)> with chord (15, 19)
        - <Cycle 5, (0, 4)> with chord (0, 4)
        - <Cycle 6, (4, 14)> with chord (4, 14)
        - <Cycle 7, (3, 13)> with chord (3, 13)
        - <Cycle 10, (22, 18)> with chord (22, 18)
        - <Cycle 11, (17, 20)> with chord (17, 20)
        - <Cycle 13, (11, 24)> with chord (11, 24)
        - <Cycle 14, (12, 22)> with chord (12, 22)
        - <Cycle 18, (23, 1)> with chord (23, 1)
        - <Cycle 19, (0, 21)> with chord (0, 21)
        - <Cycle 20, (19, 22)> with chord (19, 22)
        - <Cycle 23, (20, 13)> with chord (20, 13)
        - <Cycle 24, (20, 18)> with chord (20, 18)
        - <Cycle 25, (15, 17)> with chord (15, 17)
        - <Cycle 26, (0, 27)> with chord (0, 27)
        - <Cycle 27, (0, 22)> with chord (0, 22)
        - <Cycle 28, (23, 18)> with chord (23, 18)
        - <Cycle 29, (23, 10)> with chord (23, 10)
        - <Cycle 30, (0, 29)> with chord (0, 29)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        - There are 11 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

        Therefore, the final answer is [11].
