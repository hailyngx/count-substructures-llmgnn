Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2)

- Cycle <1, 8, 4, 5, 4, 0, 2, 7, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 5, 4, 1> (Chord: (9, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 5, 2, 4, 1> (Chords: (9, 2) and (5, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 5, 4, 8, 1> (Chords: (9, 8) and (5, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 5, 4, 0, 3, 1> (Chords: (9, 0) and (5, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 5, 4, 2, 0, 3, 1> (Chords: (9, 2) and (5, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 5, 4, 8, 6, 1> (Chords: (9, 8) and (5, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 5, 4, 2, 7, 1> (Chords: (9, 2) and (5, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 5, 2, 7, 1> (Chord: (9, 2))
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 3, 0, 6, 1> (Chord: (3, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 8, 4, 5, 2, 7, 1> (Chords: (8, 2) and (5, 7))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

There are a total of [10] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
