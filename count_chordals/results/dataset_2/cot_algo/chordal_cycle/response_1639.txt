Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<Chordal 4-cycles>
1. [6] <(3, 15, 0, 22), (15, 7)>
2. [5] <(3, 20, 8, 5), (20, 3)>
3. [2] <(3, 2, 22, 0), (2, 3)>
4. [4] <(15, 7, 21, 29), (7, 15)>
5. [3] <(22, 0, 15, 7), (0, 22)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
