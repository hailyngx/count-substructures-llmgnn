Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 13) (16, 18) (16, 4) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 6) (4, 16) (4, 9) (4, 17) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 12) (1, 14) (1, 6) (1, 12) (17, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 7) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 9) (15, 5) (15, 6) (6, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 19) (6, 15) (10, 13) (10, 0) (12, 16) (12, 14) (12, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 18) (7, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 19) (9, 7) (18, 16) (18, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (6, 19, 9, 14, 12, 16, 4)
- Cycle 2: (6, 19, 9, 14, 0, 8, 13)
- Cycle 3: (14, 1, 6, 15, 5, 7, 3)
- Cycle 4: (14, 1, 6, 13, 10, 0, 8)
- Cycle 5: (14, 0, 8, 11, 16, 4, 9)
- Cycle 6: (14, 0, 2, 10, 13, 8, 11)
- Cycle 7: (14, 9, 4, 16, 12, 1, 6)
- Cycle 8: (12, 1, 6, 15, 5, 19, 9)
- Cycle 9: (12, 1, 6, 13, 8, 0, 14)
- Cycle 10: (12, 14, 0, 8, 11, 16, 4)
- Cycle 11: (12, 14, 1, 6, 15, 5, 7)
- Cycle 12: (4, 9, 19, 5, 15, 6, 1)
- Cycle 13: (4, 9, 19, 6, 13, 8, 0)
- Cycle 14: (4, 16, 12, 1, 6, 15, 5)
- Cycle 15: (4, 16, 18, 7, 3, 6, 1)
- Cycle 16: (4, 16, 11, 8, 0, 10, 13)
- Cycle 17: (7, 3, 6, 15, 5, 19, 9)
- Cycle 18: (7, 3, 6, 1, 12, 14, 0)
- Cycle 19: (7, 18, 16, 11, 8, 13, 6)
- Cycle 20: (8, 13, 10, 0, 14, 1, 6)

Step 2:
Identifying the chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (6, 15), 5, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (6, 13), 8, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (16, 12), 1, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (16, 11), 8, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <7, (3, 6), 15, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <7, (3, 6), 1, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (18, 11), 16, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (13, 10), 0, 14>

Step 3:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [20 - 8 = 12].
