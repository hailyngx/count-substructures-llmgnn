Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 12) (22, 9) (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (16, 11) (16, 18) (16, 23) (16, 20) (18, 16) (18, 23) (18, 20) (18, 1) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 4) (1, 18) (1, 25) (26, 10) (26, 28) (26, 8) (17, 29) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 4) (29, 17) (29, 28) (29, 5) (28, 26) (28, 29) (28, 27) (9, 22) (9, 17) (9, 2) (6, 21) (6, 7) (21, 6) (21, 12) (21, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 0) (20, 16) (20, 18) (20, 19) (14, 11) (14, 15) (14, 25) (15, 14) (15, 19) (19, 20) (19, 15) (19, 3) (19, 12) (23, 16) (23, 18) (3, 19) (3, 24) (3, 5) (3, 8) (24, 3) (24, 8) (24, 12) (8, 26) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 24) (8, 27) (2, 9) (2, 27) (25, 1) (25, 14) (12, 13) (12, 21) (12, 19) (12, 24) (27, 28) (27, 8) (27, 2) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 29) (5, 21) (5, 3) (4, 10) (4, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- (11, 16, 23, 18)
- (11, 16, 20, 18)
- (11, 14, 25, 1)
- (16, 18, 1, 25)
- (10, 26, 28, 27)
- (17, 29, 28, 27)
- (17, 29, 5, 21)
- (7, 11, 16, 18)
- (7, 11, 14, 25)
- (7, 6, 21, 5)
- (20, 16, 11, 7)
- (20, 16, 18, 1)
- (20, 18, 1, 25)
- (14, 11, 7, 6)
- (14, 11, 16, 18)
- (14, 15, 19, 20)
- (15, 19, 20, 16)
- (15, 19, 12, 21)
- (19, 20, 16, 11)
- (19, 15, 14, 11)
- (19, 3, 24, 12)
- (23, 16, 11, 7)
- (23, 18, 1, 25)
- (3, 19, 15, 14)
- (3, 19, 20, 16)
- (3, 8, 24, 12)
- (24, 3, 19, 15)
- (24, 3, 8, 27)
- (24, 12, 21, 5)
- (8, 3, 19, 20)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <11, 16, 23, 18> (Chord: 16, 18)
- <11, 14, 25, 1> (Chord: 14, 25)
- <10, 26, 28, 27> (Chord: 26, 28)
- <17, 29, 28, 27> (Chord: 29, 28)
- <17, 29, 5, 21> (Chord: 29, 21)
- <7, 11, 16, 18> (Chord: 11, 16)
- <7, 11, 14, 25> (Chord: 11, 14)
- <7, 6, 21, 5> (Chord: 6, 5)
- <20, 16, 11, 7> (Chord: 16, 11)
- <20, 18, 1, 25> (Chord: 18, 25)
- <14, 15, 19, 20> (Chord: 15, 19)
- <15, 19, 12, 21> (Chord: 19, 12)
- <23, 16, 11, 7> (Chord: 16, 11)
- <3, 19, 15, 14> (Chord: 19, 15)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is **[14]**.
