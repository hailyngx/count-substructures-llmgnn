- Cycle 3: 1-9-2-4-12-3-1
- Cycle 4: 1-11-14-11
- Cycle 5: 1-11-5-13-1
- Cycle 6: 1-11-4-12-3-1
- Cycle 7: 3-1-11-5-13-3
- Cycle 8: 3-1-9-10-7-3
- Cycle 9: 3-1-9-2-4-12-3

- Cycle 19: 10-6-5-8-3-10
- Cycle 20: 10-6-4-12-10
- Cycle 21: 10-11-5-13-10
- Cycle 22: 10-11-1-9-10
- Cycle 23: 10-11-4-12-3-10
- Cycle 24: 11-14-11

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, 9, 7, 10>
- <1, 9, 2, 4>
- <1, 11, 5, 13>
- <1, 11, 4, 12>
- <3, 1, 9, 10>
- <3, 1, 9, 2>
- <3, 7, 10, 12>
- <3, 7, 9, 2>
- <3, 8, 5, 6>
- <3, 8, 0, 4>
- <10, 9, 7, 3>
- <10, 9, 2, 4>
- <10, 11, 5, 13>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [13]
