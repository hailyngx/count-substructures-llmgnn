Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 15) (0, 2) (0, 15) (0, 1) (2, 0) (2, 11) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 17) (1, 10) (1, 18) (17, 1) (17, 11) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 4) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 15) (16, 12) (16, 9) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 2) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 15) (4, 19) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 11) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 12) (15, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (18, 8) (18, 1) (18, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1-5-7-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-3-13-1
- Cycle 3: 1-17-11-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-17-11-19-4-1
- Cycle 5: 1-17-11-19-5-1
- Cycle 6: 1-18-12-15-0-1
- Cycle 7: 1-18-12-16-9-11-1
- Cycle 8: 1-18-12-15-6-7-1
- Cycle 9: 1-18-8-14-13-1
- Cycle 10: 1-18-8-14-3-1
- Cycle 11: 1-18-8-7-6-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <1, 5, 7, 6, 1> has a chord: (5, 6)
- <1, 5, 3, 13, 1> has a chord: (5, 13)
- <1, 17, 11, 2, 1> has a chord: (17, 2)
- <1, 17, 11, 19, 4, 1> has a chord: (11, 4)
- <1, 17, 11, 19, 5, 1> has a chord: (11, 5)
- <1, 18, 12, 15, 0, 1> has a chord: (12, 0)
- <1, 18, 12, 16, 9, 11, 1> has a chord: (12, 9)
- <1, 18, 12, 15, 6, 7, 1> has a chord: (12, 7)
- <1, 18, 8, 14, 13, 1> has a chord: (8, 13)
- <1, 18, 8, 14, 3, 1> has a chord: (8, 3)
- <1, 18, 8, 7, 6, 1> has a chord: (8, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
