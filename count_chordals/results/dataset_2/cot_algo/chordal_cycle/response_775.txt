Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 19) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 18) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 15) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 7) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 14) (15, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 12) (16, 0) (16, 2) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 19) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 4) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 11) (14, 18) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 17) (18, 3) (18, 14) (18, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 9) (6, 10) (6, 18) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 16) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 17) (12, 0) (12, 10) (12, 6) (17, 9) (17, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- C1: 3-8-14-19-11-9-4-5-13-15-3
- C2: 3-18-14-19-11-9-4-5-13-15-3
- C3: 3-8-13-15-3
- C4: 5-13-15-3-7-5
- C5: 11-14-8-13-15-11
- C6: 11-9-4-5-7-11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <3-8-14-19-11-9-4-5-13-15-3, (19, 5)>
- <3-8-14-19-11-9-4-5-13-15-3, (19, 11)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

Put the final number inside brackets [], which is [2].
