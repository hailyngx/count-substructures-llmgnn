Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 6) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
Possible cycles in the graph:
1. (5, 9, 7, 6, 5)
2. (10, 13, 4, 6, 10)
3. (10, 13, 14, 2, 10)
4. (10, 14, 13, 4, 10)
5. (11, 10, 14, 13, 11)
6. (11, 10, 2, 0, 11)
7. (11, 1, 0, 8, 11)
8. (13, 10, 2, 0, 13)
9. (13, 10, 14, 2, 13)
10. (13, 14, 2, 0, 13)
11. (4, 13, 10, 12, 4)
12. (4, 13, 6, 7, 4)
13. (4, 12, 5, 2, 4)
14. (4, 12, 3, 0, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
From the listed cycles, only one cycle has exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (12,5), 2>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final answer is [1].
