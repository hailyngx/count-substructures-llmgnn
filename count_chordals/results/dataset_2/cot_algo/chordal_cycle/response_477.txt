Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 6) (14, 17) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 19) (17, 2) (8, 11) (8, 1) (13, 14) (13, 10) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 18) (12, 19) (5, 7) (5, 18) (19, 17) (19, 12) (19, 10) (19, 1) (9, 18) (9, 11) (9, 0) (10, 15) (10, 13) (10, 19) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 6) (16, 4) (11, 8) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 4) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 9) (6, 15) (6, 0) (1, 8) (1, 19) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 17) (4, 16) (4, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 12, 7) 
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 10, 13)
- Cycle 3: (3, 15, 18, 5)
- Cycle 4: (3, 15, 18, 12)
- Cycle 5: (3, 15, 7, 5)
- Cycle 6: (14, 17, 19, 12)
- Cycle 7: (14, 17, 2, 3)
- Cycle 8: (14, 17, 2, 14)
- Cycle 9: (14, 2, 3, 15)
- Cycle 10: (14, 2, 17, 19)
- Cycle 11: (17, 19, 10, 13)
- Cycle 12: (17, 19, 1, 0)
- Cycle 13: (17, 2, 3, 15)
- Cycle 14: (8, 11, 4, 16)
- Cycle 15: (8, 11, 0, 9)
- Cycle 16: (8, 11, 0, 1)
- Cycle 17: (8, 1, 19, 17)
- Cycle 18: (13, 14, 2, 3)
- Cycle 19: (5, 7, 12, 19)
- Cycle 20: (5, 7, 15, 10)
- Cycle 21: (5, 18, 12, 19)
- Cycle 22: (5, 18, 3, 15)
- Cycle 23: (19, 17, 2, 3)
- Cycle 24: (19, 17, 14, 13)
- Cycle 25: (19, 12, 7, 15)
- Cycle 26: (9, 18, 12, 19)
- Cycle 27: (9, 18, 3, 15)
- Cycle 28: (9, 11, 8, 1)
- Cycle 29: (10, 15, 7, 5)
- Cycle 30: (10, 15, 3, 2)
- Cycle 31: (10, 13, 14, 17)
- Cycle 32: (0, 9, 11, 8)
- Cycle 33: (0, 9, 18, 3)
- Cycle 34: (0, 11, 4, 16)
- Cycle 35: (0, 11, 8, 1)
- Cycle 36: (16, 4, 11, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <3, 15, 12, 7, (3, 7)>
- <3, 15, 7, 5, (7, 5)>
- <14, 17, 19, 12, (17, 12)>
- <14, 17, 2, 3, (17, 3)>
- <8, 11, 0, 9, (11, 9)>
- <13, 14, 2, 3, (14, 3)>
- <5, 7, 12, 19, (7, 19)>
- <19, 17, 2, 3, (17, 3)>
- <9, 18, 12, 19, (18, 19)>
- <10, 15, 3, 2, (15, 3)>
- <0, 9, 11, 8, (9, 11)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
