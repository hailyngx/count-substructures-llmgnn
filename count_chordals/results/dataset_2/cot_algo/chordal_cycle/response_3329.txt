Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 14) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (4, 11) (12, 9) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 14) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 11) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 4) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 14, 4, 13, 3, 9, 1>
- Cycle 2: <5, 10, 14, 4, 13, 3, 9, 1>
- Cycle 3: <8, 7, 2, 1, 9, 12>
- Cycle 4: <11, 0, 6, 14, 10, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (10, 5)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (0, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 4 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 6, 14, 4, (9, 1), 13, 3, 9>
- <5, 10, 14, 4, (10, 5), 13, 3, 9>
- <8, 7, 2, 1, (1, 9), 12>
- <11, 0, 6, 14, (0, 6), 10, 5>
