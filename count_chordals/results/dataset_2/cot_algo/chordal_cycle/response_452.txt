Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-8-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-9-7-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-8-2-7-0
- Cycle 4: 2-6-0-3-2
- Cycle 5: 2-6-5-7-2

Step 2:
Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 2)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (9, 2)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (8, 7)
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (9, 2)>
<2, (8, 7)>
