Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-5-3-1
- Cycle 2: 1-6-8-4-1
- Cycle 3: 1-9-4-8-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-2-8-1
- Cycle 5: 1-9-0-4-1
- Cycle 6: 1-9-2-7-1
- Cycle 7: 1-3-5-6-1
- Cycle 8: 1-3-4-8-1
- Cycle 9: 1-3-5-3-1
- Cycle 10: 1-4-8-7-1
- Cycle 11: 1-4-0-7-1
- Cycle 12: 1-2-8-7-1
- Cycle 13: 1-2-0-7-1
- Cycle 14: 3-6-5-3
- Cycle 15: 3-6-1-9-3
- Cycle 16: 4-9-0-7-4
- Cycle 17: 4-9-2-7-4
- Cycle 18: 4-1-3-5-4
- Cycle 19: 8-4-0-7-8
- Cycle 20: 8-4-9-2-8
- Cycle 21: 8-4-1-3-8

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 6, (5, 3), 1>
- <1, 6, (8, 4), 1>
- <1, 9, (4, 8), 1>
- <1, 9, (2, 8), 1>
- <1, 9, (0, 4), 1>
- <1, 9, (2, 7), 1>
- <1, 3, (5, 6), 1>
- <1, 3, (4, 8), 1>
- <1, 3, (5, 3), 1>
- <1, 4, (8, 7), 1>
- <1, 4, (0, 7), 1>
- <1, 2, (8, 7), 1>
- <1, 2, (0, 7), 1>
- <3, 6, (5, 3), 3>
- <3, 6, 1, 9, 3>
- <4, 9, (0, 7), 4>
- <4, 9, (2, 7), 4>
- <4, 1, 3, 5, 4>
- <8, 4, (0, 7), 8>
- <8, 4, (9, 2), 8>
- <8, 4, (1, 3), 8>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have found a total of [21] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
