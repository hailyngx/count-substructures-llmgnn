Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 23) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 26) (22, 14) (5, 9) (5, 16) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 2) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 6) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 1) (23, 13) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 24) (20, 2) (20, 11) (2, 9) (2, 20) (2, 7) (18, 27) (18, 26) (18, 12) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 18) (26, 17) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 3) (4, 10) (4, 25) (4, 29) (4, 21) (12, 18) (12, 6) (3, 8) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 19) (28, 3) (28, 14) (17, 26) (17, 25) (17, 16) (17, 11) (25, 9) (25, 4) (25, 17) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 14) (15, 19) (19, 3) (19, 15) (7, 2) (7, 10) (29, 0) (29, 4) (1, 27) (1, 24) (11, 20) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 21) (14, 22) (14, 28) (14, 16) (21, 4) (21, 11) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 7) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 11) (24, 23) (24, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle 1: 5-9-2-20-11-17-16-5
2. Cycle 2: 5-9-2-7-10-4-25-17-11-20-2-5
3. Cycle 3: 5-9-2-20-11-6-12-18-26-23-24-1-27-0-6-13-22-14-28-3-19-15-5
4. Cycle 4: 5-9-2-7-10-8-3-28-14-22-26-17-11-20-2-5
5. Cycle 5: 5-16-17-25-4-21-11-20-2-9-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Cycle 5 contains exactly one chord: (2, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [0].
