Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 8) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 9) (11, 12) (11, 13) (11, 1) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 11) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 13 - 12 - 7
2. Cycle 2: 0 - 4 - 10 - 7 - 6
3. Cycle 3: 0 - 1 - 6 - 7 - 12
4. Cycle 4: 0 - 1 - 8 - 5 - 9
5. Cycle 5: 0 - 2 - 3 - 6 - 7
6. Cycle 6: 0 - 2 - 9 - 11 - 1
7. Cycle 7: 1 - 6 - 3 - 2 - 9
8. Cycle 8: 1 - 6 - 7 - 12 - 13
9. Cycle 9: 2 - 3 - 6 - 1 - 0
10. Cycle 10: 2 - 9 - 11 - 13 - 12
11. Cycle 11: 3 - 2 - 0 - 4 - 14
12. Cycle 12: 3 - 6 - 7 - 10 - 4

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 4, 10, 7, (6, 12)>
2. <0, 4, 13, 12, (7, 6)>
3. <0, 1, 8, 5, (9, 11)>
4. <0, 2, 3, 6, (1, 7)>
5. <1, 6, 3, 2, (9, 11)>
6. <2, 3, 6, 1, (0, 7)>

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [6].
