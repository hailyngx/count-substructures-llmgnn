Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 6) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 10) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 11) (10, 13) (10, 6) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5-1-3-7-4-9-2-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-14-2-9-4-7-5
- Cycle 3: 5-8-7-4-13-12-5
- Cycle 4: 5-12-13-8-7-0-6-5
- Cycle 5: 9-11-12-13-10-6-14-9
- Cycle 6: 4-9-11-12-13-10-6-4
- Cycle 7: 4-9-2-3-13-12-11-4
- Cycle 8: 4-7-3-2-5-8-13-4
- Cycle 9: 7-0-6-10-13-12-11-7
- Cycle 10: 1-5-8-13-12-11-9-1

Step 2:
Checking cycles for a chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: <1, 3>
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <1, 14>
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <8, 13>
- Cycle 4 has a chord: <5, 12>
- Cycle 5 has a chord: <6, 10>
- Cycle 6 has a chord: <9, 11>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <2, 3>
- Cycle 8 has a chord: <2, 5>
- Cycle 9 has a chord: <0, 6>
- Cycle 10 has a chord: <5, 8>

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, 3, 7, 5>
<1, 14, 9, 4>
<5, 12, 13, 8>
<10, 6, 0, 7>
<6, 10, 13, 12>
<9, 11, 12, 13>
<2, 3, 7, 4>
<2, 5, 8, 1>
<7, 3, 0, 6>
<8, 5, 1, 14>
