Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:  
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 5, 6)  
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 8, 4)  
- Cycle 3: (0, 8, 4, 6)  
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 6, 7)  
- Cycle 5: (1, 8, 4, 3)  
- Cycle 6: (2, 4, 3, 7)  
- Cycle 7: (2, 4, 8, 1)  
- Cycle 8: (2, 7, 6, 5)  
- Cycle 9: (2, 9, 6, 7)  
- Cycle 10: (3, 4, 6, 7)  
- Cycle 11: (3, 6, 7, 2)  
- Cycle 12: (4, 8, 1, 5)  
- Cycle 13: (5, 6, 7, 3)  
- Cycle 14: (5, 8, 1, 0)  
- Cycle 15: (6, 7, 3, 2)  
- Cycle 16: (6, 9, 2, 4)  

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:  
- <0, 1, (5, 6)>  
- <1, 8, (4, 3)>  
- <2, 4, (3, 7)>  
- <2, 4, (1, 8)>  
- <2, 7, (6, 5)>  
- <2, 9, (6, 7)>  
- <3, 4, (6, 7)>  
- <4, 8, (1, 5)>  
- <5, 6, (7, 3)>  
- <6, 7, (3, 2)>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:  
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0] since all cycles had at least one chord.
