Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 3) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 9) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (5, 3) (5, 1) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 9) (14, 8) (14, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 9) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (3, 4, 7, 12)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 8, 14, 1)
        - Cycle 3: (0, 8, 3, 2)
        - Cycle 4: (3, 8, 14, 1)
        - Cycle 5: (3, 11, 2, 9)
        - Cycle 6: (0, 8, 3, 5)
        - Cycle 7: (0, 1, 11, 6)
        - Cycle 8: (0, 13, 7, 12)
        - Cycle 9: (4, 7, 12, 6)
        - Cycle 10: (4, 11, 2, 3)
        - Cycle 11: (4, 11, 1, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (7, 12) -> <1, (7, 12), 3>
        - Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (8, 1) -> <2, (8, 1), 14>
        - Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (8, 3) -> <3, (8, 3), 2>
        - Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (8, 14) -> <4, (8, 14), 1>
        - Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (8, 3) -> <5, (8, 3), 5>
        - Cycle 7 has exactly one chord: (1, 11) -> <6, (1, 11), 6>
        - Cycle 8 has exactly one chord: (0, 12) -> <7, (0, 12), 13>
        - Cycle 9 has exactly one chord: (7, 6) -> <8, (7, 6), 12>
        - Cycle 10 has exactly one chord: (11, 3) -> <9, (11, 3), 2>
        - Cycle 11 has exactly one chord: (11, 14) -> <10, (11, 14), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [10].
