Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 2) (15, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 17) (17, 11) (17, 0) (17, 19) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 18) (18, 11) (18, 2) (18, 7) (18, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 19) (12, 1) (12, 7) (12, 4) (8, 14) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 7) (0, 4) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 0) (16, 19) (5, 14) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 19) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 18) (19, 17) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle <1, 3, 15, 3>
2. Cycle <1, 3, 2, 1>
3. Cycle <1, 2, 3, 1>
4. Cycle <1, 2, 6, 4, 12, 1>
5. Cycle <1, 2, 18, 11, 17, 0, 7, 12, 1>
6. Cycle <1, 11, 18, 7, 0, 9, 6, 2, 1>
7. Cycle <1, 12, 7, 0, 9, 6, 2, 1>
8. Cycle <7, 10, 11, 18, 2, 6, 9, 0, 7>
9. Cycle <7, 12, 1, 2, 6, 9, 0, 7>
10. Cycle <7, 18, 11, 17, 0, 9, 6, 2, 7>
11. Cycle <7, 0, 9, 6, 2, 1, 12, 7>
12. Cycle <7, 19, 17, 0, 9, 6, 2, 18, 7>
13. Cycle <12, 1, 2, 6, 9, 0, 7, 18, 12>
14. Cycle <12, 4, 6, 9, 0, 7, 18, 11, 12>
15. Cycle <14, 8, 14, 5, 14>
16. Cycle <14, 5, 14, 19, 16, 19, 14>
17. Cycle <19, 17, 11, 18, 7, 0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 18, 2, 1, 12, 7, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. <1, 2, 3, 1> (Chord: None)
2. <1, 2, 6, 4, 12, 1> (Chord: (4, 12))
3. <19, 17, 11, 18, 7, 0, 4, 6, 9, 13, 18, 2, 1, 12, 7, 19> (Chord: (9, 13))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]
