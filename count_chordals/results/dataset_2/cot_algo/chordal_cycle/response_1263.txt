Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 20) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 0) (8, 13) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 29) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 22) (20, 1) (20, 27) (20, 28) (7, 1) (7, 19) (12, 25) (6, 17) (28, 20) (28, 10) (14, 0) (14, 27) (14, 4) (14, 21) (5, 13) (5, 25) (5, 15) (24, 26) (24, 9) (26, 24) (26, 15) (26, 29) (26, 21) (26, 11) (17, 3) (17, 6) (17, 15) (9, 8) (9, 24) (9, 18) (9, 19) (19, 7) (19, 9) (18, 1) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 16) (15, 5) (15, 26) (15, 17) (15, 29) (15, 2) (4, 14) (29, 13) (29, 26) (29, 15) (29, 16) (16, 18) (16, 29) (16, 22) (16, 10) (10, 28) (10, 18) (10, 16) (11, 26) (11, 18) (11, 22) (11, 27) (11, 2) (22, 0) (22, 16) (22, 11) (27, 20) (27, 14) (27, 11) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 23) (25, 21) (2, 15) (2, 11) (2, 21) (23, 25) (21, 14) (21, 26) (21, 25) (21, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 7-1-20-27-14-0-3-17-6
- Cycle 2: 4-14-27-20-28-10-18-1-7
- Cycle 3: 9-8-13-5-25-12-25-21-26
- Cycle 4: 2-15-5-13-8-18-10-16-29
- Cycle 5: 7-19-9-8-13-29-16-18-10
- Cycle 6: 26-11-22-0-3-17-15-2-21

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (1, 27)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (14, 20)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (13, 21)
- Cycle 4 is chordal
- Cycle 5 is chordal
- Cycle 6 is chordal

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, 14, 27, 20>
- <9, 8, 13, 5, 25>
- <2, 15, 5, 13, 8, 18, 10, 16>
