Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0)

7. (7, 6, 4, 9, 8)
8. (7, 6, 4, 9, 3)
9. (6, 4, 9, 7)
10. (6, 4, 9, 8, 2)
11. (6, 4, 9, 3)
12. (6, 9, 4, 7)

21. (9, 4, 6, 7, 1)
22. (9, 8, 2, 6)
23. (9, 8, 2, 6, 4)
24. (9, 8, 2, 6, 7)
25. (9, 3, 7, 6)
26. (9, 3, 0, 6)
27. (9, 3, 7, 6, 4)
28. (9, 3, 7, 6, 4, 9)
29. (9, 3, 7, 1, 6)
30. (9, 3, 7, 1, 5, 2, 8)
31. (8, 2, 6, 9)
32. (8, 2, 6, 7, 3, 0)
33. (8, 2, 6, 7, 3)
34. (8, 2, 6, 4)
35. (8, 2, 6, 4, 9)
36. (8, 2, 6, 7)
37. (8, 2, 5)
38. (1, 7, 3, 9)
39. (1, 7, 6, 9)
40. (1, 7, 3, 0)
41. (1, 7, 6, 4)
42. (1, 7, 3, 9, 8, 2)
43. (3, 9, 4, 6)
44. (3, 9, 7, 6)
45. (3, 9, 4, 6, 7)
46. (3, 9, 8, 2, 6, 4)
47. (3, 9, 8, 2, 6, 7)
48. (3, 0, 6, 4)
49. (3, 0, 6, 7)
50. (3, 0, 6, 4, 9)
51. (0, 6, 4, 9)
52. (0, 6, 9, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The only cycle with exactly one chord is (7, 6, 9, 4) with a chord between 7 and 4.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1], and the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <7, 6, 9, 4>.
