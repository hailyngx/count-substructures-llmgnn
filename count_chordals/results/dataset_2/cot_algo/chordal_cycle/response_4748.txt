Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph, including:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-7-8-5
- Cycle 2: 5-4-0-6-5
- Cycle 3: 5-3-2-1-5
- Cycle 4: 9-7-6-0-9
- Cycle 5: 4-0-6-2-4
- Cycle 6: 7-9-3-2-7
- Cycle 7: 3-5-4-2-3
- Cycle 8: 2-4-1-7-2
- Cycle 9: 8-5-1-2-8
- Cycle 10: 6-7-1-2-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Among these cycles, the cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
- <5, (4, 8), 9>
- <5, (0, 6), 4>
- <5, (2, 1), 3>
- <9, (7, 6), 0>
- <4, (2, 6), 0>
- <7, (3, 2), 9>
- <3, (4, 2), 5>
- <2, (1, 7), 4>
- <8, (1, 2), 5>
- <6, (1, 2), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

So, there are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph: [<10>].
