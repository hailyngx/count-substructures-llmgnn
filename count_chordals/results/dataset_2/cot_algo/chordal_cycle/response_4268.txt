Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 6) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 12) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 13) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-10-1-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-3-0-5
- Cycle 3: 5-11-1-3-5
- Cycle 4: 5-4-0-3-5
- Cycle 5: 5-9-7-0-5
- Cycle 6: 5-11-13-3-5
- Cycle 7: 5-4-13-6-5
- Cycle 8: 9-2-3-1-9
- Cycle 9: 9-10-12-7-9
- Cycle 10: 1-14-0-3-1
- Cycle 11: 1-10-12-7-1
- Cycle 12: 3-13-6-4-3
- Cycle 13: 10-12-7-0-10
- Cycle 14: 5-1-10-9-5
- Cycle 15: 5-1-11-13-5
- Cycle 16: 5-1-14-0-5
- Cycle 17: 5-1-3-13-5
- Cycle 18: 5-9-2-3-5
- Cycle 19: 9-7-12-10-9
- Cycle 20: 1-3-2-9-1
- Cycle 21: 1-3-0-4-1
- Cycle 22: 1-10-9-2-1
- Cycle 23: 3-0-4-13-3
- Cycle 24: 3-1-10-12-3
- Cycle 25: 3-13-6-14-3
- Cycle 26: 9-10-1-5-9
- Cycle 27: 9-10-1-11-9
- Cycle 28: 10-9-5-4-10
- Cycle 29: 10-1-3-2-10
- Cycle 30: 10-12-7-0-10
- Cycle 31: 1-11-5-4-1
- Cycle 32: 3-1-5-4-3
- Cycle 33: 3-1-11-5-3
- Cycle 34: 3-0-7-9-3
- Cycle 35: 13-3-1-5-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycle found is:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (1, 3), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since we found 1 chordal 4-cycle, the number of chordless cycles is [35].
