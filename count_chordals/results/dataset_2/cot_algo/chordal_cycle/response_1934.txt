Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 13) (6, 16) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 11) (17, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 13) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 8) (4, 9) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 7) (1, 17) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 12) (12, 5) (12, 15) (12, 14) (7, 13) (7, 11) (11, 17) (11, 7) (11, 0) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 3) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 19) (8, 18) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 16) (19, 2) (19, 3) (16, 6) (16, 10) (16, 18) (16, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 9, 6, 13, 5, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 17, 10, 16, 6, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 17, 1, 15, 12, 5, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 18, 2, 13, 7, 11, 0, 3, 17, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 18, 16, 10, 17, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 18, 16, 14, 12, 15, 1, 17, 3, 0, 11, 7, 13, 4)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 2: Chord (10, 16)
- Cycle 3: Chord (12, 15)
- Cycle 4: Chord (3, 17)
- Cycle 5: Chord (10, 17)
- Cycle 6: Chord (16, 14)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<4, 9, 6, 13, 5> (Chord: (6, 9))
<4, 17, 10, 16, 6> (Chord: (10, 16))
<4, 17, 1, 15, 12> (Chord: (12, 15))
<4, 18, 2, 13, 7> (Chord: (3, 17))
<4, 18, 16, 10, 17> (Chord: (10, 17))
<4, 18, 16, 14, 12> (Chord: (16, 14))
