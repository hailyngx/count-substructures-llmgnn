Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 8) (14, 17) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (6, 15) (6, 9) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 19) (5, 14) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 15) (8, 19) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 13) (19, 12) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 11) (10, 14) (10, 0) (10, 1) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 2) (16, 4) (1, 10) (1, 13) (2, 7) (2, 16) (4, 0) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 11) (13, 19) (13, 1) (13, 4) (11, 6) (11, 18) (11, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 3-15-18-19-3
- Cycle 2: 3-15-8-19-3
- Cycle 3: 3-12-19-13-3
- Cycle 4: 6-15-8-19-6
- Cycle 5: 6-15-18-11-6
- Cycle 6: 9-6-11-4-9
- Cycle 7: 9-7-3-12-9
- Cycle 8: 9-0-5-14-9
- Cycle 9: 9-0-10-1-9
- Cycle 10: 5-0-4-16-5
- Cycle 11: 7-3-12-16-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <3, (15, 18), 19>
- Cycle 2: <3, (15, 8), 19>
- Cycle 3: <3, (12, 13), 19>
- Cycle 4: <6, (15, 8), 19>
- Cycle 5: <6, (15, 18), 11>
- Cycle 6: <9, (6, 11), 4>
- Cycle 7: <9, (3, 12), 16>
- Cycle 8: <9, (0, 14), 5>
- Cycle 9: <9, (0, 10), 1>
- Cycle 10: <5, (0, 4), 16>
- Cycle 11: <7, (3, 12), 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
