Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 1) (3, 11) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 6) (9, 11) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 1) (2, 11) (2, 12) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 6) (6, 11) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 14) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (3, 8, 4, 9) with edges (3, 8), (8, 4), (4, 9), (9, 3)
- Cycle 2: (7, 8, 4, 9) with edges (7, 8), (8, 4), (4, 9), (9, 7)
- Cycle 3: (12, 7, 8, 4) with edges (12, 7), (7, 8), (8, 4), (4, 12)
- Cycle 4: (10, 11, 5, 13) with edges (10, 11), (11, 5), (5, 13), (13, 10)
- Cycle 5: (11, 5, 13, 1) with edges (11, 5), (5, 13), (13, 1), (1, 11)
- Cycle 6: (5, 13, 1, 9) with edges (5, 13), (13, 1), (1, 9), (9, 5)
- Cycle 7: (13, 1, 9, 4) with edges (13, 1), (1, 9), (9, 4), (4, 13)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords
- Cycle 2 has no chords
- Cycle 3 has no chords
- Cycle 4 has no chords
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (11, 13)
- Cycle 6 has no chords
- Cycle 7 has no chords

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
In this case, there is only one chordal 4-cycle, which is cycle 5 with the chord (11, 13).

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, (11, 13)>.
