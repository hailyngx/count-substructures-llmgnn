Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-4-9-0
- Cycle 2: 1-2-4-9-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-6-7-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-6-4-1
- Cycle 5: 2-4-9-2
- Cycle 6: 3-6-7-1-3
- Cycle 7: 4-6-9-4
- Cycle 8: 5-8-1-3-5
- Cycle 9: 6-7-1-3-6
- Cycle 10: 6-9-4-1-6
- Cycle 11: 7-0-1-3-7
- Cycle 12: 7-6-3-1-7
- Cycle 13: 8-1-3-5-8
- Cycle 14: 9-0-1-4-9
- Cycle 15: 9-2-1-4-9


Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal cycles (cycles with exactly one chord) are:
- Cycle 4: 1-3-6-4-1 with chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 9: 6-7-1-3-6 with chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 11: 7-0-1-3-7 with chord (0, 1)


Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [12].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, (3, 6), 4>
- <6, (1, 7), 3>
- <7, (0, 1), 3>
