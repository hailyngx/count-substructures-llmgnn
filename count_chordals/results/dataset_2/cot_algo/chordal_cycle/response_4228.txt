Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-7-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-9-3-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-9-3-0
- Cycle 4: 0-2-7-5-0
- Cycle 5: 0-4-9-3-0
- Cycle 6: 0-4-2-7-0
- Cycle 7: 1-9-3-1
- Cycle 8: 1-0-4-3-1
- Cycle 9: 1-7-2-5-1
- Cycle 10: 2-9-4-0-2
- Cycle 11: 2-7-5-6-2

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 2: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 3: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 4: <7, 5>
- Cycle 5: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 6: <4, 7>
- Cycle 7: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 8: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 9: Chordless cycle
- Cycle 10: <0, 4>
- Cycle 11: Chordless cycle

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: 7

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <7, 5>
- <4, 7>
- <0, 4>
