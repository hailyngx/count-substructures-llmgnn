Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 10) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 14) (11, 9) (11, 3) (11, 13) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 13) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 4) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle (5, 9, 3, 2, 5)
2. Cycle (4, 7, 5, 8, 4)
3. Cycle (4, 12, 3, 11, 4)
4. Cycle (8, 5, 2, 10, 8)
5. Cycle (12, 4, 0, 1, 8, 12)
6. Cycle (10, 0, 13, 6, 10)
7. Cycle (14, 4, 0, 13, 14)
8. Cycle (13, 11, 3, 2, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Cycle (5, 9, 3, 2, 5) has chord (9, 2)
2. Cycle (4, 7, 5, 8, 4) has chord (7, 8)
3. Cycle (4, 12, 3, 11, 4) has chord (12, 11)
4. Cycle (8, 5, 2, 10, 8) has chord (5, 10)
5. Cycle (12, 4, 0, 1, 8, 12) has chord (4, 8)
6. Cycle (10, 0, 13, 6, 10) has chord (0, 13)
7. Cycle (14, 4, 0, 13, 14) has chord (4, 13)
8. Cycle (13, 11, 3, 2, 13) has chord (11, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final number is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <5, (9, 2), 3>
2. <4, (7, 8), 5>
3. <4, (12, 11), 3>
4. <8, (5, 10), 2>
5. <12, (4, 8), 0>
6. <10, (0, 13), 6>
7. <14, (4, 13), 0>
8. <13, (11, 2), 3>
