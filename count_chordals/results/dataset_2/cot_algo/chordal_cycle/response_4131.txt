Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 

Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-7-5-6-4-0
- Cycle 2: 1-7-5-8-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-2-9-1 
- Cycle 4: 1-3-4-6-1
- Cycle 5: 2-3-4-0-2
- Cycle 6: 4-6-9-8-4

Step 2:

Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 6) 
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (3, 6)
- Cycle 5 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (6, 8)

Step 3:

Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, (5, 6), 4, 7>
<1, (5, 8), 7, 1>
<1, (3, 9), 2, 1>
<4, (6, 8), 9, 4>
