Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 4) (7, 28) (18, 4) (18, 22) (18, 28) (18, 8) (22, 18) (22, 16) (22, 10) (22, 8) (20, 0) (20, 21) (20, 14) (25, 8) (25, 15) (25, 21) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 24) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 27) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (0, 24) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 3) (28, 13) (29, 1) (29, 26) (29, 15) (14, 20) (14, 0) (14, 13) (1, 29) (1, 26) (26, 29) (26, 1) (26, 16) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 19) (17, 12) (17, 21) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 21) (5, 10) (5, 27) (11, 19) (23, 16) (23, 10) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 13) (16, 22) (16, 26) (16, 23) (16, 24) (24, 3) (24, 0) (24, 16) (19, 2) (19, 11) (13, 28) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 21) (21, 20) (21, 25) (21, 17) (21, 5) (21, 13) (15, 25) (15, 29) (27, 9) (27, 5) (8, 18) (8, 22) (8, 25) (10, 22) (10, 5) (10, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 28, 3, 4)
- Cycle 2: (18, 22, 10, 5, 21, 17, 12, 5, 6, 9, 2, 0, 20, 14, 13, 28, 18)
- Cycle 3: (22, 16, 26, 1, 29, 15, 25, 21, 17, 12, 13, 28, 3, 24, 16, 26)
- Cycle 4: (8, 25, 15, 29, 1, 26, 16, 24, 3, 0, 2, 9, 6, 5, 12, 17, 21, 25)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (7, 28) as the only chord.
- Cycle 2 has multiple chords, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 has a chord (16, 26) as the only chord.
- Cycle 4 has multiple chords, so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (7, 28), 3, 4>
- <3, (16, 26), 15, 25>
