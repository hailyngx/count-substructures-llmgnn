Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 1) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 18) (11, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 4) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 1) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 9) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 2) (17, 13) (17, 6) (17, 9) (0, 4) (0, 16) (0, 5) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (16, 14) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (9, 18) (9, 17) (9, 14) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 7) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 12) (2, 1) (2, 16) (14, 16) (14, 9) (14, 7) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<3, 8, 7, 6>
<10, 11, 6, 7>
<10, 11, 18, 19>
<10, 11, 6, 17>
<10, 18, 9, 14>
<10, 5, 0, 4>
<10, 5, 12, 19>
<10, 18, 9, 17>
<11, 6, 7, 8>
<11, 18, 19, 16>
<11, 6, 7, 14>
<11, 10, 5, 0>
<11, 10, 5, 12>
<18, 19, 16, 2>
<18, 19, 12, 3>
<18, 19, 16, 14>
<18, 11, 6, 7>
<18, 10, 5, 0>
<18, 10, 5, 12>
<18, 9, 14, 7>
<8, 7, 6, 11>
<8, 7, 6, 17>
<8, 7, 14, 9>
<8, 3, 12, 19>
<8, 3, 12, 5>
<8, 5, 0, 4>
<8, 5, 10, 11>
<8, 5, 12, 19>
<13, 4, 0, 16>
<13, 4, 1, 2>
<13, 17, 9, 14>
<13, 8, 7, 6>
<13, 8, 7, 14>
<4, 0, 16, 19>
<4, 0, 16, 14>
<4, 1, 15, 2>
<4, 13, 17, 6>
<4, 13, 8, 7>
<4, 13, 8, 5>
<18, 19, 12, 3>


Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<10, 11, 18, 19> - chord: (11, 18)
<10, 11, 6, 7> - chord: (6, 11)
<10, 18, 9, 14> - chord: (9, 14)
<10, 5, 0, 4> - chord: (0, 5)
<11, 6, 7, 8> - chord: (7, 8)
<18, 19, 16, 2> - chord: (16, 19)
<8, 7, 6, 11> - chord: (7, 6)
<13, 17, 9, 14> - chord: (9, 14)
<4, 13, 17, 6> - chord: (13, 17)
<18, 19, 12, 3> - chord: (12, 3)


Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 27 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final number is [27].
