Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 5) (12, 11) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 14) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 1, 2)
- Cycle 3: (5, 10, 11, 6)
- Cycle 4: (9, 8, 6, 7)
- Cycle 5: (11, 12, 5, 10)
- Cycle 6: (2, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 7: (2, 7, 3, 0)
- Cycle 8: (8, 9, 5, 12)
- Cycle 9: (10, 6, 14, 2)
- Cycle 10: (13, 14, 2, 7)
- Cycle 11: (3, 5, 4, 1)
- Cycle 12: (3, 7, 8, 9)
- Cycle 13: (4, 1, 6, 11)
- Cycle 14: (1, 14, 13, 10)

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- <5, (9, 7), 3, 5> with chord 7
- <5, (4, 1), 2, 5> with chord 1
- <5, (10, 11), 6, 5> with chord 11
- <9, (8, 6), 7, 9> with chord 6
- <11, (12, 5), 10, 11> with chord 12
- <2, (1, 4), 5, 2> with chord 4
- <2, (7, 3), 0, 2> with chord 3
- <8, (9, 5), 12, 8> with chord 5
- <10, (6, 14), 2, 10> with chord 6
- <13, (14, 2), 7, 13> with chord 14

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 4.

Therefore, the answer is [4].
