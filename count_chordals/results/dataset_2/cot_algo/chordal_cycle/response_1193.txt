Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: {5, 9, 8, 4}
- Cycle 2: {5, 6, 2, 1}
- Cycle 3: {5, 4, 7, 6}
- Cycle 4: {9, 8, 4, 7}
- Cycle 5: {9, 8, 0, 3}
- Cycle 6: {4, 7, 1, 2}
- Cycle 7: {8, 9, 3, 0}
- Cycle 8: {6, 7, 1, 2}

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1: {5, 9, 8, 4} has a chord {9, 4}.
- Cycle 2: {5, 6, 2, 1} has a chord {6, 1}.
- Cycle 3: {5, 4, 7, 6} has a chord {4, 7}.
- Cycle 4: {9, 8, 4, 7} has a chord {8, 7}.
- Cycle 5: {9, 8, 0, 3} has a chord {8, 0}.
- Cycle 6: {4, 7, 1, 2} has a chord {7, 1}.
- Cycle 7: {8, 9, 3, 0} has a chord {9, 0}.
- Cycle 8: {6, 7, 1, 2} has a chord {7, 2}.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (6, 1), 2>
- <6, (4, 7), 5>
- <9, (8, 0), 3>
- <4, (8, 7), 9>
- <8, (9, 0), 4>
- <7, (1, 7), 6>
