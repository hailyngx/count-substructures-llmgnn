Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-3-1
- Cycle 4: 1-8-3-1
- Cycle 5: 0-9-2-0
- Cycle 6: 0-7-6-0
- Cycle 7: 0-8-2-0
- Cycle 8: 0-7-4-8-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (1, 2)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (0, 9)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (0, 6)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (0, 2)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (4, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found. 
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (2, 5), 1>
<1, (4, 2), 1>
<1, (6, 3), 1>
<1, (8, 3), 1>
<0, (9, 2), 0>
<0, (6, 7), 0>
<0, (2, 0), 0>
<4, (7, 0), 8>

The final count is [8].
