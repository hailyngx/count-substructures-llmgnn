Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 14) (0, 2) (0, 12) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 10) (12, 7) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 12) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 10) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 1, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 11, 12, 7, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 6, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 10, 8, 1, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 12, 0, 2, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 13, 1, 4, 7)
- Cycle 7: (6, 14, 5, 8, 6)
- Cycle 8: (9, 3, 10, 2, 9)
- Cycle 9: (8, 5, 14, 6, 8)
- Cycle 10: (0, 12, 11, 4, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (4, 7), 12, 11> has a chord (4, 7)
- <1, 4, (7, 12), 0> has a chord (7, 12)
- <4, 6, (7, 9), 11> has a chord (7, 9)
- <4, (8, 10), 1, 11> has a chord (8, 10)
- <7, (0, 2), 5, 14> has a chord (0, 2)
- <7, 1, (4, 13), 7> has a chord (4, 13)
- <9, 3, (2, 10), 9> has a chord (2, 10)
- <8, (5, 14), 6, 8> has a chord (5, 14)
- <0, 12, (4, 11), 0> has a chord (4, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [9]
