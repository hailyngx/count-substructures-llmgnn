Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 6, 2)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 8, 1)
- Cycle 4: (5, 6, 9, 8)
- Cycle 5: (4, 6, 8, 7)
- Cycle 6: (4, 8, 9, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 4, 8, 9)
- Cycle 8: (6, 2, 4, 7)
- Cycle 9: (2, 6, 4, 8)
- Cycle 10: (1, 7, 4, 8) 

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has chord (4, 6)
- Cycle 2 has chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 3 has chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 4 has chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 5 has chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 6 has chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 7 has chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 8 has chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 9 has chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 10 has chord (4, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles with chords:
1. <1, (4, 6), 2>
2. <2, (4, 7), 1>
3. <3, (4, 8), 1>
4. <5, (6, 8), 9>
5. <6, (6, 8), 4>
6. <7, (5, 9), 8>
7. <8, (4, 7), 6>
8. <10, (4, 8), 1>
