Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 2) (5, 23) (9, 5) (9, 29) (9, 0) (9, 28) (9, 27) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 25) (3, 27) (3, 13) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 25) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 21) (25, 3) (25, 10) (25, 8) (28, 9) (28, 8) (29, 9) (0, 9) (0, 4) (7, 20) (7, 2) (15, 1) (15, 26) (15, 2) (6, 21) (6, 27) (6, 16) (21, 11) (21, 6) (23, 5) (23, 11) (26, 5) (26, 15) (26, 20) (26, 12) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 15) (2, 12) (12, 26) (12, 2) (12, 24) (22, 4) (22, 14) (8, 25) (8, 28) (8, 20) (8, 16) (4, 0) (4, 22) (16, 6) (16, 8) (16, 24) (16, 13) (16, 20) (24, 12) (24, 16) (24, 13) (24, 18) (14, 22) (14, 20) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 8) (20, 16) (20, 14) (18, 24) (18, 27) (18, 13) (27, 9) (27, 3) (27, 6) (27, 18) (27, 13) (13, 3) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 18) (13, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle <5, 9, 29, 0, 5>
        - Cycle <1, 3, 25, 10, 1>
        - Cycle <10, 11, 21, 6, 27, 3, 10>
        - Cycle <25, 8, 28, 9, 27, 3, 25>
        - Cycle <28, 8, 25, 10, 11, 21, 6, 27, 18, 24, 12, 26, 15, 2, 7, 20, 14, 22, 4, 0, 9, 28>
        
Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
        - Cycle <5, 9, 29, 0, 5> has 1 chord: (9, 0)
        - Cycle <1, 3, 25, 10, 1> has 1 chord: (3, 10)
        - Cycle <10, 11, 21, 6, 27, 3, 10> has 1 chord: (11, 6)
        - Cycle <25, 8, 28, 9, 27, 3, 25> has 1 chord: (8, 9)
        - Cycle <28, 8, 25, 10, 11, 21, 6, 27, 18, 24, 12, 26, 15, 2, 7, 20, 14, 22, 4, 0, 9, 28> has 1 chord: (9, 18)

Step 3: Number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <5, (9, 0), 29, 0> <1, (3, 10), 25, 10> <10, (11, 6), 21, 6> <25, (8, 9), 28, 9> <28, (9, 18), 25, 10>
