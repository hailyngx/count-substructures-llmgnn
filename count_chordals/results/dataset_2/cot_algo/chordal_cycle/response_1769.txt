Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
1. (5, 9, 1, 4)
2. (5, 9, 2, 8)
3. (5, 9, 0, 6)
4. (5, 7, 4, 8)
5. (5, 7, 3, 1)
6. (9, 1, 4, 7)
7. (9, 1, 2, 3)
8. (9, 0, 6, 4)
9. (4, 7, 3, 1)
10. (4, 8, 2, 9)
11. (4, 1, 9, 0)
12. (4, 6, 0, 8)
13. (7, 5, 9, 1)
14. (7, 4, 1, 9)
15. (7, 3, 1, 2)
16. (7, 6, 4, 8)
17. (1, 9, 2, 8)
18. (1, 4, 7, 3)
19. (1, 3, 7, 5)
20. (1, 2, 8, 5)
21. (3, 7, 4, 6)
22. (3, 1, 2, 8)
23. (3, 0, 9, 1)
24. (3, 2, 8, 5)
25. (8, 5, 7, 3)
26. (8, 4, 6, 0)
27. (8, 2, 9, 1)
28. (8, 0, 6, 4)
29. (6, 4, 1, 9)
30. (6, 7, 3, 1)
31. (6, 2, 8, 5)
32. (6, 0, 9, 1)
33. (2, 9, 1, 4)
34. (2, 1, 4, 7)
35. (2, 3, 7, 5)
36. (2, 8, 5, 7)
37. (2, 6, 4, 8)
38. (0, 9, 1, 4)
39. (0, 3, 7, 5)
40. (0, 8, 2, 9)
41. (0, 6, 4, 1)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
1. <1, (9, 4), 7>
2. <2, (8, 9), 1>
3. <0, (9, 6), 5>

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles is [0].
