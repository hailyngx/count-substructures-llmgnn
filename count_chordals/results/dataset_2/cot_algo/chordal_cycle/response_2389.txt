Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 15) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 5) (10, 2) (10, 16) (10, 14) (17, 19) (17, 11) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 19) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 10) (2, 18) (2, 11) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 19) (15, 1) (15, 13) (9, 8) (9, 16) (9, 13) (9, 19) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 5) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 9) (19, 7) (12, 14) (12, 11) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 12) (16, 10) (16, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:

<0, 2, 10, 14>  
<0, 2, 11, 18>  
<0, 8, 9, 13>  
<2, 10, 14, 19>  
<2, 11, 17, 19>  
<2, 18, 7, 19>  
<4, 17, 19, 14>  
<6, 3, 5, 7>  
<6, 8, 9, 13>  
<9, 8, 0, 11>  
<9, 13, 15, 1>  
<10, 2, 18, 11>  
<10, 14, 19, 17>  
<11, 0, 8, 6>  
<11, 12, 14, 19>  
<13, 15, 1, 3>  
<17, 19, 14, 12>  
<18, 7, 5, 3>  

Step 2: Checking for a chord in each cycle:

- Chord found in <0, 2, 10, 14>: (2, 14)
- Chord found in <0, 2, 11, 18>: (2, 11)
- Chord found in <2, 10, 14, 19>: (10, 14)
- Chord found in <2, 11, 17, 19>: (11, 17)
- Chord found in <6, 3, 5, 7>: (3, 7)
- Chord found in <9, 13, 15, 1>: (13, 15)
- Chord found in <10, 14, 19, 17>: (14, 17)
- Chord found in <11, 12, 14, 19>: (12, 14)

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles = 18 - 8 = [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 2, 10, 14>
- <0, 2, 11, 18>
- <2, 10, 14, 19>
- <2, 11, 17, 19>
- <6, 3, 5, 7>
- <9, 13, 15, 1>
- <10, 14, 19, 17>
- <11, 12, 14, 19>
