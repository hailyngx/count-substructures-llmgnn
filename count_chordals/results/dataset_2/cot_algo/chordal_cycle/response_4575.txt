Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-2-1-8-4-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-7-6-0-5
- Cycle 3: 5-4-2-9-7-5
- Cycle 4: 5-8-2-9-6-5
- Cycle 5: 9-2-4-8-7-9
- Cycle 6: 9-7-8-5-4-9
- Cycle 7: 6-9-2-4-8-6
- Cycle 8: 6-7-8-5-9-6
- Cycle 9: 1-2-9-7-6-1
- Cycle 10: 3-5-4-8-2-3
- Cycle 11: 3-0-9-2-8-3
- Cycle 12: 3-4-2-8-7-3
- Cycle 13: 4-8-7-6-0-4

Step 2:
Chordal cycles (cycles with exactly one chord):
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (5, 8), 4, (9, 7), 6, (2, 9), 5>
- Chordal cycle 2: <2, (9, 7), 5, (8, 4), 2>
- Chordal cycle 3: <3, (9, 2), 8, (4, 8), 3>
- Chordal cycle 4: <4, (8, 7), 5, (4, 5), 8>

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [9]
