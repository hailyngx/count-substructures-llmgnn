Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 5 - 4 - 9 - 6
- Cycle 2: 9 - 7 - 4 - 1 - 9
- Cycle 3: 9 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 4: 7 - 1 - 3 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 5: 7 - 8 - 5 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 6: 1 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 7: 1 - 5 - 4 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 8: 2 - 9 - 4 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 9: 2 - 1 - 7 - 8 - 2
- Cycle 10: 5 - 8 - 7 - 4 - 5

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 is chordal with a chord (6, 9) <6, 9, 5>
- Cycle 2 is chordal with a chord (4, 7) <9, 4, 1>
- Cycle 3 is chordal with a chord (1, 9) <9, 1, 2>
- Cycle 4 is chordal with a chord (7, 1) <7, 1, 3>
- Cycle 5 is chordal with a chord (5, 8) <7, 8, 5>
- Cycle 6 is chordless
- Cycle 7 is chordal with a chord (5, 9) <1, 5, 4>
- Cycle 8 is chordal with a chord (4, 7) <2, 4, 7>
- Cycle 9 is chordal with a chord (2, 7) <2, 7, 8>
- Cycle 10 is chordal with a chord (4, 7) <5, 4, 8>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: 
- There is 1 chordless cycle found.

Putting the final number inside brackets: [1]
