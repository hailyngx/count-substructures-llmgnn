Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 28) (17, 5) (15, 20) (15, 19) (15, 14) (20, 15) (20, 18) (20, 5) (29, 16) (29, 3) (7, 11) (12, 2) (12, 5) (24, 26) (24, 18) (26, 24) (4, 27) (4, 22) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 21) (27, 4) (27, 22) (27, 6) (1, 28) (1, 13) (3, 29) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 18) (8, 9) (8, 22) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 21) (9, 28) (9, 14) (21, 4) (21, 9) (5, 17) (5, 20) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 25) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 25) (19, 28) (22, 4) (22, 27) (22, 8) (22, 0) (2, 12) (2, 16) (6, 4) (6, 27) (6, 3) (14, 15) (14, 9) (16, 10) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 2) (18, 20) (18, 24) (18, 11) (18, 13) (23, 25) (28, 17) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 19) (28, 25) (0, 11) (0, 22) (25, 5) (25, 19) (25, 23) (25, 28) (13, 1) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
From the given list of edges, we can identify the following cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 10-17-16-29-10
- Cycle 2: 15-20-18-24-26-15
- Cycle 3: 11-7-4-27-22-8-9-14-11
- Cycle 4: 5-17-28-1-13-18-11-3-5
- Cycle 5: 5-20-15-19-5
- Cycle 6: 3-29-16-2-12-5-19-28-3
- Cycle 7: 25-5-20-18-13-25
- Cycle 8: 28-17-5-12-2-16-10-17-28

Step 2:
Checking for each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (16, 29)
- Cycle 2 does not have a chord
- Cycle 3 does not have a chord
- Cycle 4 does not have a chord
- Cycle 5 does not have a chord
- Cycle 6 does not have a chord
- Cycle 7 does not have a chord
- Cycle 8 does not have a chord

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final answer is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <10, 17, 16, 29>  (Chord: (16, 29))
- <15, 20, 18, 24>  (Chordless)
- <11, 7, 4, 27>  (Chordless)
- <5, 17, 28, 1>  (Chordless)
