Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 7, 1, 3, 9)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 7, 9, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 1, 6, 4, 7)
- Cycle 5: (1, 3, 9, 5, 1)
- Cycle 6: (3, 4, 8, 5, 3)
- Cycle 7: (6, 1, 2, 7, 6)
- Cycle 8: (8, 4, 0, 5, 8)
- Cycle 9: (0, 4, 6, 1, 0)
- Cycle 10: (2, 7, 9, 5, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (9, 2)
- Cycle 2 has chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 3 has chord (8, 9)
- Cycle 4 has chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 5 has chord (3, 5)
- Cycle 6 has chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 7 has chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 8 has chord (4, 5)
- Cycle 9 has chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 10 has chord (7, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, 9, 7, 2, 5> with chord (9, 2)
- <9, 7, 1, 3, 9> with chord (7, 3)
- <4, 8, 7, 9, 4> with chord (8, 9)
- <7, 1, 6, 4, 7> with chord (1, 4)
- <1, 3, 9, 5, 1> with chord (3, 5)
- <3, 4, 8, 5, 3> with chord (4, 8)
- <6, 1, 2, 7, 6> with chord (1, 7)
- <8, 4, 0, 5, 8> with chord (4, 5)
- <0, 4, 6, 1, 0> with chord (1, 4)
- <2, 7, 9, 5, 2> with chord (7, 9)
