Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-6-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-7-1-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-7-8-5
- Cycle 4: 5-9-1-7-5
- Cycle 5: 5-9-1-8-5
- Cycle 6: 5-4-9-1-5
- Cycle 7: 5-4-9-7-5
- Cycle 8: 5-4-6-2-5
- Cycle 9: 5-4-6-8-5
- Cycle 10: 5-4-3-7-5
- Cycle 11: 5-4-3-8-5
- Cycle 12: 5-7-9-1-5
- Cycle 13: 5-7-9-4-5
- Cycle 14: 5-7-3-4-5
- Cycle 15: 5-7-3-8-5
- Cycle 16: 5-2-6-4-5
- Cycle 17: 5-2-6-8-5
- Cycle 18: 5-2-8-7-5
- Cycle 19: 5-2-8-1-5

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (8, 7), 5>
- <2, (8, 6), 5>
- <3, (4, 7), 5>
- <4, (1, 9), 5>
- <6, (9, 7), 5>

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
