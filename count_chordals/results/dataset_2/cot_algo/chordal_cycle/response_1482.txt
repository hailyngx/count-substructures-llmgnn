Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 15) (0, 29) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 2) (7, 21) (7, 19) (21, 7) (21, 6) (21, 9) (18, 27) (18, 9) (18, 20) (22, 19) (22, 6) (22, 3) (1, 26) (1, 29) (1, 5) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 17) (2, 27) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 23) (24, 26) (24, 3) (24, 12) (24, 13) (4, 27) (4, 2) (4, 16) (4, 3) (10, 8) (10, 13) (15, 0) (15, 19) (15, 14) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 23) (19, 7) (19, 22) (19, 15) (19, 5) (9, 21) (9, 18) (9, 8) (9, 20) (6, 21) (6, 22) (6, 29) (6, 23) (17, 26) (17, 8) (17, 16) (29, 0) (29, 1) (29, 6) (23, 28) (23, 5) (23, 6) (23, 25) (23, 12) (3, 22) (3, 24) (3, 4) (14, 2) (14, 15) (14, 20) (16, 4) (16, 17) (20, 18) (20, 9) (20, 14) (12, 28) (12, 24) (12, 23) (13, 24) (13, 10) (25, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 15, 19, 5)
- Cycle 2: (0, 15, 19, 22)
- Cycle 3: (0, 15, 19, 7)
- Cycle 4: (0, 15, 14, 2)
- Cycle 5: (0, 15, 14, 20)
- Cycle 6: (0, 29, 1, 5)
- Cycle 7: (0, 29, 1, 26)
- Cycle 8: (0, 29, 6, 23)
- Cycle 9: (27, 4, 2, 8)
- Cycle 10: (27, 4, 3, 24)
- Cycle 11: (27, 2, 8, 10)
- Cycle 12: (27, 2, 14, 20)
- Cycle 13: (27, 18, 20, 14)
- Cycle 14: (27, 18, 20, 9)
- Cycle 15: (27, 18, 9, 8)
- Cycle 16: (27, 18, 9, 21)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 15, 19, 5> (chord: (15, 19))
- <0, 15, 19, 22> (chord: (15, 19))
- <0, 15, 19, 7> (chord: (15, 19))
- <0, 15, 14, 2> (chord: (14, 15))
- <0, 15, 14, 20> (chord: (14, 15))
- <0, 29, 1, 5> (chord: (29, 1))
- <0, 29, 1, 26> (chord: (29, 1))
- <0, 29, 6, 23> (chord: (29, 6))
- <27, 4, 2, 8> (chord: (4, 2))
- <27, 4, 3, 24> (chord: (4, 3))
- <27, 2, 8, 10> (chord: (2, 8))
- <27, 2, 14, 20> (chord: (2, 14))
- <27, 18, 20, 14> (chord: (18, 20))
- <27, 18, 20, 9> (chord: (18, 20))
- <27, 18, 9, 8> (chord: (18, 9))
- <27, 18, 9, 21> (chord: (18, 9))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [16].
