Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (5, 14) (5, 1) (5, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 13) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 10) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 2, 8, 6)
- Cycle 2: (0, 3, 12, 6)
- Cycle 3: (0, 3, 13, 1)
- Cycle 4: (0, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 5: (1, 5, 10, 12)
- Cycle 6: (1, 5, 14, 9)
- Cycle 7: (2, 4, 7, 6)
- Cycle 8: (2, 8, 10, 12)
- Cycle 9: (3, 12, 6, 8)
- Cycle 10: (3, 12, 10, 8)
- Cycle 11: (3, 13, 1, 5)
- Cycle 12: (4, 7, 6, 14)
- Cycle 13: (5, 10, 12, 3)
- Cycle 14: (5, 14, 9, 1)
- Cycle 15: (6, 7, 4, 0)
- Cycle 16: (6, 8, 10, 12)
- Cycle 17: (8, 10, 12, 6)
- Cycle 18: (8, 14, 5, 1)
- Cycle 19: (9, 14, 5, 1)
- Cycle 20: (10, 12, 3, 0)
- Cycle 21: (12, 10, 8, 6)
- Cycle 22: (12, 10, 5, 14)
- Cycle 23: (12, 10, 8, 14)
- Cycle 24: (13, 1, 5, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycles 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 21 have exactly one chord. 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [17]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, (2, 8), 6>
- <0, (3, 12), 6>
- <0, (3, 13), 1>
- <4, (7, 6), 14>
- <5, (10, 12), 3>
- <6, (7, 4), 0>
- <8, (10, 12), 6>
- <9, (14, 5), 1>
- <8, (14, 5), 1>
- <3, (1, 5), 14>
- <12, (10, 5), 14>
- <12, (10, 8), 6>
- <12, (10, 8), 14>
- <0, (13, 1), 5>
- <2, (4, 7), 6>
- <3, (12, 6), 8>
- <8, (14, 5), 1>
