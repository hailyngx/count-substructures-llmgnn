Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 17) (5, 0) (9, 13) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 16) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 14) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 4) (10, 2) (17, 5) (17, 10) (17, 16) (4, 6) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 2) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 14) (12, 4) (12, 16) (12, 3) (7, 18) (7, 14) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 13) (0, 15) (3, 12) (11, 19) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 15) (14, 19) (14, 7) (1, 18) (1, 16) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (4, 6, 0, 5, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 6, 0, 15, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 6, 0, 13, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 6, 2, 15, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 6, 2, 10, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 6, 2, 15, 0, 5, 17, 16, 4)  (Not a simple cycle but included for completeness)
- Cycle 7: (4, 10, 2, 6, 0, 5, 17, 10, 4)  (Not a simple cycle but included for completeness)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <1, (0, 5), 4> with chord (0, 5) for Cycle 1
- <2, (4, 6), 3> with chord (4, 6) for Cycle 2
- <4, (0, 15), 2> with chord (0, 15) for Cycle 3
- <5, (0, 13), 1> with chord (0, 13) for Cycle 4
- <6, (2, 15), 0> with chord (2, 15) for Cycle 5

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found.

Final result: [5]
