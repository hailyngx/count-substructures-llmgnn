Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 12) (1, 27) (21, 28) (21, 6) (21, 4) (6, 1) (6, 21) (6, 7) (9, 10) (0, 14) (0, 29) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 22) (14, 12) (14, 15) (17, 29) (17, 16) (17, 26) (17, 8) (17, 11) (29, 0) (29, 17) (4, 21) (4, 13) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 24) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 25) (24, 18) (24, 26) (24, 22) (26, 17) (26, 24) (26, 10) (26, 3) (7, 6) (7, 28) (7, 23) (25, 28) (25, 15) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 16) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 22) (10, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 16) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 12) (16, 23) (16, 27) (15, 14) (15, 18) (15, 25) (22, 14) (22, 24) (22, 10) (8, 17) (8, 20) (20, 8) (20, 27) (2, 0) (2, 13) (23, 7) (23, 16) (23, 3) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 11) (27, 1) (27, 16) (27, 20) (27, 5) (11, 17) (11, 13) (11, 5) (5, 10) (5, 27) (5, 11) (3, 26) (3, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 7, 23)
- Cycle 2: (1, 27, 20, 8)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 21, 28)
- Cycle 4: (1, 19, 18, 24)
- Cycle 5: (14, 0, 2, 13)
- Cycle 6: (17, 29, 0, 14)
- Cycle 7: (17, 16, 12, 1)
- Cycle 8: (17, 26, 3, 23)
- Cycle 9: (21, 28, 25, 15)
- Cycle 10: (26, 17, 8, 20)
- Cycle 11: (26, 10, 22, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (6, 21), 28>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (19, 18), 24>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <17, (16, 12), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <21, (28, 25), 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <26, (10, 22), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.  

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
