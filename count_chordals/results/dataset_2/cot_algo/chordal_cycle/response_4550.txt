Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 18) (6, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 4) (3, 8) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 17) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 15) (13, 11) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 11) (17, 12) (10, 15) (10, 1) (15, 8) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 16) (16, 0) (16, 15) (16, 2) (16, 19) (7, 9) (7, 1) (19, 11) (19, 13) (19, 16) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 17) (18, 6) (18, 13) (18, 1) (1, 5) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 18) (2, 15) (2, 16) 

Response:
Step 1:  List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 8 - 15 - 16 
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 8 - 11 - 17 
- Cycle 3: 5 - 1 - 14 - 0 - 12 
- Cycle 4: 9 - 8 - 11 - 17 - 12 
- Cycle 5: 9 - 8 - 15 - 16 - 2 
- Cycle 6: 9 - 8 - 3 - 11 - 17 
- Cycle 7: 6 - 18 - 13 - 11 - 8 
- Cycle 8: 6 - 4 - 0 - 12 - 17 
- Cycle 9: 6 - 4 - 14 - 1 - 5 
- Cycle 10: 0 - 14 - 1 - 5 - 12 
- Cycle 11: 0 - 14 - 4 - 6 - 18 
- Cycle 12: 0 - 16 - 15 - 8 - 9 
- Cycle 13: 0 - 16 - 19 - 13 - 11 
- Cycle 14: 11 - 13 - 18 - 6 - 4 
- Cycle 15: 11 - 17 - 12 - 0 - 16 
- Cycle 16: 15 - 8 - 9 - 7 - 1 
- Cycle 17: 15 - 8 - 3 - 11 - 19 
- Cycle 18: 15 - 16 - 19 - 13 - 18 
- Cycle 19: 16 - 15 - 10 - 1 - 5 
- Cycle 20: 16 - 2 - 15 - 8 - 3 

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- No chords in Cycle 1
- No chords in Cycle 2
- <Cycle 3, (1, 14)>
- <Cycle 4, (8, 17)>
- <Cycle 5, (8, 15)>
- No chords in Cycle 6
- No chords in Cycle 7
- No chords in Cycle 8
- No chords in Cycle 9
- <Cycle 10, (1, 5)>
- No chords in Cycle 11
- No chords in Cycle 12
- No chords in Cycle 13
- No chords in Cycle 14
- No chords in Cycle 15
- <Cycle 16, (9, 7)>
- No chords in Cycle 17
- No chords in Cycle 18
- No chords in Cycle 19
- No chords in Cycle 20

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count is [4].
