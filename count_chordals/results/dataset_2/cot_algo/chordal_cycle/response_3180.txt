Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (27, 28) (27, 9) (27, 26) (27, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (21, 20) (21, 22) (21, 17) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 29) (11, 20) (8, 1) (8, 23) (8, 26) (23, 8) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 25) (26, 27) (26, 8) (26, 19) (26, 16) (22, 21) (22, 4) (28, 27) (28, 11) (28, 16) (28, 24) (5, 24) (13, 27) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 18) (16, 26) (16, 28) (16, 6) (18, 19) (18, 13) (18, 6) (7, 3) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 9) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 25) (0, 10) (0, 17) (3, 7) (3, 24) (3, 9) (6, 16) (6, 18) (6, 7) (6, 2) (17, 21) (17, 0) (17, 2) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 24) (20, 21) (20, 11) (20, 7) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 3) (24, 14) (24, 2) (2, 19) (2, 6) (2, 17) (2, 24) (25, 19) (25, 4) (25, 12) (12, 14) (12, 25) (29, 11) (9, 27) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (1, 9, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 9, 7, 6, 2, 17, 0, 10, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 9, 7, 20, 11, 10, 0, 17, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 23, 2, 6, 7, 9, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 8, 26, 27, 13, 11, 20, 21, 22, 4, 13, 18, 19, 2, 6, 7, 3, 9, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 8, 26, 16, 6, 7, 9, 27, 13, 4, 22, 21, 20, 11, 10, 0, 17, 2, 24, 5, 24, 3, 7, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 8, 26, 16, 28, 27, 13, 4, 22, 21, 20, 7, 6, 2, 17, 0, 10, 11, 28, 24, 5, 24, 3, 9, 1)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: No chord
- Cycle 2: Chord: (2, 17)
- Cycle 3: Chord: (11, 20)
- Cycle 4: No chord
- Cycle 5: No chord
- Cycle 6: Chord: (16, 28)
- Cycle 7: Chord: (20, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 9, 3, 7, (2, 17)>
- <1, 9, 7, 20, 11, 10, 0, 17, 1>
- <1, 8, 26, 16, 28, 27, 13, 4, 22, 21, 20, 7, 6, 2, 17, 0, 10, 11, 28, 24, 5, 3, 9>
