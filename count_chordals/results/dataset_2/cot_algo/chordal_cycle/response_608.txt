Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 12) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 11) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 1) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 1) (10, 9) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 13) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 6, 7, 4>  
- Cycle 2: <1, 6, 7, 11, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 6, 7, 8, 5>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 12, 11, 7>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 14, 2, 10>
- Cycle 6: <2, 6, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 12, 14, 11>
- Cycle 8: <2, 6, 14, 12, 11>
- Cycle 9: <2, 6, 1, 10, 8>
- Cycle 10: <3, 4, 7, 11, 0>
- Cycle 11: <3, 4, 5, 8, 10>
- Cycle 12: <3, 4, 5, 8, 7>
- Cycle 13: <3, 5, 8, 7, 6>
- Cycle 14: <3, 5, 11, 7, 4>
- Cycle 15: <1, 6, 2, 10, 8, 7>
- Cycle 16: <1, 6, 7, 4, 5, 8>
- Cycle 17: <1, 6, 7, 8, 5, 4>
- Cycle 18: <2, 6, 7, 4, 5, 8>
- Cycle 19: <2, 6, 14, 12, 11, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 6, 7, 8, 5> has a chord (6, 8)
- <1, 6, 12, 11, 7> has a chord (6, 11)
- <2, 6, 14, 12, 11> has a chord (14, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
- We found 16 chordless cycles

Therefore, the final answer is: [16]
