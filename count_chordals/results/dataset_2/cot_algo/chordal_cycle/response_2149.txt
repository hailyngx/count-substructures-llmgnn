Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        
- Cycle <5, 2, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle <9, 8, 4, 7, 9>
- Cycle <1, 7, 4, 6, 1>
- Cycle <3, 1, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle <10, 12, 1, 7, 10>
- Cycle <11, 0, 9, 8, 11>
- Cycle <8, 5, 14, 10, 8>
- Cycle <6, 4, 2, 11, 6>
- Cycle <0, 9, 13, 2, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle <5, 2, 4, 7, 5> has a chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle <9, 8, 4, 7, 9> has a chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle <1, 7, 4, 6, 1> has a chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle <3, 1, 7, 4, 3> has a chord: (3, 7)
- Cycle <10, 12, 1, 7, 10> has a chord: (10, 7)
- Cycle <11, 0, 9, 8, 11> has a chord: (11, 9)
- Cycle <8, 5, 14, 10, 8> has a chord: (8, 14)
- Cycle <6, 4, 2, 11, 6> has a chord: (6, 2)
- Cycle <0, 9, 13, 2, 0> has a chord: (0, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
[9]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, (5, 7), 2>
- <9, (9, 4), 8>
- <1, (1, 4), 7>
- <3, (3, 7), 1>
- <10, (10, 7), 12>
- <11, (11, 9), 0>
- <8, (8, 14), 5>
- <6, (6, 2), 4>
- <0, (0, 13), 9>
