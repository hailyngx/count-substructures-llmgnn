Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
1. (4, 8, 9, 3)
2. (4, 8, 7, 6)
3. (4, 8, 7, 2)
4. (4, 8, 0, 1)
5. (4, 8, 0, 6)
6. (4, 8, 1, 6)
7. (4, 0, 1, 6)
8. (4, 0, 6, 7)
9. (4, 0, 6, 1)
10. (4, 0, 6, 1, 8)
11. (4, 6, 7, 8)
12. (4, 6, 7, 2)
13. (4, 6, 1, 8)
14. (4, 6, 1, 0)
15. (4, 6, 1, 8, 7)
16. (4, 6, 1, 0, 8)
17. (4, 6, 1, 0, 8, 7)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <4, 8, 9, 3>: (4, 8) is the chord.
2. <4, 8, 7, 6>: (4, 8) is the chord.
3. <4, 8, 7, 2>: (4, 8) is the chord.
4. <4, 8, 0, 1>: (0, 1) is the chord.
5. <4, 8, 0, 6>: (0, 6) is the chord.
6. <4, 8, 1, 6>: (1, 6) is the chord.
7. <4, 0, 1, 6>: (0, 1) is the chord.
8. <4, 0, 6, 7>: (6, 7) is the chord.
9. <4, 0, 6, 1>: (0, 1) is the chord.
10. <4, 0, 6, 1, 8>: (0, 8) is the chord.
11. <4, 6, 7, 8>: (7, 8) is the chord.
12. <4, 6, 7, 2>: (6, 7) is the chord.
13. <4, 6, 1, 8>: (1, 8) is the chord.
14. <4, 6, 1, 0>: (0, 1) is the chord.
15. <4, 6, 1, 8, 7>: (1, 7) is the chord.
16. <4, 6, 1, 0, 8>: (1, 8) is the chord.
17. <4, 6, 1, 0, 8, 7>: (1, 7) is the chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [17]
