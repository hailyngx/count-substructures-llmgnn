Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 12) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (13, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 9) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 3) (11, 1) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (12, 10) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 11) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 12) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-7-8-14-3-2-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-7-8-14-11-2-5-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-8-14-11-3-2-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-5-2-11-14-8-7-1
- Cycle 5: 1-5-2-11-14-3-9-0-1
- Cycle 6: 1-5-2-6-4-13-1
- Cycle 7: 1-5-2-6-12-10-1
- Cycle 8: 1-5-2-10-12-6-4-13-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 7, 8, 14, 3, (2, 5), 1>
- <1, 7, 8, 14, 11, (2, 5), 1>
- <1, 7, 8, 14, 11, 3, (2, 5), 1>
- <1, 5, 2, 11, (14, 8), 7, 1>
- <1, 5, 2, 11, (14, 3), 9, 0, 1>
- <1, 5, 2, 6, (4, 13), 1>
- <1, 5, 2, 6, (12, 10), 1>
- <1, 5, 2, 10, (12, 6), 4, 13, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph. Therefore, the final count is [0].
