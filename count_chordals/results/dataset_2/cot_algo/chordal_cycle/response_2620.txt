Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 13) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 1) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (13, 7) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 1, 12, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 0, 14, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 2, 6, 8, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 4, 10, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 1, 12, 7, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 0, 14, 11, 9)
- Cycle 8: (6, 4, 10, 11, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 10, 11, 8, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 3, 0, 14, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 2, 8, 3, 6)
- Cycle 12: (10, 4, 6, 8, 10)
- Cycle 13: (10, 6, 3, 0, 10)
- Cycle 14: (10, 11, 8, 2, 10)
- Cycle 15: (10, 12, 7, 13, 10)
- Cycle 16: (11, 12, 7, 13, 11)
- Cycle 17: (12, 7, 13, 0, 12)
- Cycle 18: (0, 14, 11, 8, 0)
- Cycle 19: (0, 3, 6, 10, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (9, 0), 12>
- <3, (0, 3), 6>
- <4, (6, 4), 10>
- <5, (9, 5), 2>
- <7, (12, 7), 13>
- <8, (11, 8), 2>
- <11, (10, 11), 8>
- <13, (7, 13), 10>
- <14, (0, 14), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
