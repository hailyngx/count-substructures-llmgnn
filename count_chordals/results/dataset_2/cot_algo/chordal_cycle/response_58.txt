Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 6, 5, 9)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 6, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 4, 3, 7)
- Cycle 6: (4, 3, 6, 4)
- Cycle 7: (3, 6, 2, 3)
- Cycle 8: (6, 2, 9, 6)
- Cycle 9: (9, 7, 4, 9)
- Cycle 10: (3, 4, 2, 3)
- Cycle 11: (4, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 12: (2, 6, 9, 2)
- Cycle 13: (6, 9, 7, 6)
- Cycle 14: (2, 1, 0, 2)
- Cycle 15: (1, 0, 5, 1)
- Cycle 16: (0, 3, 4, 0)
- Cycle 17: (3, 7, 9, 3)
- Cycle 18: (7, 4, 5, 7)
- Cycle 19: (0, 1, 2, 0)
- Cycle 20: (1, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 21: (8, 0, 3, 8)
- Cycle 22: (0, 5, 9, 0)
- Cycle 23: (3, 8, 0, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle:
- <5, (9, 6), 5>
- <7, (4, 6), 7>
- <2, (6, 9), 2>
- <1, (0, 5), 1>
- <0, (3, 4), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

We found 18 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
