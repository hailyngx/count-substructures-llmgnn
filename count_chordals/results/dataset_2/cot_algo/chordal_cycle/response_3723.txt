Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 4-6-9-3-4
- Cycle 2: 4-8-6-9-4
- Cycle 3: 4-3-9-6-4
- Cycle 4: 7-4-6-9-7
- Cycle 5: 3-9-6-4-3
- Cycle 6: 3-5-8-6-3
- Cycle 7: 9-6-4-8-9
- Cycle 8: 9-6-8-5-9

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 2: 4-<8>-6-9-4
- Cycle 5: 3-9-<6>-4-3
- Cycle 6: 3-5-8-<6>-3
- Cycle 8: 9-6-<8>-5-9

Step 3:
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [4].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <4, (8), 6, 9>
- <3, 9, (6), 4>
- <3, 5, 8, (6)>
- <9, 6, (8), 5>
