Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 2) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 7) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 6, 2, 9, 1)
- (1, 6, 2, 12, 13, 1)
- (1, 6, 2, 12, 10, 1)
- (1, 6, 2, 10, 12, 2)
- (1, 6, 2, 10, 12, 13, 1)
- (1, 6, 2, 12, 13, 0, 1)
- (1, 6, 2, 12, 13, 4, 0, 1)
- (1, 6, 2, 12, 10, 1)
- (1, 6, 2, 10, 12, 13, 0, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

After checking the cycles listed above, we find that the cycle <1, 6, 2, 9, 1> has exactly one chord (1, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 6, 2, 9, 1>.
