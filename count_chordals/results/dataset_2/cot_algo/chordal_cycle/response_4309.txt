Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 2) (27, 26) (27, 16) (1, 21) (1, 5) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 25) (4, 29) (8, 10) (8, 25) (8, 17) (8, 3) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 12) (28, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 24) (3, 13) (11, 3) (11, 5) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 22) (0, 25) (16, 27) (16, 0) (16, 18) (6, 29) (6, 12) (6, 26) (29, 4) (29, 6) (29, 14) (19, 12) (19, 9) (14, 28) (14, 29) (14, 23) (22, 0) (24, 3) (24, 17) (24, 20) (24, 25) (20, 24) (20, 26) (26, 27) (26, 6) (26, 20) (26, 7) (23, 15) (23, 1) (23, 14) (23, 13) (2, 27) (2, 13) (9, 19) (18, 10) (18, 16) (18, 12) (17, 8) (17, 0) (17, 24) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 3) (13, 23) (13, 2) (7, 28) (7, 26) (12, 15) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 19) (12, 18) (25, 21) (25, 8) (25, 0) (25, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle: 3-8-10-5-3 (Chords: 8-5)
2. Cycle: 14-29-6-12-14 (Chords: 29-6)
3. Cycle: 16-27-26-20-16 (Chords: 27-20)
4. Cycle: 0-16-27-15-0 (Chords: 16-15)
5. Cycle: 3-24-17-0-3 (Chords: 24-17)
6. Cycle: 21-25-8-3-21 (Chords: 25-8)
7. Cycle: 1-23-14-29-1 (Chords: 23-14)
8. Cycle: 21-1-5-10-21 (Chords: 1-10)
9. Cycle: 27-2-13-23-27 (Chords: 2-13)

Step 3:
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Putting the final number inside brackets, the answer is [0].
