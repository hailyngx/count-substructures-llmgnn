Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 12) (4, 8) (4, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 12) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
   - Cycles of length 4 or more: 
        - <5, 3, 1, 7>
        - <5, 3, 1, 11>
        - <5, 12, 11, 1>
        - <5, 12, 11, 14>
        - <8, 5, 3, 1>
        - <8, 5, 3, 0>
        - <8, 5, 12, 11>
        - <8, 5, 12, 7>
        - <8, 9, 14, 11>
        - <8, 9, 14, 7>
        - <8, 7, 1, 3>
        - <8, 7, 1, 11>
        - <8, 7, 12, 6>
        - <8, 7, 12, 13>
        (Several more cycles exist, but these are examples)

Step 2:
   - Checking for exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycle with chord <5, 14, 7, 12>
        - Chordal 4-cycle with chord <8, 9, 14, 11>
        (Several more could be found, but these are examples)

Step 3:
   - Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0] 

Overall, no chordless 4-cycles were found in this graph.
