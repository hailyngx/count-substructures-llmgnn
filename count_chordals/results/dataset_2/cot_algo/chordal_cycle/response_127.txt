Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 14) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (0, 1) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 2) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 1) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <5, 9, 13, 14>
- <6, 9, 13, 14>
- <8, 6, 9, 13>
- <12, 9, 13, 14>
- <7, 8, 6, 9>
- <4, 12, 9, 13>
- <3, 8, 6, 9>
- <11, 9, 13, 14>
- <0, 6, 9, 13>
- <10, 5, 9, 13>
- <1, 7, 8, 6>
- <2, 6, 9, 13>

Step 2:
Only one of these cycles has exactly one chord, which is <6, 9, 13, 14>. So, we have found 1 chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
[1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <6, 9, 13, 14>
