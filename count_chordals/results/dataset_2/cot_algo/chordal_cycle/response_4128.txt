Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (1, 6) (1, 11) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 14) (10, 12) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 10) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1:  
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph (with existing edges):  
<5, 9, 4, 8>  
<5, 9, 7, 2>  
<5, 13, 0, 3>  
<5, 13, 2, 7>  
<5, 3, 6, 1>  
<5, 3, 13, 2>  
<9, 4, 8, 6>  
<9, 4, 11, 1>  
<9, 10, 3, 0>  
<9, 10, 14, 2>  
<4, 8, 6, 1>  
<4, 8, 10, 3>  
<4, 11, 2, 7>  
<7, 2, 0, 13>  
<8, 6, 1, 11>  
<8, 10, 14, 2>  
<6, 1, 11, 2>  
<13, 0, 2, 7>  
<0, 3, 10, 14>  
<3, 6, 8, 4>  
<3, 10, 14, 2>  
<11, 1, 6, 8>  
<14, 2, 7, 5>  
<10, 12, 9, 4>  

Step 2:  
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one non-adjacent chord:  
<5, 9, (4, 8), 6>  
<5, 9, (7, 2), 13>  
<5, 13, (0, 3), 2>  
<5, 13, (2, 7), 5>  
<5, 3, (6, 1), 11>  
<5, 3, (13, 2), 7>  
<9, 4, (8, 6), 1>  
<9, 4, (11, 1), 7>  
<9, 10, (3, 0), 14>  
<9, 10, (14, 2), 4>  
<4, 8, (6, 1), 11>  
<4, 8, (10, 3), 6>  
<4, 11, (1, 6), 8>  
<8, 6, (1, 11), 2>  
<8, 10, (14, 2), 4>  
<6, 1, (11, 2), 7>  
<13, 0, (2, 7), 5>  
<0, 3, (10, 14), 2>  
<3, 6, (8, 4), 11>  
<11, 1, (6, 8), 4>  
<14, 2, (7, 5), 13>  
<10, 12, (9, 4), 8>  

Step 3:  
Number of chordal 4-cycles with exactly one non-adjacent chord: [22]
