Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 17) (6, 13) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 17) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 18) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 12) (0, 16) (0, 13) (16, 0) (16, 10) (16, 15) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 12) (18, 13) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 18) (12, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 1) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 6) (17, 2) (17, 5) (17, 3) (3, 5) (3, 17) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 16) (10, 8) (10, 16) (10, 18) (10, 14) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 18) (7, 9) (7, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-9-15-16-1
- Cycle 2: 2-8-10-16-2
- Cycle 3: 2-8-15-9-1-7-2
- Cycle 4: 2-13-0-16-10-14-19-12-2
- Cycle 5: 5-17-2-8-15-9-1-11-5
- Cycle 6: 5-17-2-13-18-19-12-11-5
- Cycle 7: 5-17-6-13-0-16-10-14-19-5
- Cycle 8: 5-3-17-6-13-2-12-11-5

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (9, 15), 16)>
- <2, (8, 10), 16)>
- <2, (8, 15), 9)>
- <2, (13, 0), 16)>
- <5, (17, 2), 8)>
- <5, (17, 2), 13)>
- <5, (17, 6), 13)>
- <5, (3, 17), 6)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
