Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 10) (25, 3) (25, 7) (22, 23) (22, 2) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 8) (23, 14) (23, 28) (20, 14) (20, 28) (8, 23) (8, 2) (8, 15) (13, 12) (1, 26) (1, 17) (1, 2) (1, 4) (26, 1) (26, 15) (26, 11) (26, 27) (26, 7) (2, 22) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 21) (17, 1) (17, 27) (17, 15) (0, 22) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 29) (7, 25) (7, 26) (7, 0) (7, 29) (7, 28) (5, 15) (5, 10) (19, 18) (19, 29) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 27) (6, 14) (6, 16) (21, 2) (21, 4) (4, 1) (4, 21) (4, 24) (12, 13) (12, 14) (18, 19) (29, 0) (29, 7) (29, 19) (15, 8) (15, 26) (15, 17) (15, 0) (15, 5) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 6) (14, 12) (16, 2) (16, 6) (27, 26) (27, 17) (27, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 28) (9, 10) (24, 4) (24, 28) (28, 23) (28, 20) (28, 7) (28, 10) (28, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
<2, 1, 26, 7>  
<2, 1, 17, 27>  
<2, 1, 4, 21>  
<2, 1, 17, 15>  
<2, 16, 6, 14>  
<2, 16, 6, 14>  
<2, 16, 6, 14>  
<2, 21, 4, 24>  
<2, 21, 4, 24>  
<2, 21, 4, 24>  
<22, 23, 8, 2>  
<22, 23, 14, 20>  
<22, 23, 14, 6>  
<22, 2, 1, 26>  
<22, 2, 1, 17>  
<22, 0, 7, 25>  
<22, 0, 7, 26>  
<22, 0, 7, 29>  
<23, 22, 2, 8>  
<23, 22, 2, 26>  
<23, 22, 2, 1>  
<23, 14, 20, 28>  
<23, 14, 20, 28>  
<23, 14, 6, 16>  
<23, 28, 20, 14>  
<23, 8, 15, 26>  
<23, 8, 15, 17>  
<23, 8, 2, 1>  
<23, 8, 15, 0>  
<23, 8, 15, 5>  
<20, 14, 23, 22>  
<20, 14, 6, 16>  
<20, 28, 23, 8>  
<8, 23, 22, 2>  
<8, 23, 14, 20>  
<8, 23, 14, 6>  
<8, 2, 1, 26>  
<8, 2, 1, 17>  
<8, 2, 16, 6>  
<8, 15, 26, 7>  
<8, 15, 26, 11>  
<8, 15, 26, 27>  
<13, 12, 14, 6>  
<1, 2, 22, 0>  
<1, 2, 22, 23>  
<1, 2, 8, 15>  
<1, 26, 7, 29>  
<1, 26, 15, 8>  
<1, 26, 15, 0>  
<1, 26, 15, 5>  
<1, 17, 27, 11>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<2, 1, (17), 27>  
<2, 16, (6), 14>  
<22, 23, (8), 2>  
<22, 23, (14), 20>  
<22, 0, (7), 25>  
<23, 22, (2), 8>  
<23, 14, (20), 28>  
<23, 14, (6), 16>  
<8, 23, (14), 20>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<2, 1, 26, 7>
