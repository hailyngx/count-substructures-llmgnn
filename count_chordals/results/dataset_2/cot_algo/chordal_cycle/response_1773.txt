Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 14) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 19) (7, 5) (7, 17) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (10, 19) (10, 14) (17, 7) (17, 13) (17, 18) (17, 11) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 11) (6, 13) (2, 16) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 12) (19, 7) (19, 10) (19, 5) (13, 3) (13, 17) (13, 6) (13, 16) (0, 2) (0, 18) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 13) (16, 9) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 15) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (9, 16) (9, 14) (18, 17) (18, 0) (18, 12) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (3, 1, 4, 7) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (3, 1, 5, 7) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (7, 4, 1, 3) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (7, 1, 5, 11) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (1, 3, 15, 14) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (17, 7, 4, 1) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (17, 7, 19, 10) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (5, 1, 3, 13) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (5, 7, 4, 16) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (2, 16, 4, 1) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (15, 3, 8, 12) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (14, 15, 3, 1) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (14, 15, 4, 16) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (14, 10, 19, 7) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (14, 10, 11, 5) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (14, 11, 17, 7) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (14, 12, 8, 3) - This is a cycle of length 4.
- (14, 12, 18, 0) - This is a cycle of length 4.

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- <(3, 1, 4, 7), (3, 7)>
- <(3, 1, 5, 7), (1, 7)>
- <(5, 1, 3, 13), (1, 3)>
- <(14, 15, 4, 16), (15, 4)>
- <(14, 10, 11, 5), (10, 5)>
- <(14, 12, 8, 3), (12, 8)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [6]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <(3, 1, 4, 7), (3, 7)>
- <(3, 1, 5, 7), (1, 7)>
- <(5, 1, 3, 13), (1, 3)>
- <(14, 15, 4, 16), (15, 4)>
- <(14, 10, 11, 5), (10, 5)>
- <(14, 12, 8, 3), (12, 8)>
