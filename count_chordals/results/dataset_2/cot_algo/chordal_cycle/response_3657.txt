Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 9) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (5, 1) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 14) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 9) (10, 1) (10, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:

- Cycle 3: 1-4-11-7-1
- Cycle 4: 1-10-2-13-1
- Cycle 5: 3-11-1-5-3
- Cycle 6: 3-7-12-5-3
- Cycle 7: 3-6-8-9-3
- Cycle 8: 3-13-2-11-3
- Cycle 9: 7-12-5-13-7
- Cycle 10: 7-3-11-9-7
- Cycle 11: 7-9-8-6-7
- Cycle 12: 12-7-3-11-12
- Cycle 13: 12-5-1-4-12
- Cycle 14: 12-14-8-6-12
- Cycle 15: 11-3-7-9-11
- Cycle 16: 11-5-1-4-11
- Cycle 17: 11-4-9-0-11
- Cycle 18: 11-2-13-5-11
- Cycle 19: 5-1-4-9-5
- Cycle 20: 5-12-7-3-5
- Cycle 21: 5-11-3-13-5
- Cycle 22: 5-13-2-10-5
- Cycle 23: 13-3-11-9-13
- Cycle 24: 13-5-12-7-13
- Cycle 25: 13-2-10-1-13
- Cycle 26: 8-3-11-2-8
- Cycle 27: 8-9-7-12-8
- Cycle 28: 8-14-12-5-8
- Cycle 29: 8-6-3-7-8
- Cycle 30: 9-7-12-14-9
- Cycle 31: 9-11-4-6-9
- Cycle 32: 9-8-14-6-9
- Cycle 33: 9-4-1-10-9
- Cycle 34: 0-1-4-9-0
- Cycle 35: 10-1-5-14-10
- Cycle 36: 10-2-13-3-10
- Cycle 37: 6-3-11-9-6
- Cycle 38: 6-8-14-12-6
- Cycle 39: 6-14-5-1-6
- Cycle 40: 6-4-9-7-6
- Cycle 41: 14-12-7-9-14
- Cycle 42: 14-5-1-10-14
- Cycle 43: 14-8-9-11-14
- Cycle 44: 14-6-4-1-14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
- <1, (10, 2), 13)>
- <3, (6, 8), 9)>
- <7, (9, 11), 4)>
- <12, (5, 1), 4)>
- <11, (2, 13), 5)>
- <5, (13, 2), 10)>
- <13, (3, 11), 9)>
- <8, (3, 11), 2)>
- <9, (7, 12), 8)>
- <0, (1, 4), 9)>
- <10, (2, 13), 3)>
- <6, (3, 11), 9)>
- <14, (5, 1), 10)>
- <4, (9, 7), 6)>
- <2, (11, 5), 13)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 14 chordal 4-cycles in the graph. Therefore, the final count is [14].
