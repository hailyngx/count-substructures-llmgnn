Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are two cycles of length 4 in the graph:
    - Cycle 1: (5, 6, 7, 8, 5)
    - Cycle 2: (3, 4, 8, 7, 3)

Step 2:
- Checking for a single chord in each cycle:
    - Cycle 1 has a chord (8, 6) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 7) making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
- The number of chordless 4-cycles is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
- <1, (8, 6), 5>
- <2, (4, 7), 3>
