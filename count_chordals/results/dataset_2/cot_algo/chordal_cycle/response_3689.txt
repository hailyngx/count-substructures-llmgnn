Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 10) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 5) (3, 13) (3, 11) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 9) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 9) (10, 14) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 9) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 14) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (2, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 14) (9, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 8 - 13 - 2 - 4 - 12 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 8 - 6 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 8 - 6 - 11 - 5 - 4 - 12 - 0

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has two chords: (9, 1)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, 8, 6, 7> with no chord
<0, 8, 6, 11, 5, 4, 12, 0> with 1 chord (9, 1)
