Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 18) (4, 13) (4, 17) (7, 11) (7, 18) (3, 5) (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 10) (8, 16) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 7) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 4) (17, 3) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 2) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 2) (6, 15) (6, 1) (14, 15) (14, 1) (14, 12) (18, 9) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (2, 15) (2, 13) (2, 17) (2, 0) (19, 3) (19, 0) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 18) (16, 5) (16, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 18 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 3 - 15 - 14 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 3 - 17 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 1 - 6 - 15 - 5
- Cycle 5: 5 - 16 - 8 - 10 - 5
- Cycle 6: 9 - 18 - 7 - 11 - 9
- Cycle 7: 4 - 13 - 2 - 17 - 4
- Cycle 8: 7 - 11 - 18 - 3 - 7
- Cycle 9: 7 - 18 - 15 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 10: 3 - 15 - 14 - 12 - 3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 3: 5 - 3 - 17 - 4 - 5 has exactly one chord (3, 4).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 0 chordless 4-cycle <found in the graph>.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
