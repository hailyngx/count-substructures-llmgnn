This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 12) (4, 19) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 10) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 10) (1, 12) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 19) (3, 13) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 15) (15, 9) (15, 1) (15, 11) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 1) (19, 4) (19, 17) (19, 16) (7, 9) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 19) (16, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (9, 11, 2, 8, 13, 17, 16, 5, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 11, 2, 13, 3, 13, 17, 1, 15, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 14, 0, 10, 1, 15, 11, 14, 9)
- Cycle 4: (8, 2, 13, 3, 13, 17, 1, 15, 11, 2, 8)
- Cycle 5: (8, 12, 4, 19, 17, 13, 2, 11, 15, 1, 10, 0, 12, 8)
- Cycle 6: (8, 12, 0, 10, 1, 17, 13, 2, 11, 15, 9, 14, 11, 2, 8)
- Cycle 7: (8, 10, 0, 12, 4, 19, 16, 17, 1, 15, 9, 11, 2, 8)
- Cycle 8: (13, 17, 16, 5, 9, 11, 2, 8, 12, 0, 14, 9, 15, 1, 10, 8)
- Cycle 9: (13, 17, 19, 4, 12, 8, 2, 11, 15, 1, 10, 0, 14, 9, 11, 13)
- Cycle 10: (13, 2, 8, 12, 0, 14, 9, 11, 2, 13)
- Cycle 11: (13, 2, 11, 15, 1, 17, 16, 5, 9, 14, 11, 13)
- Cycle 12: (4, 12, 0, 14, 9, 11, 2, 13, 17, 16, 19, 4)
- Cycle 13: (0, 10, 1, 17, 13, 2, 11, 9, 14, 0)
- Cycle 14: (0, 12, 4, 19, 17, 13, 2, 11, 15, 1, 10, 0)
- Cycle 15: (14, 9, 11, 2, 13, 17, 16, 5, 16, 17, 13, 14)
- Cycle 16: (2, 8, 12, 4, 19, 17, 16, 5, 9, 14, 0, 10, 1, 15, 11, 2)
- Cycle 17: (1, 17, 13, 2, 11, 15, 1) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Checking cycle 1 for chord: (9, 2) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 2 for chord: (9, 13) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 3 for chord: (14, 0) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 4 for chord: (8, 13) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 5 for chord: (8, 11) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 6 for chord: (8, 1) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 7 for chord: (8, 14) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 8 for chord: (13, 5) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 9 for chord: (13, 11) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 10 for chord: (13, 8) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 11 for chord: (13, 5) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 12 for chord: (12, 9) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 13 for chord: (0, 14) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 14 for chord: (0, 10) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 15 for chord: (9, 17) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 16 for chord: (8, 4) is a chord.
- Checking cycle 17 for chord: (1, 2) is a chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

Unique Chordal 4-Cycles:
<1, (9, 2)>
<2, (9, 13)>
<3, (14, 0)>
<4, (8, 13)>
<5, (8, 11)>
<6, (8, 1)>
<7, (8, 14)>
<8, (13, 5)>
