Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 2) (16, 5) (16, 6) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 5) (12, 5) (12, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 14) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (1, 17) (1, 6) (1, 14) (17, 11) (17, 1) (17, 13) (5, 16) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 10) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 15) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 9) (13, 14) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 9) (6, 16) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 19) (0, 6) (0, 10) (10, 5) (10, 0) (18, 11) (18, 3) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 18) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: {11, 2, 8, 9} (Chordless)
- Cycle 2: {11, 2, 19, 0} (Chordless)
- Cycle 3: {11, 2, 14, 1} (Chordless)
- Cycle 4: {11, 2, 8, 3} (Chordless)
- Cycle 5: {11, 17, 1, 14} (Chordless)
- Cycle 6: {11, 17, 13, 9} (Chordless)
- Cycle 7: {11, 17, 1, 6} (Chordless)
- Cycle 8: {11, 19, 0, 6} (Chordless)
- Cycle 9: {11, 19, 2, 14} (Chordless)
- Cycle 10: {11, 19, 2, 8} (Chordless)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has chord {2, 9}
- Cycle 2 has chord {2, 19}
- Cycle 3 has chord {2, 14}
- Cycle 4 has chord {2, 8}
- Cycle 5 has chord {11, 1}
- Cycle 6 has chord {17, 9}
- Cycle 7 has chord {17, 1}
- Cycle 8 has no chord
- Cycle 9 has chord {19, 14}
- Cycle 10 has chord {19, 8}

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<11, 2, 8, 9>
<11, 2, 19, 0>
<11, 2, 14, 1>
<11, 17, 1, 14>
<11, 17, 13, 9>
<11, 19, 2, 8>
