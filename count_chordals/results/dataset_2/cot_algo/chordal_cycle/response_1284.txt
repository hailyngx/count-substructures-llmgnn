Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 6) (12, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 3) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 2) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 10) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 11) (2, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 8 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 6 - 10 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 2 - 13 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 1 - 13 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 5: 5 - 10 - 4 - 12 - 5
- Cycle 6: 9 - 8 - 6 - 10 - 9
- Cycle 7: 9 - 14 - 11 - 13 - 9
- Cycle 8: 9 - 7 - 0 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 9: 6 - 8 - 9 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 10: 6 - 10 - 4 - 12 - 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, (2, 13), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
