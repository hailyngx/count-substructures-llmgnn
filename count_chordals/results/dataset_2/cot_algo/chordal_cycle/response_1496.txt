Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 2) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- (5, 9, 4, 8, 5)
- (10, 0, 4, 8, 2, 10)
- (6, 5, 9, 14, 6)
- (13, 10, 0, 4, 2, 13)
- (7, 13, 10, 1, 7)
- (12, 4, 8, 3, 12)
- (2, 8, 4, 0, 2)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord:
- <5, (9, 8), 4, (5, 8)>
- <10, (0, 4), 8, (2, 10)>
- <6, (5, 9), 14, (6, 9)>
- <13, (10, 0), 4, (2, 13)>
- <7, (13, 10), 1, (7, 10)>
- <12, (4, 8), 3, (12, 8)>
- <2, (8, 4), 0, (2, 4)>

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]
