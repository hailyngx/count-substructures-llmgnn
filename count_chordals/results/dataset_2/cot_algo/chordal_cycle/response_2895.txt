This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 4) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 15) (22, 17) (22, 8) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 12) (2, 19) (2, 9) (18, 5) (18, 15) (18, 29) (6, 22) (6, 28) (6, 21) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 21) (28, 12) (28, 10) (0, 11) (0, 25) (0, 19) (0, 9) (14, 5) (14, 21) (21, 6) (21, 28) (21, 14) (21, 20) (21, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 3) (29, 18) (29, 8) (25, 0) (25, 1) (27, 26) (27, 5) (26, 23) (26, 27) (26, 15) (26, 16) (11, 0) (11, 1) (24, 10) (24, 20) (3, 9) (3, 17) (3, 20) (3, 19) (17, 4) (17, 22) (17, 3) (1, 25) (1, 11) (15, 4) (15, 22) (15, 18) (15, 26) (16, 26) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 13) (20, 21) (20, 24) (20, 3) (12, 23) (12, 28) (12, 13) (13, 19) (13, 12) (8, 22) (8, 29) (8, 10) (10, 28) (10, 24) (10, 8) (5, 18) (5, 14) (5, 21) (5, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        
        - Cycle 1: <4, 7, 21, 6>
        - Cycle 2: <22, 6, 28, 21>
        - Cycle 3: <4, 17, 3, 19>
        - Cycle 4: <15, 18, 5, 14>
        - Cycle 5: <22, 17, 3, 19>
        - Cycle 6: <22, 17, 4, 7>
        - Cycle 7: <22, 17, 3, 20>
        - Cycle 8: <6, 21, 14, 5>
        - Cycle 9: <6, 21, 20, 3>
        - Cycle 10: <6, 21, 5, 27>
        - Cycle 11: <6, 28, 12, 23>
        - Cycle 12: <6, 28, 12, 13>
        - Cycle 13: <22, 15, 26, 23>
        - Cycle 14: <22, 15, 26, 16>
        - Cycle 15: <22, 15, 18, 5>
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <4, 7, 21, 6> with chord (4, 21)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <22, 6, 28, 21> with chord (6, 28)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, 17, 3, 19> with chord (17, 3)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <15, 18, 5, 14> with chord (18, 5)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <22, 17, 3, 19> with chord (17, 19)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <22, 17, 4, 7> with chord (17, 4)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <22, 17, 3, 20> with chord (17, 3)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, 21, 14, 5> with chord (21, 14)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <6, 21, 20, 3> with chord (21, 20)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <6, 21, 5, 27> with chord (21, 5)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <6, 28, 12, 23> with chord (28, 12)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <6, 28, 12, 13> with chord (28, 12)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <22, 15, 26, 23> with chord (15, 26)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 14: <22, 15, 26, 16> with chord (15, 26)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 15: <22, 15, 18, 5> with chord (15, 18)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.
        
        Final count: [15]
