Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 7 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 4 - 14 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 3: 1 - 7 - 9 - 12 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 11 - 14 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 5: 2 - 12 - 9 - 0 - 2
- Cycle 6: 3 - 10 - 1 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 7: 4 - 14 - 9 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 8: 5 - 6 - 9 - 13 - 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 9, 1, 7, 0> has chord (1, 7)
- <0, 4, 14, 9, 0> has chord (9, 14)
- <1, 7, 9, 12, 1> has chord (7, 9)
- <1, 11, 14, 4, 1> has chord (4, 14)
- <2, 12, 9, 0, 2> has chord (9, 12)
- <3, 10, 1, 7, 3> has chord (1, 7)
- <4, 14, 9, 8, 4> has chord (9, 8)
- <5, 6, 9, 13, 5> has chord (9, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [8].
