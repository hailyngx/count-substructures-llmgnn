Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (7, 0, 3, 2, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

For Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 4, 5), the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <1, (5, 4), 9)>.

For Cycle 2: (7, 0, 3, 2, 7), there are no unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The final count of unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord is [1].
