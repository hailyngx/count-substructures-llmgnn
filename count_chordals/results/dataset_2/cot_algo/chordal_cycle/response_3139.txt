Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
In this graph, there are several cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-2-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-6-9-5
- Cycle 3: 5-4-0-7-5
- Cycle 4: 2-6-7-0-2
- Cycle 5: 2-5-7-0-2
- Cycle 6: 2-8-0-4-2
- Cycle 7: 0-4-3-8-0
- Cycle 8: 0-9-6-1-0

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (6, 2)
- Cycle 2 has chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 3 has chord (0, 7)
- Cycle 4 has chord (6, 7)
- Cycle 5 has chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 6 has chord (0, 4)
- Cycle 7 has no chord
- Cycle 8 has chord (6, 1)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the answer is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (6, 2), 5>
- <2, (1, 6), 5>
- <3, (0, 7), 5>
- <4, (6, 7), 2>
- <5, (5, 7), 2>
- <6, (0, 4), 2>
- <7, (6, 1), 0>
