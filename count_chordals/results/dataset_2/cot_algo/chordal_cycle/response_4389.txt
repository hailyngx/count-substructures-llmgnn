Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (8, 17), 1>
- <2, (7, 10), 2>
- <3, (0, 15), 3>
- <4, (9, 16), 4>
- <5, (4, 5), 5>
- <6, (6, 18), 6>
- <7, (1, 16), 7>
- <8, (12, 19), 8>
- <9, (8, 15), 9>
- <10, (10, 7), 10>
- <11, (11, 12), 11>
- <12, (17, 5), 12>
- <13, (13, 18), 13>
- <14, (14, 15), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 14

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
