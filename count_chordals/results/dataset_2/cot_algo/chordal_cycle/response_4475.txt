The edges are as follows: (3, 9) (3, 2) (15, 27) (15, 23) (15, 5) (15, 24) (27, 15) (18, 22) (18, 5) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 29) (22, 7) (10, 11) (10, 26) (10, 2) (10, 20) (11, 10) (11, 13) (28, 16) (28, 19) (28, 20) (29, 22) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 25) (4, 9) (4, 1) (17, 29) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 9) (7, 22) (7, 24) (7, 23) (7, 1) (12, 18) (12, 24) (5, 15) (5, 18) (5, 8) (6, 14) (6, 25) (6, 13) (24, 15) (24, 7) (24, 12) (26, 10) (26, 16) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 13) (16, 28) (16, 26) (16, 19) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 21) (25, 29) (25, 6) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 20) (19, 28) (19, 16) (19, 21) (8, 5) (8, 20) (8, 0) (14, 6) (14, 21) (23, 15) (23, 7) (23, 0) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 23) (21, 9) (21, 19) (21, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 1) (20, 10) (20, 28) (20, 2) (20, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
<0, 17, 1, 7, 24>
<0, 17, 29, 22, 18>
<0, 17, 29, 25, 6>
<0, 17, 9, 4, 1>
<0, 8, 20, 28, 16>
<0, 8, 20, 2, 3>
<0, 8, 5, 15, 24>
<0, 23, 15, 5, 18>
<0, 23, 7, 22, 18>
<1, 17, 29, 22, 7>
<1, 17, 29, 25, 6>
<2, 10, 11, 13, 1>
<2, 10, 20, 28, 19>
<2, 20, 8, 5, 15>
<3, 9, 17, 29, 25>
<4, 9, 17, 1, 13>
<5, 8, 0, 17, 29>
<6, 13, 1, 4, 9>
<6, 13, 11, 10, 2>
<6, 14, 21, 19, 16>
<6, 25, 29, 22, 7>
<7, 22, 18, 5, 15>
<8, 0, 23, 15, 5>
<10, 11, 13, 6, 14>
<10, 20, 8, 0, 23>
<12, 18, 5, 15, 24>
<15, 5, 8, 20, 28>
<16, 19, 21, 14, 6>
<17, 1, 4, 9, 21>
<18, 5, 8, 20, 2>
<22, 18, 12, 24, 7>
<28, 20, 8, 0, 17>

Step 2: 
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0, 17, 1, 7, 24> - Chord: (17, 7)
<0, 17, 29, 22, 18> - Chord: (17, 22)
<0, 8, 20, 2, 3> - Chord: (8, 2)
<0, 8, 5, 15, 24> - Chord: (8, 15)
<1, 17, 29, 22, 7> - Chord: (17, 22)
<1, 17, 29, 25, 6> - Chord: (17, 6)
<2, 10, 11, 13, 1> - Chord: (10, 13)
<2, 10, 20, 28, 19> - Chord: (10, 28)
<3, 9, 17, 29, 25> - Chord: (9, 29)
<4, 9, 17, 1, 13> - Chord: (9, 1)
<5, 8, 0, 17, 29> - Chord: (8, 17)
<6, 13, 1, 4, 9> - Chord: (13, 4)
<7, 22, 18, 5, 15> - Chord: (22, 5)
<10, 20, 8, 0, 23> - Chord: (20, 0)
<15, 5, 8, 20, 28> - Chord: (5, 20)
<17, 1, 4, 9, 21> - Chord: (1, 9)

Step 3:
- The number of chordless cycles found is [16]
