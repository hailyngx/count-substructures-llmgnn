Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 17) (1, 13) (21, 16) (21, 9) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 29) (7, 19) (7, 5) (20, 18) (20, 23) (20, 24) (25, 27) (25, 17) (25, 6) (12, 27) (12, 26) (12, 23) (27, 25) (27, 12) (27, 11) (0, 11) (0, 23) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 9) (17, 15) (29, 7) (29, 5) (29, 15) (16, 21) (16, 28) (16, 9) (28, 16) (28, 22) (28, 24) (28, 10) (18, 20) (26, 12) (26, 14) (23, 20) (23, 12) (23, 0) (23, 2) (14, 26) (14, 6) (6, 4) (6, 25) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 13) (8, 24) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 3) (24, 20) (24, 28) (24, 8) (2, 23) (2, 3) (19, 7) (19, 13) (9, 21) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 16) (10, 28) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 27) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 22) (22, 28) (22, 11) (22, 15) (5, 7) (5, 29) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 19) (13, 3) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 13) (15, 17) (15, 29) (15, 22) 

Response:
The graph has the following chordal 4-cycles:

1. <1, 21, 9, 17>
2. <4, 7, 29, 5>
3. <20, 18, 26, 12>
4. <23, 0, 11, 8>
5. <6, 4, 9, 16>
6. <10, 28, 16, 22>
7. <15, 17, 9, 29>

Therefore, there are a total of [7] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
