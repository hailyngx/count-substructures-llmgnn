Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 9) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 6) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 9) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 2 - 4
2. Cycle 2: 4 - 13 - 10 - 1 - 4
3. Cycle 3: 4 - 0 - 3 - 2 - 4
4. cycle 4: 4 - 11 - 3 - 2 - 4
5. Cycle 5: 7 - 2 - 3 - 11 - 7
6. Cycle 6: 7 - 2 - 3 - 0 - 12 - 6 - 2 - 7
7. Cycle 7: 1 - 10 - 12 - 6 - 5 - 1
8. Cycle 8: 3 - 11 - 2 - 8 - 13 - 3
9. Cycle 9: 3 - 0 - 6 - 12 - 3
10. Cycle 10: 10 - 13 - 8 - 2 - 7 - 10
11. Cycle 11: 10 - 5 - 6 - 12 - 10
12. Cycle 12: 11 - 3 - 14 - 6 - 12 - 11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <4, 7, 2, 4> has a chord (7-2)
- <4, 13, 10, 1, 4> has a chord (13-1)
- <4, 0, 3, 2, 4> has a chord (0-3)
- <4, 11, 3, 2, 4> has a chord (11-3)
- <7, 2, 3, 11, 7> has a chord (2-11)
- <7, 2, 3, 0, 12, 6, 2, 7> has a chord (3-12)
- <1, 10, 12, 6, 5, 1> has a chord (10-5)
- <3, 11, 2, 8, 13, 3> has a chord (11-8)
- <3, 0, 6, 12, 3> has a chord (0-6)
- <10, 13, 8, 2, 7, 10> has a chord (13-8)
- <10, 5, 6, 12, 10> has a chord (5-12)
- <11, 3, 14, 6, 12, 11> has a chord (3-14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
