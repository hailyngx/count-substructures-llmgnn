Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 11) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 14) (9, 3) (9, 2) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 5, 10) with edges (1, 6), (6, 5), (5, 10), (10, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 11, 3) with edges (1, 4), (4, 11), (11, 3), (3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 8, 14, 0) with edges (1, 8), (8, 14), (14, 0), (0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 11, 4, 5) with edges (3, 11), (11, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 9, 2, 4) with edges (3, 9), (9, 2), (2, 4), (4, 3)
- Cycle 6: (10, 5, 4, 11) with edges (10, 5), (5, 4), (4, 11), (11, 10)
- Cycle 7: (10, 7, 8, 1) with edges (10, 7), (7, 8), (8, 1), (1, 10)
- Cycle 8: (5, 14, 8, 1) with edges (5, 14), (14, 8), (8, 1), (1, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 6, 1, 4) with edges (5, 6), (6, 1), (1, 4), (4, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 7, 6, 1) with edges (5, 7), (7, 6), (6, 1), (1, 5)
- Cycle 11: (0, 14, 8, 1) with edges (0, 14), (14, 8), (8, 1), (1, 0)
- Cycle 12: (14, 0, 5, 10) with edges (14, 0), (0, 5), (5, 10), (10, 14)
- Cycle 13: (14, 6, 5, 10) with edges (14, 6), (6, 5), (5, 10), (10, 14)
- Cycle 14: (2, 1, 4, 11) with edges (2, 1), (1, 4), (4, 11), (11, 2)
- Cycle 15: (7, 10, 5, 6) with edges (7, 10), (10, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 8, 14, 5) with edges (7, 8), (8, 14), (14, 5), (5, 7)
- Cycle 17: (12, 3, 11, 4) with edges (12, 3), (3, 11), (11, 4), (4, 12)
- Cycle 18: (13, 4, 11, 3) with edges (13, 4), (4, 11), (11, 3), (3, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (5, 10)
- Cycle 2 has chord (4, 11)
- Cycle 3 has chord (8, 14)
- Cycle 4 has chord (3, 11)
- Cycle 5 has chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 6 has chord (5, 11)
- Cycle 7 has chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 8 has chord (5, 14)
- Cycle 9 has chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 10 has chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 11 has chord (0, 14)
- Cycle 12 has chord (0, 14)
- Cycle 13 has chord (6, 14)
- Cycle 14 has chord (1, 11)
- Cycle 15 has chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 16 has chord (7, 14)
- Cycle 17 has chord (3, 11)
- Cycle 18 has chord (4, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
Since all cycles have exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [18].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 6, 5, 10> with chord (5, 10)
- <1, 4, 11, 3> with chord (4, 11)
- <1, 8, 14, 0> with chord (8, 14)
- <3, 11, 4, 5> with chord (3, 11)
- <3, 9, 2, 4> with chord (3, 9)
- <10, 5, 4, 11> with chord (5, 11)
- <10, 7, 8, 1> with chord (7, 8)
- <5, 14, 8, 1> with chord (5, 14)
- <5, 6, 1, 4> with chord (1, 4)
- <5, 7, 6, 1> with chord (5, 7)
- <0, 14, 8, 1> with chord (0, 14)
- <14, 6, 5, 10> with chord (6, 14)
- <2, 1, 4, 11> with chord (1, 11)
- <7, 10, 5, 6> with chord (5, 6)
- <7, 8, 14, 5> with chord (7, 14)
- <12, 3, 11, 4> with chord (3, 11)
- <13, 4, 11, 3> with chord (4, 11)
