Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 4) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (14, 6) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 5) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 10, 1, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 13, 3, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 10, 2, 13, 6)
- Cycle 4: (9, 10, 11, 4, 8, 13, 9)
- Cycle 5: (10, 11, 4, 8, 1, 10)
- Cycle 6: (10, 7, 0, 11, 10)
- Cycle 7: (11, 4, 14, 6, 13, 8, 11)
- Cycle 8: (8, 13, 6, 0, 7, 8)
- Cycle 9: (8, 4, 5, 2, 13, 8)
- Cycle 10: (13, 2, 7, 0, 6, 9, 13)
- Cycle 11: (4, 5, 14, 3, 13, 8, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 3: <3, (2, 13), 6> with chord (2, 13)
- Cycle 4: <4, (8, 13), 9> with chord (8, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles is [2].

So, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <3, (2, 13), 6>
- <4, (8, 13), 9>
