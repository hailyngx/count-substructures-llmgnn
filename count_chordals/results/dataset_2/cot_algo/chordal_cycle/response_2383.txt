Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 1) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 4) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 4) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 4) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:  
- Cycle 1: 9 - 13 - 12 - 10 - 9  
- Cycle 2: 4 - 9 - 13 - 12 - 4  
- Cycle 3: 10 - 12 - 14 - 3 - 10  
- Cycle 4: 10 - 12 - 7 - 2 - 10  
- Cycle 5: 7 - 12 - 14 - 4 - 7  

Step 2:  
The chordal 4-cycles are:  
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <9, 10, 12, 13>, chord: (10, 12)  
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, 9, 12, 13>, chord: (9, 12)  
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <10, 12, 14, 3>, chord: (12, 14)  
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <10, 12, 7, 2>, chord: (12, 7)  
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <7, 12, 14, 4>, chord: (12, 14)  

Step 3:  
There are [5] chordal 4-cycles found.
