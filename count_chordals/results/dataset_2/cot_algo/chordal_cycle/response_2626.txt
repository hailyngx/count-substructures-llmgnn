Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 9) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 14) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 14) (9, 10) 

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <1, 3, 10, 6> with a chord (2, 12).
        
        Step 1: List of cycles of length 4:
        - Cycle 1: 1, 3, 10, 6
        - Cycle 2: 2, 3, 10, 6
        - Cycle 3: 1, 3, 10, 9
        - Cycle 4: 1, 2, 8, 11    ...
        (other cycles are longer)

        Step 2: Checking for chord:
        - Cycle 1 (1, 3, 10, 6): Chord (2, 12) forms a unique chordal 4-cycle.

        Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles = [1].
