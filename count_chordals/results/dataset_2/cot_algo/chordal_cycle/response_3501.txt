Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 7) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 8) (2, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1:  
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-2-1-7-0
- Cycle 2: 0-2-4-9-11-14-6-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-3-6-14-11-9-4-0
- Cycle 4: 0-2-12-10-5-7-1-4-0

Step 2:  
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 0-2-1-7-0 has one chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 2: 0-2-4-9-11-14-6-0 has one chord (2, 9)
- Cycle 3: 0-2-3-6-14-11-9-4-0 has one chord (2, 6)
- Cycle 4: 0-2-12-10-5-7-1-4-0 has one chord (2, 10)

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:  
There is no chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
