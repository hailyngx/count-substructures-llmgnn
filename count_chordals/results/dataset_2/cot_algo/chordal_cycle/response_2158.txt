Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 4) (16, 18) (16, 9) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 15) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 15) (9, 12) (19, 5) (19, 17) (19, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 13) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 13) (17, 19) (17, 12) (17, 15) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (15, 5) (15, 9) (15, 17) (18, 16) (18, 5) (18, 14) (12, 9) (12, 17) (10, 19) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 4) (10, 13) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 0) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 10) 

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- <0, 8, 11, 4>
- <1, 5, 18, 16>
- <1, 5, 15, 9>
- <1, 5, 19, 17>
- <1, 2, 7, 8>
- <1, 2, 0, 8>
- <1, 13, 10, 14>
- <1, 13, 6, 14>
- <2, 7, 8, 11>
- <2, 7, 10, 14>
- <2, 1, 5, 15>
- <4, 0, 2, 7>
- <4, 0, 8, 11>
- <4, 10, 13, 1>
- <4, 10, 14, 6>
- <5, 1, 2, 0>
- <5, 1, 6, 14>
- <5, 15, 17, 19>
- <5, 15, 9, 16>
- <6, 1, 2, 0>
- <7, 2, 1, 5>
- <7, 10, 14, 6>
- <7, 10, 13, 1>
- <8, 0, 4, 11>
- <8, 0, 2, 7>
- <9, 11, 4, 10>
- <9, 11, 8, 0>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 8, 11, 4>  (Chord: 8-11)
- <1, 5, 18, 16>  (Chord: 5-16)
- <1, 5, 15, 9>   (Chord: 5-15)
- <1, 13, 6, 14>  (Chord: 13-6)
- <4, 10, 13, 1>  (Chord: 10-13)
- <5, 15, 17, 19> (Chord: 15-17)
- <7, 2, 1, 5>    (Chord: 2-5)
- <9, 11, 4, 10>  (Chord: 11-10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, in this case, [8].
