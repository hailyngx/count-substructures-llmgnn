Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 6, 2, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 2, 4, 9)
- Cycle 5: (6, 1, 5, 6)
- Cycle 6: (4, 8, 5, 4)
- Cycle 7: (8, 2, 4, 8)
- Cycle 8: (2, 6, 9, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 7, 9, 2)
- Cycle 10: (0, 6, 4, 0)
- Cycle 11: (0, 7, 2, 0)
- Cycle 12: (7, 5, 8, 7)
- Cycle 13: (7, 0, 6, 7)
- Cycle 14: (1, 5, 8, 1)
- Cycle 15: (3, 9, 6, 3)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <9, (6, 1), 5>: Cycle 2 has a chord (6, 1).
- <9, (6, 2), 9>: Cycle 3 has a chord (6, 2).
- <9, (2, 4), 9>: Cycle 4 has a chord (2, 4).
- <6, (1, 5), 6>: Cycle 5 has a chord (1, 5).
- <4, (8, 5), 4>: Cycle 6 has a chord (8, 5).
- <8, (2, 4), 8>: Cycle 7 has a chord (2, 4).
- <2, (6, 9), 2>: Cycle 8 has a chord (6, 9).
- <2, (7, 9), 2>: Cycle 9 has a chord (7, 9).
- <0, (4, 6), 0>: Cycle 10 has a chord (4, 6).
- <0, (7, 2), 0>: Cycle 11 has a chord (7, 2).
- <7, (5, 8), 7>: Cycle 12 has a chord (5, 8).
- <7, (0, 6), 7>: Cycle 13 has a chord (0, 6).
- <1, (5, 8), 1>: Cycle 14 has a chord (5, 8).
- <3, (9, 6), 3>: Cycle 15 has a chord (9, 6).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.

Putting the final number inside brackets, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
