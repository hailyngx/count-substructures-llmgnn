Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are three cycles of length 4 in this graph:
1. (1, 3, 5, 6, 1)
2. (4, 7, 2, 6, 4)
3. (6, 7, 9, 3, 6)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. (1, 3, 5, 6, 1) has exactly one chord (3, 6)
2. (4, 7, 2, 6, 4) has no chords.
3. (6, 7, 9, 3, 6) has no chords.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<(1, 3, 5, 6, 1), (3, 6)>
