Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 2) (8, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 19) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 18) (14, 19) (14, 13) (5, 11) (5, 7) (13, 14) (13, 16) (13, 3) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 19) (11, 17) (19, 0) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 1) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 12) (4, 6) (4, 15) (4, 17) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 15) (7, 10) (7, 17) (15, 4) (15, 7) (12, 1) (12, 6) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 18) (10, 7) (10, 6) (10, 16) (16, 13) (16, 10) (18, 14) (18, 3) (18, 6) (17, 11) (17, 4) (17, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 1-2-8-11-5-7-2
- Cycle 2: 0-3-13-14-1-2-8-11-5-7
- Cycle 3: 0-3-13-14-19-11-5-7
- Cycle 4: 0-3-13-14-19-1-2-8-11-17-4-6-12-1
- Cycle 5: 0-3-13-16-10-7-5-11-19-1-14-18-6
- Cycle 6: 4-17-11-5-7-15-4
- Cycle 7: 4-17-7-5-11-8-2-1-14-18-6-10-16-13-3
- Cycle 8: 18-6-4-17-11-5-7-2-1-14-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1: No chord
- Cycle 2: Chord (11, 5)
- Cycle 3: Chord (19, 7)
- Cycle 4: Chord (1, 17)
- Cycle 5: Chord (16, 10)
- Cycle 6: No chord
- Cycle 7: Chord (7, 14)
- Cycle 8: Chord (4, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 5 chordal 4-cycles in this graph. Thus, the final number is [5].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <1, 17, 2, 8, 11, 5>
2. <14, 7, 19, 1, 2, 8, 11>
3. <3, 13, 16, 10, 7, 5, 11>
4. <6, 4, 17, 11, 5, 7, 15>
5. <18, 6, 10, 16, 13, 14, 1>
