Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 15) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 19) (8, 19) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 10) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 12) (0, 2) (19, 11) (19, 9) (19, 8) (19, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 18) (1, 2) (3, 19) (14, 4) (14, 6) (14, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 18) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 18) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 10) (18, 15) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 16, 15, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 9, 6, 5, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 9, 19, 8, 4)
- Cycle 4: (8, 19, 3, 19, 8)
- Cycle 5: (0, 8, 19, 3, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 12, 13, 10, 0)
- Cycle 7: (5, 6, 17, 18, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord (7, 15): <1, (7, 15), 4>
- Cycle 2 has a chord (9, 5): <2, (9, 5), 4>
- Cycle 3 has a chord (9, 8): <3, (9, 8), 4>
- Cycle 4 has a chord (19, 3): <4, (19, 3), 8>
- Cycle 5 has a chord (8, 19): <5, (8, 19), 0>
- Cycle 6 has a chord (12, 13): <6, (12, 13), 10>
- Cycle 7 has a chord (6, 17): <7, (6, 17), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [7].
