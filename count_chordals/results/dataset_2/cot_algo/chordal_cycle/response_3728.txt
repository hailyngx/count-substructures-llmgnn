Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (12, 27) (12, 14) (12, 8) (12, 9) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 16) (8, 12) (8, 23) (8, 24) (8, 26) (8, 3) (23, 8) (23, 11) (23, 10) (11, 23) (11, 0) (11, 17) (28, 1) (28, 10) (9, 12) (9, 24) (9, 20) (22, 15) (22, 0) (4, 1) (4, 25) (18, 27) (18, 21) (26, 8) (5, 19) (5, 25) (5, 21) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 7) (29, 7) (29, 25) (29, 10) (17, 11) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 24) (20, 9) (20, 17) (16, 27) (16, 21) (16, 15) (21, 18) (21, 5) (21, 16) (21, 2) (15, 22) (15, 19) (15, 16) (6, 17) (6, 14) (6, 0) (7, 19) (7, 29) (7, 24) (7, 14) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 10) (3, 8) (3, 2) (24, 8) (24, 9) (24, 17) (24, 7) (1, 28) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 21) (2, 3) (2, 1) (0, 11) (0, 22) (0, 6) (0, 25) (25, 4) (25, 5) (25, 29) (25, 0) (10, 23) (10, 28) (10, 29) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:  
- Cycle 1: (12, 14, 6, 0, 11, 23, 8, 12)
- Cycle 2: (12, 14, 6, 17, 20, 9, 12)
- Cycle 3: (12, 27, 18, 21, 5, 25, 29, 10, 14, 12)
- Cycle 4: (8, 12, 14, 7, 29, 25, 5, 21, 2, 3, 8)
- Cycle 5: (8, 12, 9, 24, 17, 20, 28, 1, 4, 25, 29, 10, 23, 11, 0, 6, 14, 7, 24, 9)
- Cycle 6: (12, 9, 24, 7, 14, 6, 0, 25, 4, 1, 28, 10, 29, 7)
- Cycle 7: (12, 8, 26, 5, 19, 15, 22, 0, 11, 17, 24, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle: <(23, 6)>
- Cycle 2 is not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 3 is a chordal 4-cycle: <(5, 10)>
- Cycle 4 is a chordal 4-cycle: <(7, 2)>
- Cycle 5 is a chordal 4-cycle: <(24, 10)>
- Cycle 6 is not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 7 is not a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<12, 14, 6, (23, 11), (8, 12)>
<12, 27, 18, 21, 5, 25, 29, 10, (5, 21), 14)>
<8, 12, (7, 2), 3, 8>
<8, 12, 9, 24, 17, 20, 28, 1, 4, 25, 29, 10, (24, 10), 9)>
