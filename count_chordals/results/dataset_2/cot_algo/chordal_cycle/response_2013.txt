Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 15) (9, 6) (9, 16) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 11) (0, 6) (0, 17) (0, 5) (14, 2) (14, 13) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 13) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 18) (1, 11) (1, 17) (1, 18) (17, 0) (17, 1) (19, 4) (19, 7) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 16) (7, 2) (16, 9) (16, 7) (16, 12) (12, 9) (12, 16) (10, 13) (10, 2) (18, 3) (18, 11) (18, 1) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph, but we need to focus on cycles of length 4 or more.
- Cycle 1: 3-15-9-6-3
- Cycle 2: 6-9-15-13-6
- Cycle 3: 6-9-15-5-6
- Cycle 4: 6-9-16-7-6
- Cycle 5: 6-0-5-13-6
- Cycle 6: 9-15-13-14-9
- Cycle 7: 9-15-5-0-9
- Cycle 8: 15-13-14-2-15
- Cycle 9: 15-13-5-0-15
- Cycle 10: 15-5-0-17-15
- Cycle 11: 15-5-13-14-15
- Cycle 12: 15-9-6-0-15
- Cycle 13: 15-9-12-16-15
- Cycle 14: 16-12-9-6-16
- Cycle 15: 16-12-9-15-16

Step 2:
- <3, 15, 9, 6>: 3-15-9-6 has a single chord (15, 6)
- <6, 9, 15, 13>: 6-9-15-13 has a single chord (9, 13)
- <6, 9, 15, 5>: 6-9-15-5 has a single chord (9, 5)
- <6, 9, 16, 7>: 6-9-16-7 has a single chord (9, 7)
- <6, 0, 5, 13>: 6-0-5-13 has a single chord (0, 13)
- <9, 15, 13, 14>: 9-15-13-14 has a single chord (15, 14)
- <9, 15, 5, 0>: 9-15-5-0 has a single chord (15, 0)
- <15, 13, 14, 2>: 15-13-14-2 has a single chord (13, 2)
- <15, 13, 5, 0>: 15-13-5-0 has a single chord (13, 5)
- <15, 5, 0, 17>: 15-5-0-17 has a single chord (5, 17)
- <15, 9, 6, 0>: 15-9-6-0 has a single chord (9, 6)
- <15, 9, 12, 16>: 15-9-12-16 has a single chord (9, 16)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we find that there are [12] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
