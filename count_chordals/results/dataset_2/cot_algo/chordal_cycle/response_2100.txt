Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 29) (2, 18) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 20) (29, 11) (3, 13) (3, 26) (3, 4) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 21) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 29) (11, 10) (11, 27) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 16) (21, 25) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 13) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 23) (14, 13) (17, 25) (17, 20) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 24) (28, 21) (15, 2) (15, 20) (20, 29) (20, 17) (20, 15) (20, 19) (19, 20) (19, 22) (26, 3) (26, 1) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 26) (12, 2) (12, 7) (12, 16) (5, 10) (5, 23) (8, 14) (8, 24) (8, 4) (9, 25) (9, 10) (9, 18) (0, 7) (6, 10) (6, 24) (24, 18) (24, 8) (24, 6) (24, 27) (24, 4) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 23) (16, 4) (23, 14) (23, 5) (23, 16) (22, 19) (22, 27) (13, 3) (13, 21) (13, 14) (27, 11) (27, 24) (27, 22) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 24) (4, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: {2, 29, 20, 15, 2}
- Cycle 2: {3, 13, 21, 25, 17, 20, 15, 2, 12, 7, 21, 13, 3}
- Cycle 3: {10, 11, 29, 20, 19, 22, 27, 24, 18, 9, 10}
- Cycle 4: {11, 29, 20, 17, 25, 9, 10, 11}
- Cycle 5: {10, 9, 25, 17, 20, 19, 22, 27, 24, 18, 10}
- Cycle 6: {21, 13, 14, 1, 2, 12, 7, 21}

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, 15>
- Cycle 2: <3, 25>
- Cycle 3: <22, 9>
- Cycle 4: <17, 10>
- Cycle 5: No chord found
- Cycle 6: <2, 7>

Step 3: Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <2, (1, 15), 29>
- <3, (25, 17), 13>
- <10, (22, 9), 11>
- <21, (2, 7), 13>
