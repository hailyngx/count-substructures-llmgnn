Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 13) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 4) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (4, 6) (4, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-14-6-5
- Cycle 2: 5-8-13-3-5
- Cycle 3: 5-0-9-14-5
- Cycle 4: 5-12-1-11-5
- Cycle 5: 6-14-9-5-6
- Cycle 6: 1-12-8-5-1
- Cycle 7: 1-11-8-5-1
- Cycle 8: 1-7-3-13-1
- Cycle 9: 3-13-8-5-3
- Cycle 10: 6-2-13-5-6
- Cycle 11: 7-14-9-0-7
- Cycle 12: 7-2-13-3-7
- Cycle 13: 10-11-8-5-10
- Cycle 14: 10-7-14-9-10

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:


Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: []
