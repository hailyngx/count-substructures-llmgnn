Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Possible cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1-6-5-8-1-4 (Chords: 5-8, 6-4)
2. Cycle 1-4-8-5-6-1 (Chords: 4-5, 8-6)
3. Cycle 1-6-3-7-1-4 (Chords: 6-7, 3-4)
4. Cycle 1-4-3-6-1-8 (Chords: 4-6, 3-8)

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 1-6-5-8-1-4 has exactly one chord 5-4
2. Cycle 1-4-8-5-6-1 has exactly one chord 4-6
3. Cycle 1-6-3-7-1-4 has exactly one chord 3-4
4. Cycle 1-4-3-6-1-8 has exactly one chord 3-8

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, 6, 5, 8, 1, 4>
<1, 4, 8, 5, 6, 1>
<1, 6, 3, 7, 1, 4>
<1, 4, 3, 6, 1, 8>
