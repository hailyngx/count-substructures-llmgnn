Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 11) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 5) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 2) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 13) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 12) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (1, 8, 10, 11, 5)
- Cycle 2: (2, 7, 8, 10, 14)
- Cycle 3: (3, 9, 13, 7, 2)
- Cycle 4: (5, 6, 10, 11, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 11, 13, 7)
- Cycle 6: (5, 0, 14, 10, 11)
- Cycle 7: (0, 5, 11, 13, 0)
- Cycle 8: (0, 5, 1, 8, 10)
- Cycle 9: (0, 14, 10, 8, 1)
- Cycle 10: (7, 8, 10, 11, 13)

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
    * Cycle 1 has chords: (10, 5)
    * Cycle 2 has chords: (7, 14)
    * Cycle 3 has chords: (9, 13)
    * Cycle 4 has no chords
    * Cycle 5 has chords: (6, 11)
    * Cycle 6 has chords: (10, 11)
    * Cycle 7 has chords: (5, 11)
    * Cycle 8 has no chords
    * Cycle 9 has no chords
    * Cycle 10 has chords: (8, 11)

Step 3:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique Chordal 4-Cycles:
1. <1, (10, 5), 8>
2. <2, (7, 14), 8>
3. <3, (9, 13), 7>
4. <5, 6, 10, 11>
5. <7, (5, 11), 13>
