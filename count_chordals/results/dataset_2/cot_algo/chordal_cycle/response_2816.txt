Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 12) (14, 13) (14, 3) (14, 11) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 10) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 0) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 13, 8, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 13, 14, 3, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 13, 14, 11, 1, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 13, 14, 11, 12, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 9, 13, 8, 10, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 9, 13, 14, 3, 2, 1, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 8: (4, 7, 3, 2, 1, 5, 8, 13, 9, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has chord <7, 13>.
- Cycle 4 has chord <1, 14>.
- Cycle 5 has chord <6, 11>.
- Cycle 6 has chord <10, 3>.
- Cycle 7 has chord <2, 7>.
- Cycle 8 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordal 4-cycles = [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, 9, 13, 8>
- <5, 9, 13, 14>
- <5, 9, 13, 14>
- <4, 7, 3, 2>
