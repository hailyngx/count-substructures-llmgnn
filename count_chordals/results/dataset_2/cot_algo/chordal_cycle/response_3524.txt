Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 4, 8>
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 0, 7>
- Cycle 3: <1, 6, 7, 9>
- Cycle 4: <2, 3, 4, 9>
- Cycle 5: <2, 0, 5, 7>
- Cycle 6: <3, 1, 5, 7>
- Cycle 7: <3, 4, 0, 5>
- Cycle 8: <6, 1, 5, 7>
- Cycle 9: <6, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle 10: <7, 0, 2, 3>
- Cycle 11: <7, 5, 1, 9>
- Cycle 12: <7, 6, 1, 9>
- Cycle 13: <9, 1, 5, 0>
- Cycle 14: <9, 3, 4, 8>
- Cycle 15: <9, 4, 0, 7>

Step 2:
- From the cycles above, the unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
  - <1, 3, 4, 8, (3, 8)>
  - <1, 5, 0, 7, (5, 7)>
  - <1, 6, 7, 9, (6, 9)>
  - <2, 3, 4, 9, (3, 9)>
  - <2, 0, 5, 7, (0, 5)>
  - <9, 1, 5, 0, (1, 0)>
  - <9, 3, 4, 8, (3, 8)>
  - <9, 4, 0, 7, (4, 7)>

Step 3:
- Count of unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord: [8]
