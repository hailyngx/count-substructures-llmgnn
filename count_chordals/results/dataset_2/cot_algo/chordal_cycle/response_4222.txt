Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 0-6-2-5-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-6-2-3-8-7-0
- Cycle 3: 1-0-6-2-8-1
- Cycle 4: 1-0-6-4-9-3-8-1
- Cycle 5: 1-5-2-8-1
- Cycle 6: 2-3-8-1-5-2
- Cycle 7: 3-8-2-5-1-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <0, 6, 2, 5> has chord (6, 2)
- <0, 6, 2, 3, 8, 7> has chord (3, 8)
- <1, 0, 6, 2> has chord (1, 6)
- <1, 0, 6, 4, 9, 3> has chord (4, 9)
- <1, 5, 2, 8> has chord (5, 2)
- <2, 3, 8, 1> has chord (2, 8)
- <3, 8, 2, 5> has chord (3, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordal 4-cycles = [0]
