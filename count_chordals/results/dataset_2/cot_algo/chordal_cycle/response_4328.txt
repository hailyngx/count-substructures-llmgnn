Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 13) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 5) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 9) (10, 5) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 9) (7, 2) (7, 10) (7, 3) (7, 11) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 5) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 11) (14, 2) (14, 8) (9, 12) (9, 1) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 13) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 5, 8, 1, 6, 3, 12>
2. <0, 2, 5, 8, 12, 4, 13, 6>
3. <0, 2, 7, 10, 6, 1, 8, 5>
4. <0, 2, 7, 10, 9, 13, 6, 3>
5. <0, 11, 1, 8, 12, 6, 3, 7>
6. <0, 11, 5, 10, 6, 3, 7, 2>
7. <1, 6, 12, 4, 13, 9, 10, 0>
8. <1, 8, 12, 4, 13, 9, 10, 6>
9. <1, 8, 12, 6, 13, 9, 10, 0>
10. <2, 5, 8, 12, 4, 13, 9, 10>
11. <3, 6, 12, 4, 13, 9, 10, 7>
12. <5, 10, 9, 13, 6, 1, 8, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 5, 10> (chord: (0, 10))
2. <0, 11, 5, 10> (chord: (0, 10))
3. <1, 8, 12, 4> (chord: (1, 4))
4. <3, 6, 12, 4> (chord: (3, 4))
5. <5, 10, 9, 13> (chord: (5, 13))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

There are [5] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
