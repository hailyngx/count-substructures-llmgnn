Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-5-8-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-3-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-0-3-2-1
- Cycle 5: 3-9-8-5-3
- Cycle 6: 3-9-4-1-3
- Cycle 7: 3-9-7-0-3
- Cycle 8: 3-1-2-3
- Cycle 9: 3-1-4-5-3
- Cycle 10: 3-0-1-4-3
- Cycle 11: 4-3-2-6-4
- Cycle 12: 4-2-1-0-4
- Cycle 13: 4-2-7-9-4
- Cycle 14: 4-0-1-3-4
- Cycle 15: 8-5-4-9-8
- Cycle 16: 8-5-0-7-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (4, 2), 3>
- <1, (4, 5), 3>
- <3, (9, 7), 0>
- <4, (2, 6), 3>
- <4, (0, 1), 3>
- <8, (5, 9), 4>
- <8, (0, 7), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [7].
