Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <11, 16, 8, 1, 11> has a chord (11, 8).
        - <11, 24, 15, 0, 11> has a chord (11, 15).
        - <11, 20, 13, 21, 9, 1, 11> has a chord (11, 9).
        - <11, 18, 29, 22, 25, 20, 11> has a chord (11, 22).
        - <16, 11, 20, 25, 22, 8, 16> has a chord (16, 25).
        - <9, 1, 11, 20, 25, 22, 29, 9> has a chord (9, 20).
        - <9, 17, 5, 27, 25, 22, 29, 18, 9> has a chord (9, 25).
        - <9, 29, 28, 24, 15, 0, 10, 18, 9> has a chord (9, 15).
        - <10, 29, 22, 8, 1, 11, 18, 9, 17, 5, 10> has a chord (10, 8).
        - <13, 21, 9, 29, 22, 25, 20, 11, 24, 15, 13> has a chord (13, 11).
        - <7, 8, 16, 11, 1, 9, 17, 5, 27, 25, 7> has a chord (7, 17).
        - <14, 13, 21, 9, 1, 11, 20, 25, 12, 5, 14> has a chord (14, 25).
        - <23, 6, 26, 25, 27, 5, 17, 0, 15, 24, 23> has a chord (23, 17).
        - <4, 13, 21, 9, 1, 11, 20, 19, 17, 5, 4> has a chord (4, 20).
        - <18, 29, 22, 25, 12, 5, 17, 0, 15, 24, 18> has a chord (18, 5).


Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 15 chordal 4-cycles found in this graph, so the final answer is [15].
