Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-3-1
- Cycle 2: 2-5-4-1-2
- Cycle 3: 2-5-7-0-3-2
- Cycle 4: 3-4-7-6-3
- Cycle 5: 6-5-7-4-6
- Cycle 6: 6-5-2-1-4-6
- Cycle 7: 6-7-0-3-6

Step 2:  
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-3-1 has no chords
- Cycle 2: 2-5-4-1-2 has no chords
- Cycle 3: 2-5-7-0-3-2 has a chord (5, 0)
- Cycle 4: 3-4-7-6-3 has a chord (4, 6)
- Cycle 5: 6-5-7-4-6 has a chord (5, 4)
- Cycle 6: 6-5-2-1-4-6 has a chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 7: 6-7-0-3-6 has a chord (7, 3)

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles found = [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:  
<2, (5, 0)>  
<6, (5, 1)>
