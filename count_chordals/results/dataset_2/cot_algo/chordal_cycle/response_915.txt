Response:
The chordless cycles in the given graph are as follows:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <5, 13, 1, 11, 7>
- Cycle 2: <5, 13, 1, 18, 7>
- Cycle 3: <5, 13, 1, 11, 12>
- Cycle 4: <5, 13, 14, 7, 11>
- Cycle 5: <5, 13, 14, 7, 18>
- Cycle 6: <5, 13, 1, 18, 12>
- Cycle 7: <5, 13, 7, 14, 6>
- Cycle 8: <5, 13, 1, 11, 10>
- Cycle 9: <5, 13, 1, 11, 12>
- Cycle 10: <5, 3, 6, 14, 7>
- Cycle 11: <5, 3, 6, 14, 13>
- Cycle 12: <5, 3, 19, 8, 12>
- Cycle 13: <5, 3, 19, 8, 12>
- Cycle 14: <5, 3, 19, 8, 19>
- Cycle 15: <5, 3, 19, 15, 19>
- Cycle 16: <5, 3, 16, 10, 11>
- Cycle 17: <5, 3, 16, 10, 16>
- Cycle 18: <5, 18, 7, 14, 6>
- Cycle 19: <5, 18, 7, 14, 13>
- Cycle 20: <5, 18, 7, 11, 1>
- Cycle 21: <5, 18, 12, 8, 19>
- Cycle 22: <5, 18, 12, 8, 12>
- Cycle 23: <5, 18, 12, 8, 19>
- Cycle 24: <5, 18, 12, 8, 19>
- Cycle 25: <5, 18, 12, 8, 12>
- Cycle 26: <5, 18, 12, 8, 19>
- Cycle 27: <5, 18, 1, 11, 12>
- Cycle 28: <5, 18, 1, 11, 10>
- Cycle 29: <5, 18, 1, 13, 14>
- Cycle 30: <5, 2, 17, 11, 1>
- Cycle 31: <5, 2, 17, 11, 7>
- Cycle 32: <5, 2, 17, 11, 12>
- Cycle 33: <5, 9, 0, 14, 7>
- Cycle 34: <5, 9, 0, 14, 13>
- Cycle 35: <5, 9, 0, 14, 6>
- Cycle 36: <5, 9, 16, 10, 11>
- Cycle 37: <5, 9, 16, 10, 16>
- Cycle 38: <5, 9, 16, 3, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- From the above list, the cycle <5, 18, 7, 14, 13> has a chord: (5, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There is 37 cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [37].
