Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, 8, 9, 2> (Chord: (8, 9))
- <1, 8, 9, 14> (Chord: (8, 9))
- <1, 8, 6, 5> (Chord: (6, 5))
- <1, 8, 6, 7> (Chord: (6, 7))
- <1, 8, 5, 2> (Chord: (8, 5))
- <1, 11, 6, 5> (Chord: (11, 6))
- <1, 11, 6, 7> (Chord: (11, 6))
- <1, 13, 7, 5> (Chord: (7, 5))
- <2, 5, 8, 9> (Chord: (5, 8))
- <5, 7, 6, 8> (Chord: (7, 8))
- <6, 7, 5, 8> (Chord: (7, 8))
- <9, 8, 1, 11> (Chord: (1, 11))
- <9, 8, 5, 2> (Chord: (8, 5))
- <10, 6, 11, 13> (Chord: (6, 11))
- <13, 3, 10, 5> (Chord: (10, 5))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [14].
