Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (0, 6, 1, 3, 0)
- (0, 6, 9, 2, 0)
- (0, 6, 9, 2, 5, 0)
- (0, 6, 9, 2, 7, 0)
- (0, 3, 1, 6, 0)
- (0, 3, 1, 6, 9, 2, 0)
- (0, 3, 1, 6, 9, 2, 5, 0)
- (0, 3, 1, 6, 1, 5, 0)
- (0, 3, 1, 6, 1, 8, 0)
- (0, 3, 1, 5, 2, 0)
- (0, 3, 1, 5, 2, 9, 6, 0)
- (0, 3, 1, 5, 2, 9, 6, 0)
- (0, 3, 1, 5, 4, 2, 0)
- (0, 3, 1, 5, 4, 2, 7, 0)
- (0, 3, 1, 8, 0)
- (0, 3, 1, 8, 0)

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 6, 1, 3, 0> (Chord: (6, 3))
- <0, 6, 9, 2, 0> (Chord: (9, 2))
- <0, 6, 9, 2, 5, 0> (Chord: (9, 5))
- <0, 6, 9, 2, 7, 0> (Chord: (9, 7))
- <0, 3, 1, 6, 0> (Chord: (1, 6))
- <0, 3, 1, 6, 9, 2, 0> (Chord: (6, 9))
- <0, 3, 1, 6, 9, 2, 5, 0> (Chord: (6, 5))
- <0, 3, 1, 6, 1, 5, 0> (Chord: (1, 5))
- <0, 3, 1, 6, 1, 8, 0> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <0, 3, 1, 5, 2, 0> (Chord: (1, 2))
- <0, 3, 1, 5, 2, 9, 6, 0> (Chord: (9, 6))
- <0, 3, 1, 5, 4, 2, 0> (Chord: (4, 2))
- <0, 3, 1, 5, 4, 2, 7, 0> (Chord: (4, 7))
- <0, 3, 1, 8, 0> (Chord: (1, 8))

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [14].
