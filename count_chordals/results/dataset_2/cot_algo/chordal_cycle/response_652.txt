Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
        The cycles of length 4 or more are as follows -
        Cycle 1: 0-4-6-0
        Cycle 2: 0-4-8-0
        Cycle 3: 1-5-8-1
        Cycle 4: 1-7-3-1
        Cycle 5: 2-5-9-2
        Cycle 6: 2-6-4-2
        Cycle 7: 3-4-8-3
        Cycle 8: 3-7-1-3
        Cycle 9: 6-0-4-6
        Cycle 10: 6-2-5-6
        Cycle 11: 7-1-5-7
        Cycle 12: 7-3-9-7
        Cycle 13: 8-0-4-8
        Cycle 14: 8-1-7-8
        Cycle 15: 9-2-6-9
        Cycle 16: 9-3-7-9
        
Step 2: 
        Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are as follows -
        <0, (4, 8), 0>
        <1, (3, 7), 1>
        <3, (1, 7), 3>
        <2, (5, 9), 2>
        <6, (0, 4), 6>
        <5, (1, 7), 5>
        <8, (0, 4), 8>
        <7, (3, 9), 7>
        [8]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
