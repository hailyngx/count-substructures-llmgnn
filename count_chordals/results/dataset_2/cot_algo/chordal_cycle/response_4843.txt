Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle 1: 5-6-1-3-5
2. Cycle 2: 5-6-0-1-5
3. Cycle 3: 5-3-7-5
4. Cycle 4: 5-4-0-5
5. Cycle 5: 5-8-3-5
6. Cycle 6: 6-1-3-6
7. Cycle 7: 1-3-7-1
8. Cycle 8: 1-7-5-1
9. Cycle 9: 3-5-8-3
10. Cycle 10: 3-1-7-3
11. Cycle 11: 4-0-8-4

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Checking Cycle 1: 5-6-1-3-5 - <1, (6, 3)>
2. Checking Cycle 2: 5-6-0-1-5 - <2, (6, 1)>
3. Checking Cycle 3: 5-3-7-5 - No chordal 4-cycle
4. Checking Cycle 4: 5-4-0-5 - <4, (4, 0)>
5. Checking Cycle 5: 5-8-3-5 - <5, (8, 3)>
6. Checking Cycle 6: 6-1-3-6 - No chordal 4-cycle
7. Checking Cycle 7: 1-3-7-1 - No chordal 4-cycle
8. Checking Cycle 8: 1-7-5-1 - No chordal 4-cycle
9. Checking Cycle 9: 3-5-8-3 - No chordal 4-cycle
10. Checking Cycle 10: 3-1-7-3 - No chordal 4-cycle
11. Checking Cycle 11: 4-0-8-4 - No chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: 
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [3].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <1, (6, 3)>
2. <2, (6, 1)>
3. <5, (8, 3)>
