Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: 5-3-1-2-5
        - Cycle 2: 3-4-8-9-3
        - Cycle 3: 4-6-8-9-4
        - Cycle 4: 6-7-3-5-6
        - Cycle 5: 7-5-2-9-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Cycle 1: 5-3-(2)-1-5 <1, (2)>
        - Cycle 2: 3-4-(8)-9-3 <2, (8)>
        - Cycle 3: 4-6-(8)-9-4 <3, (8)>
        - Cycle 4: 6-7-(3)-5-6 <4, (3)>
        - Cycle 5: 7-5-(2)-9-7 <5, (2)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        - There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
