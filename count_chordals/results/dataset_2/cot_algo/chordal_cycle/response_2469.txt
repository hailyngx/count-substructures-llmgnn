Response:
Let's find the chordal 4-cycles in this graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <1, 2, 3, 10, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 18, 0, 2, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 10, 3, 16, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 10, 15, 7, 18, 1>
- Cycle 5: <3, 10, 15, 13, 3>
- Cycle 6: <3, 16, 5, 6, 3>
- Cycle 7: <3, 12, 15, 13, 3>
- Cycle 8: <8, 13, 10, 3, 8>
- Cycle 9: <13, 15, 12, 3, 13>
- Cycle 10: <13, 15, 7, 14, 13>
- Cycle 11: <10, 15, 12, 3, 10>
- Cycle 12: <10, 15, 7, 14, 10>
- Cycle 13: <10, 17, 6, 5, 10>
- Cycle 14: <17, 6, 5, 16, 17>
- Cycle 15: <5, 6, 14, 7, 5>
- Cycle 16: <6, 17, 10, 3, 6>
- Cycle 17: <6, 14, 7, 18, 6>
- Cycle 18: <2, 3, 16, 5, 2>
- Cycle 19: <2, 0, 18, 7, 2>
- Cycle 20: <0, 18, 7, 14, 0>
- Cycle 21: <7, 15, 12, 3, 7>
- Cycle 22: <7, 14, 6, 5, 7>
- Cycle 23: <7, 18, 1, 10, 7>
- Cycle 24: <19, 11, 7, 14, 19>
- Cycle 25: <19, 11, 4, 9, 19>
- Cycle 26: <9, 4, 11, 7, 9>
- Cycle 27: <4, 11, 7, 18, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Checking Cycle 1: <1, 2, 3, 10, 1> is a chordal 4-cycle with one chord: (3, 10)  
- Checking Cycle 4: <1, 10, 15, 7, 18, 1> is a chordal 4-cycle with one chord: (10, 15)
- Checking Cycle 10: <13, 15, 7, 14, 13> is a chordal 4-cycle with one chord: (7, 14)
- Checking Cycle 14: <17, 6, 5, 16, 17> is a chordal 4-cycle with one chord: (5, 16)
- Checking Cycle 24: <19, 11, 7, 14, 19> is a chordal 4-cycle with one chord: (7, 14)
- Checking Cycle 25: <19, 11, 4, 9, 19> is a chordal 4-cycle with one chord: (4, 9)
- Checking Cycle 27: <4, 11, 7, 18, 4> is a chordal 4-cycle with one chord: (7, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final number is [7].
