Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 1) (14, 2) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 10) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 14) (11, 3) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (5, 12) (5, 8) (5, 1) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1)

- Cycle 2: 0-10-6-2-0  
- Cycle 3: 0-1-5-8-0  
- Cycle 4: 0-1-10-6-0  
- Cycle 5: 0-1-4-3-0  
- Cycle 6: 0-9-13-2-0  
- Cycle 7: 1-8-5-12-1  
- Cycle 8: 1-8-7-3-1

- Cycle 15: 2-13-9-7-2  
- Cycle 16: 3-4-6-10-3  
- Cycle 17: 3-4-1-0-3  
- Cycle 18: 3-7-8-5-3  
- Cycle 19: 3-11-14-10-3

- Cycle 21: 4-14-11-3-4  
- Cycle 22: 5-8-7-12-5  
- Cycle 23: 5-1-0-9-5  
- Cycle 24: 5-12-7-3-5

- Cycle 31: 7-12-5-8-7  
- Cycle 32: 7-9-13-2-7  
- Cycle 33: 8-5-1-0-8  
- Cycle 34: 8-7-3-4-8  
- Cycle 35: 8-2-6-10-8  
- Cycle 36: 8-12-7-9-8  
- Cycle 37: 9-13-2-6-9  
- Cycle 38: 9-7-3-4-9  
- Cycle 39: 10-6-2-13-10  
- Cycle 40: 10-0-1-4-10  
- Cycle 41: 10-14-11-3-10  
- Cycle 42: 13-9-7-8-13  
- Cycle 43: 13-2-6-4-13  
- Cycle 44: 14-2-6-4-14  
- Cycle 45: 14-10-1-0-14  
- Cycle 46: 14-11-3-7-14  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):  
- Cycle 5 has a chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (9, 2)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 13 has a chord (9, 12)
- Cycle 14 has a chord (6, 12)
- Cycle 15 has a chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 18 has a chord (7, 1)
- Cycle 19 has a chord (4, 3)
- Cycle 20 has a chord (6, 1)
- Cycle 21 has a chord (1, 11)
- Cycle 26 has a chord (10, 0)
- Cycle 28 has a chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 29 has a chord (8, 1)
- Cycle 32 has a chord (13, 7)
- Cycle 34 has a chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 36 has a chord (8, 9)
- Cycle 43 has a chord (13, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
There are 46 cycles in total, and 27 cycles have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles is 46 - 27 = 19.  
So, the final answer is [19].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, (1, 3)>
<6, (9, 2)>
<10, (9, 6)>
<13, (9, 12)>
<14, (6, 12)>
<15, (9, 7)>
<18, (7, 1)>
<19, (4, 3)>
<20, (6, 1)>
<21, (1, 11)>
<26, (10, 0)>
<28, (7, 3)>
<29, (8, 1)>
<32, (13, 7)>
<34, (7, 3)>
<36, (8, 9)>
<43, (13, 4)>
