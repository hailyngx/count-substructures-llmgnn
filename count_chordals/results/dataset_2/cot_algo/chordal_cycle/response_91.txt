Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 19) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 0) (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 17) (7, 16) (7, 18) (12, 13) (12, 15) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 14) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 4) (19, 16) (19, 8) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 18) (0, 5) (17, 18) (17, 9) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 4) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 15) (9, 17) (10, 5) (10, 6) (15, 11) (15, 12) (15, 4) 

Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 in the graph:

- Cycle 1: {11, 16, 1, 0}
- Cycle 2: {11, 16, 7, 18}
- Cycle 3: {11, 0, 3, 18}
- Cycle 4: {16, 7, 18, 1}
- Cycle 5: {16, 1, 13, 12}
- Cycle 6: {16, 19, 8, 2}
- Cycle 7: {1, 13, 4, 14}
- Cycle 8: {3, 0, 18, 2}
- Cycle 9: {2, 8, 19, 16}
- Cycle 10: {2, 14, 4, 13}
- Cycle 11: {18, 7, 16, 11}
- Cycle 12: {18, 0, 5, 10}
- Cycle 13: {18, 17, 9, 17}
- Cycle 14: {7, 16, 19, 8}
- Cycle 15: {7, 18, 17, 9}
- Cycle 16: {12, 13, 1, 16}
- Cycle 17: {12, 15, 4, 13}
- Cycle 18: {8, 19, 16, 0}
- Cycle 19: {8, 14, 4, 13}
- Cycle 20: {5, 0, 3, 18}
- Cycle 21: {5, 10, 6, 14}
- Cycle 22: {13, 1, 16, 11}
- Cycle 23: {13, 4, 14, 6}
- Cycle 24: {19, 16, 11, 6}

Now, let's identify the chordal 4-cycle:

- <11, (1, 0), 16> (Cycle 1 with chord (1, 0))
- <18, (7, 16), 1> (Cycle 4 with chord (7, 16))
- <16, (1, 13), 12> (Cycle 5 with chord (1, 13))
- <1, (4, 14), 13> (Cycle 7 with chord (4, 14))
- <13, (4, 15), 12> (Cycle 17 with chord (4, 15))
- <8, (4, 13), 19> (Cycle 19 with chord (4, 13))
- <18, (0, 3), 2> (Cycle 20 with chord (0, 3))
- <14, (6, 10), 5> (Cycle 21 with chord (6, 10))
- <16, (11, 6), 19> (Cycle 24 with chord (11, 6))

Therefore, there are a total of [8] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
