Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 4) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (1, 14) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 10) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more (with all edges existing):
- Cycle 1: 0-5-9-4-12-6-7-0
- Cycle 2: 1-8-5-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-8-10-9-3-13-11-1
- Cycle 4: 2-5-9-3-10-2
- Cycle 5: 4-5-9-3-13-6-4
- Cycle 6: 4-14-11-13-0-7-6-4

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords (5, 4) and (9, 12).
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has 2 chords (8, 10) and (9, 13).
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has 2 chords (5, 9) and (3, 13).
- Cycle 6 has 2 chords (14, 11) and (13, 0).

Step 3: Number of chordal 4-cycles found = [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0-5-9-4-12-6-7-0> (Chords: (5, 4) and (9, 12))
- <1-8-10-9-3-13-11-1> (Chords: (8, 10) and (9, 13))
- <4-14-11-13-0-7-6-4> (Chords: (14, 11) and (13, 0))
