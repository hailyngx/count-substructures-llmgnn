Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 11) (11, 10) (11, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 12) (2, 11) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 1) (12, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 2) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph, some of them are:
- (5, 9, 10, 6)
- (9, 10, 11, 2)
- (10, 11, 2, 0)
- (5, 14, 12, 9)
- (8, 3, 2, 0)
- (1, 12, 2, 0)
- (4, 13, 14, 12)

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- (5, 9, 10, 6) has one chord 9-10
- (9, 10, 11, 2) has one chord 10-11
- (10, 11, 2, 0) has one chord 11-2
- (5, 14, 12, 9) has one chord 14-12
- (8, 3, 2, 0) has one chord 3-2
- (1, 12, 2, 0) has one chord 12-2
- (4, 13, 14, 12) has one chord 13-14

Step 3: 
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, 9, 10, 6> with the chord (9, 10).
