Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 6) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 12) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 5) (12, 14) (9, 2) (9, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 7, 10, 11)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 7, 5, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <1, (4, 7), 10, (5, 13)>
- <4, (7, 10), 11, (1, 13, 5)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Since both cycles identified have exactly one chord each, there are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
