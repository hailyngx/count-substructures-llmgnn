Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 14) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 10) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 13) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

There are several cycles in the graph, but we are interested in cycles of length 4 or more with all edges present. Here are some of the cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6-5-12-2-4-6
- Cycle 2: 6-4-2-3-6
- Cycle 3: 6-4-8-9-6
- Cycle 4: 1-3-2-4-1
- Cycle 5: 1-3-8-4-1
- Cycle 6: 1-3-11-6-1
- Cycle 7: 1-12-10-7-1
- Cycle 8: 3-2-12-10-3
- Cycle 9: 4-8-12-2-4
- Cycle 10: 4-14-7-13-4
- Cycle 11: 8-12-10-13-8
- Cycle 12: 5-12-10-1-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

After analyzing the cycles, we find that Cycle <6, (5, 12), 2, 4)> has exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

As there is only one chordal 4-cycle in the graph, the final count is [1].
