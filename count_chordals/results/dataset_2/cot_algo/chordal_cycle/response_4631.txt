Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 12) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 6) (17, 4) (17, 14) (17, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (8, 5) (8, 16) (8, 11) (8, 18) (12, 7) (12, 10) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 15) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 0) (5, 8) (5, 1) (13, 3) (13, 15) (0, 18) (0, 16) (0, 6) (15, 2) (15, 13) (15, 6) (16, 4) (16, 8) (16, 0) (16, 9) (16, 19) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (6, 15) (6, 1) (19, 16) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (9, 17) (9, 2) (9, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <4, 7, 12, 10>
- <4, 17, 14, 6>
- <4, 16, 8, 18>
- <4, 16, 0, 6>
- <4, 16, 9, 17>
- <7, 12, 10, 6>
- <14, 17, 9, 2>
- <8, 16, 0, 18>
- <8, 16, 9, 17>
- <8, 11, 1, 6>
- <8, 11, 2, 18>
- <12, 10, 6, 0>
- <2, 18, 0, 16>
- <2, 18, 8, 11>
- <2, 9, 17, 14>
- <16, 0, 6, 15>
- <16, 9, 17, 14>
- <16, 9, 2, 18>
- <1, 11, 8, 16>
- <6, 10, 12, 7>


Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
- <4, 7, 12, 10> (Chord: (7, 12))
- <4, 17, 14, 6> (Chord: (17, 14))
- <4, 16, 8, 18> (Chord: (16, 8))
- <4, 16, 0, 6> (Chord: (16, 0))
- <4, 16, 9, 17> (Chord: (16, 9))
- <7, 12, 10, 6> (Chord: (12, 10))
- <14, 17, 9, 2> (Chord: (17, 9))
- <8, 16, 0, 18> (Chord: (16, 18))
- <8, 11, 1, 6> (Chord: (11, 1))
- <2, 18, 0, 16> (Chord: (18, 16))
- <1, 11, 8, 16> (Chord: (11, 8))


Step 3: 
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the number of chordless cycles is [10].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <4, 7, 12, 10>
- <4, 17, 14, 6>
- <4, 16, 8, 18>
- <4, 16, 0, 6>
- <4, 16, 9, 17>
- <7, 12, 10, 6>
- <14, 17, 9, 2>
- <8, 16, 0, 18>
- <8, 11, 1, 6>
- <2, 18, 0, 16>
