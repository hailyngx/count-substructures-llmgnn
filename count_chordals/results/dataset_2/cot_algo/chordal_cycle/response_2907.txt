Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 0) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 1-9-12-4-2-1
        - Cycle 2: 8-0-5-9-6-12-8
        - Cycle 3: 7-13-9-6-12-4-7
        - Cycle 4: 14-2-8-0-5-10-12-14
        - Cycle 5: 13-12-4-14-13
        - Cycle 6: 3-1-9-5-0-3
        - Cycle 7: 11-2-14-4-12-10-11

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges 12 and 4)
        - Cycle 2 has no chords
        - Cycle 3 has no chords
        - Cycle 4 has exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges 5 and 10)
        - Cycle 5 has exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges 4 and 14)
        - Cycle 6 has exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges 9 and 5)
        - Cycle 7 has no chords

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        As a result, we have found 3 chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the final number is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <1, (12, 4), 2)>
        <4, (5, 10), 14)>
        <5, (9, 5), 3)>
