Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (8, 14) (8, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 10) (12, 14) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 0) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 13) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 10) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 13) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 5, 0, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 6, 5, 1)
- Cycle 3: (3, 6, 5, 0, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 6, 4, 10, 3)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 4, 0, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 0, 4, 10, 5)
- Cycle 7: (6, 4, 10, 3, 6)
- Cycle 8: (8, 14, 9, 0, 8)
- Cycle 9: (8, 14, 13, 9, 8)
- Cycle 10: (9, 13, 2, 7, 9)
- Cycle 11: (4, 6, 3, 5, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 0, 5, 10, 4)
- Cycle 13: (12, 14, 13, 9, 12)
- Cycle 14: (2, 13, 14, 8, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (3, 6), 5, 0>
- <1, (5, 6), 3, 1>
- <3, (6, 4), 10, 3>
- <5, (6, 4), 0, 5>
- <8, (14, 13), 9, 0>
- <9, (13, 2), 7, 9>
- <4, (6, 3), 5, 4>
- <4, (0, 5), 10, 4>
- <12, (14, 13), 9, 12>
- <2, (13, 14), 8, 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
