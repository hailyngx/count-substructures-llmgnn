Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 16) (17, 2) (17, 18) (1, 29) (1, 7) (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (8, 13) (8, 22) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 23) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 24) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 28) (11, 5) (11, 6) (26, 6) (29, 1) (28, 3) (28, 11) (28, 12) (28, 2) (24, 10) (24, 0) (24, 7) (2, 17) (2, 28) (2, 22) (2, 27) (2, 16) (22, 8) (22, 2) (22, 4) (22, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (25, 27) (27, 2) (27, 25) (27, 21) (27, 23) (4, 22) (4, 12) (12, 28) (12, 22) (12, 4) (15, 19) (15, 7) (15, 9) (19, 13) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 23) (0, 3) (0, 24) (0, 19) (0, 18) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 24) (7, 15) (7, 9) (21, 27) (21, 9) (16, 17) (16, 10) (16, 2) (20, 14) (20, 9) (9, 15) (9, 7) (9, 21) (9, 20) (6, 11) (6, 26) (18, 17) (18, 0) (23, 14) (23, 13) (23, 27) (23, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<0, 3, 28, 2>  
<0, 3, 7, 1>

<9, 21, 27, 2>  
<9, 21, 27, 23>  
<9, 20, 14, 10>  
<10, 14, 23, 13>  
<10, 14, 20, 9>

<23, 14, 10, 24>  
<23, 19, 13, 8>  
<23, 27, 2, 22>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:  
<0, 3, 28, 2> with chord (3, 28)  
<2, 17, 16, 10> with chord (17, 16)  
<2, 17, 18, 0> with chord (17, 18)  
<2, 28, 3, 0> with chord (28, 3)  
<2, 28, 11, 6> with chord (28, 11)  
<2, 22, 4, 12> with chord (22, 4)  
<3, 7, 1, 29> with chord (7, 1)  
<7, 1, 29, 7> with chord (1, 29)  
<7, 3, 28, 11> with chord (3, 28)  
<7, 24, 10, 11> with chord (24, 10)  
<9, 15, 19, 23> with chord (15, 19)  
<10, 14, 23, 13> with chord (14, 23)  
<10, 16, 17, 18> with chord (16, 17)  
<11, 28, 2, 22> with chord (28, 2)  
<13, 8, 22, 4> with chord (8, 22)  
<13, 23, 14, 20> with chord (23, 14)  
<16, 17, 10, 24> with chord (17, 10)  
<21, 27, 23, 19> with chord (27, 23)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
There are [18] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
