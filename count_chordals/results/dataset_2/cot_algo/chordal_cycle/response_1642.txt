- Cycle: <3, 15, 1, 11, 7>
- Cycle: <3, 17, 10, 16, 13>
- Cycle: <3, 5, 2, 18, 7>

- Cycle: <10, 16, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle: <2, 18, 16, 4, 8>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, 15, 1, 9> [Chord: (15, 1)]
- <3, 15, 1, 11> [Chord: (15, 1)]
- <3, 17, 10, 16> [Chord: (17, 10)]
- <3, 5, 2, 18> [Chord: (5, 2)]
- <3, 8, 2, 18> [Chord: (8, 2)]
- <14, 10, 16, 4> [Chord: (10, 16)]
- <6, 12, 14, 10> [Chord: (12, 14)]
- <6, 19, 4, 8> [Chord: (19, 4)]
- <9, 1, 15, 3> [Chord: (15, 3)]
- <3, 15, 1, 11, 7> [Chord: (15, 1)]
- <3, 17, 10, 16, 13> [Chord: (10, 16)]
- <3, 5, 2, 18, 7> [Chord: (5, 2)]
- <3, 8, 4, 19> [Chord: (8, 4)]
- <14, 10, 16, 4, 8> [Chord: (10, 16)]

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [11]
