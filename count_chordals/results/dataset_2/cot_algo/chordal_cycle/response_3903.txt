Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 17) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 6) (15, 13) (15, 24) (4, 22) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 25) (7, 25) (7, 11) (7, 28) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 0) (18, 15) (22, 4) (17, 3) (17, 20) (17, 21) (29, 9) (29, 6) (21, 17) (21, 28) (21, 25) (28, 7) (28, 21) (28, 0) (28, 27) (28, 13) (6, 15) (6, 29) (6, 24) (20, 17) (20, 14) (20, 16) (25, 4) (25, 7) (25, 21) (25, 27) (13, 15) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 28) (10, 19) (14, 20) (14, 8) (14, 2) (26, 2) (27, 28) (27, 25) (27, 11) (24, 15) (24, 6) (24, 5) (24, 19) (11, 7) (11, 27) (11, 0) (11, 23) (5, 24) (5, 23) (23, 11) (23, 5) (23, 12) (9, 29) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 28) (0, 11) (0, 9) (0, 19) (2, 14) (2, 26) (2, 16) (8, 14) (8, 9) (12, 23) (12, 19) (19, 10) (19, 24) (19, 0) (19, 12) (16, 20) (16, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 15, 6, 29)
- Cycle 2: (1, 13, 28, 21, 17)
- Cycle 3: (1, 13, 4, 22, 15)
- Cycle 4: (1, 13, 28, 0, 11)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 22, 15, 13)
- Cycle 6: (1, 4, 13, 15, 6)
- Cycle 7: (1, 4, 25, 7, 28)
- Cycle 8: (1, 4, 25, 21, 17)
- Cycle 9: (1, 0, 28, 7, 25)
- Cycle 10: (1, 0, 28, 21, 17)
- Cycle 11: (1, 0, 9, 29, 6)
- Cycle 12: (3, 15, 18, 17, 20)
- Cycle 13: (3, 17, 20, 14, 2)
- Cycle 14: (3, 17, 21, 25, 4)
- Cycle 15: (3, 1, 4, 22, 15)
- Cycle 16: (4, 13, 28, 27, 11)
- Cycle 17: (4, 22, 15, 13, 1)
- Cycle 18: (7, 25, 21, 17, 3)
- Cycle 19: (7, 25, 27, 11, 0)
- Cycle 20: (7, 11, 0, 28, 21)
- Cycle 21: (15, 6, 29, 9, 0)
- Cycle 22: (15, 13, 28, 27, 11)
- Cycle 23: (20, 17, 21, 25, 4)
- Cycle 24: (21, 17, 3, 1, 13)
- Cycle 25: (21, 28, 0, 11, 23)
- Cycle 26: (25, 4, 13, 28, 1)
- Cycle 27: (25, 7, 28, 0, 1)
- Cycle 28: (27, 28, 0, 1, 13)
- Cycle 29: (27, 25, 4, 13, 1)
- Cycle 30: (28, 21, 25, 7, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 15, 6, 29> (Chord: (1, 15))
- <1, 13, 28, 21, 17> (Chord: (13, 21))
- <1, 13, 4, 22, 15> (Chord: (4, 15))
- <1, 13, 28, 0, 11> (Chord: (13, 0))
- <1, 4, 25, 7, 28> (Chord: (4, 7))
- <4, 13, 28, 27, 11> (Chord: (13, 27))
- <7, 25, 21, 17, 3> (Chord: (25, 17))
- <15, 6, 29, 9, 0> (Chord: (6, 9))
- <20, 17, 21, 25, 4> (Chord: (17, 25))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 9 chordless cycles, so the final answer is [9].
