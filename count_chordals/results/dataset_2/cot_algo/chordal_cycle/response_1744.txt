Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 3, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 0, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (3, 2, 4, 5, 3)
- Cycle 4: (8, 1, 7, 5, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Checking Cycle 1: (5, 6) is the chord
- Checking Cycle 2: (5, 9) is the chord
- Checking Cycle 3: No chord found
- Checking Cycle 4: (8, 5) is the chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There is 1 chordal 4-cycle in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (8, 5), 7>
