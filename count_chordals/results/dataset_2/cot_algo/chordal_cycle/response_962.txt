Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-3-7-6-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-1-2-6-0
        - Cycle 3: 0-1-5-6-0
        - Cycle 4: 0-1-7-6-0
        - Cycle 5: 1-2-6-5-1
        - Cycle 6: 1-2-8-6-1
        - Cycle 7: 0-6-7-1-0
        - Cycle 8: 0-6-2-1-0

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <0, 3, 7, 6> has no chord.
        - <0, 1, 2, 6> has no chord.
        - <0, 1, 5, 6> has no chord.
        - <0, 1, 7, 6> has no chord.
        - <1, 2, 6, 5> has chord (1, 5).
        - <1, 2, 8, 6> has chord (2, 8).
        - <0, 6, 7, 1> has chord (6, 7).
        - <0, 6, 2, 1> has chord (6, 2).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal cycles found: 
        - There are 4 chordless cycles found.

Putting the final number inside brackets: [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        - <0, 1, 2, 6, (1, 5)>
        - <0, 1, 7, 6, (2, 8)>
        - <0, 6, 7, 1, (6, 7)>
        - <0, 6, 2, 1, (6, 2)>
