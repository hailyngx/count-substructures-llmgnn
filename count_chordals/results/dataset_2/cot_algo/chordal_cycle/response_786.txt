Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 2) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 16) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (10, 17) (10, 6) (10, 18) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 16) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 14) (4, 16) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 18) (18, 10) (18, 8) (18, 7) (2, 3) (2, 15) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 13) (0, 7) (0, 16) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 13) (13, 2) (13, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 6) (16, 5) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 7) (12, 3) (12, 5) (19, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 1, 7, 0, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 2, 8, 18, 10, 6, 1, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 2, 1, 6, 10, 17, 11, 7, 0, 16, 3)
- Cycle 4: (15, 2, 3, 12, 5, 16, 17, 10, 6, 1, 2, 15)
- Cycle 5: (15, 2, 1, 6, 7, 11, 17, 16, 5, 12, 3, 15)
- Cycle 6: (5, 4, 16, 17, 11, 7, 1, 6, 10, 18, 8, 2, 5)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 18, 10, 17, 16, 5, 12, 3, 1, 6, 11, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (3, 1, 7, 0, 3) -> Chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 2: (3, 2, 8, 18, 10, 6, 1, 3) -> Chord: (2, 8)
- Cycle 3: (3, 2, 1, 6, 10, 17, 11, 7, 0, 16, 3) -> Chord: (1, 10)
- Cycle 4: (15, 2, 3, 12, 5, 16, 17, 10, 6, 1, 2, 15) -> Chord: (2, 10)
- Cycle 5: (15, 2, 1, 6, 7, 11, 17, 16, 5, 12, 3, 15) -> Chord: (2, 11)
- Cycle 6: (5, 4, 16, 17, 11, 7, 1, 6, 10, 18, 8, 2, 5) -> Chord: (4, 16)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 18, 10, 17, 16, 5, 12, 3, 1, 6, 11, 4) -> Chord: (8, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the final count is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (1, 7), 3, 0>
- <2, (2, 8), 3, 18>
- <3, (1, 10), 16, 2>
- <15, (2, 10), 5, 17>
- <15, (2, 11), 16, 12>
- <5, (4, 16), 2, 8>
- <4, (8, 12), 3, 5>
