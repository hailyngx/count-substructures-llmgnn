Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 3 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 2: 4 - 1 - 3 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 3: 4 - 5 - 3 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 4: 4 - 8 - 3 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 5: 1 - 3 - 7 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 9 - 3 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 7: 3 - 5 - 7 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 8: 3 - 8 - 7 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 9: 8 - 2 - 6 - 5 - 8
- Cycle 10: 2 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 2

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (7, 1)
- Cycle 2 has one chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 3 has one chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 4 has one chord (8, 3)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<4, (7, 1), 3>
<4, (1, 7), 3>
<4, (5, 7), 3>
<4, (8, 3), 7>
<7, (0, 3), 1>
<8, (2, 6), 5>
