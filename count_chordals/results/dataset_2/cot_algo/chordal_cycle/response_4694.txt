Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 28) (11, 22) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 18) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 24) (7, 26) (14, 17) (14, 19) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 26) (8, 25) (8, 0) (8, 26) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 27) (12, 25) (12, 15) (12, 9) (28, 11) (28, 19) (5, 21) (5, 27) (13, 21) (20, 23) (20, 22) (0, 16) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 19) (1, 17) (1, 19) (25, 8) (25, 12) (25, 27) (25, 29) (27, 23) (27, 5) (27, 25) (15, 12) (15, 2) (15, 24) (19, 14) (19, 28) (19, 0) (19, 1) (21, 5) (21, 13) (21, 9) (21, 18) (21, 2) (6, 23) (6, 29) (3, 4) (3, 24) (3, 22) (24, 7) (24, 15) (24, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 21) (29, 14) (29, 25) (29, 6) (29, 26) (26, 7) (26, 17) (26, 8) (26, 29) (22, 11) (22, 20) (22, 3) (10, 18) (18, 16) (18, 21) (18, 10) (2, 15) (2, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 18, 21) 
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 0, 9) 
- Cycle 3: (14, 17, 1, 19) 
- Cycle 4: (8, 25, 27, 29) 
- Cycle 5: (23, 6, 29, 26) 
- Cycle 6: (12, 25, 27, 5) 
- Cycle 7: (28, 11, 22, 20) 
- Cycle 8: (13, 21, 18, 10) 
- Cycle 9: (15, 12, 25, 8) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle). 

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
<11, 16, 18, 21> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 8 chordless cycles found, so the final answer is [8].
