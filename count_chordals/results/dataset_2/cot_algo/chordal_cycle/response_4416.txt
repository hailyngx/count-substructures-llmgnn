Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 5 - 1 - 0
        - Cycle 2: 0 - 4 - 5 - 7 - 0
        - Cycle 3: 0 - 3 - 9 - 1 - 0
        - Cycle 4: 0 - 3 - 9 - 2 - 0
        - Cycle 5: 3 - 4 - 5 - 7 - 3
        - Cycle 6: 3 - 4 - 5 - 8 - 3
        - Cycle 7: 1 - 5 - 8 - 6 - 1
        - Cycle 8: 1 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 1
        - Cycle 9: 1 - 5 - 4 - 0 - 1
        - Cycle 10: 1 - 7 - 8 - 6 - 1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - <0, (4, 5), 1> has a chord (4, 5)
        - <0, (4, 5), 7> has a chord (4, 5)
        - <0, (3, 9), 1> has a chord (3, 9)
        - <0, (3, 9), 2> has a chord (3, 9)
        - <3, (4, 5), 7> has a chord (4, 5)
        - <3, (4, 5), 8> has a chord (4, 5)
        - <1, (5, 8), 6> has a chord (5, 8)
        - <1, (5, 8), 7> has a chord (5, 8)
        - <1, (4, 5), 0> has a chord (4, 5)
        - <1, (6, 8), 7> has a chord (6, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
