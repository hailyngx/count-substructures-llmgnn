- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 1, 8, 27> with chord (1, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 6, 2, 25> with chord (6, 25)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 8, 27, 10> with chord (8, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 6, 3, 21> with chord (6, 21)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 9, 23, 12> with chord (9, 23)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 21, 22, 20> with chord (21, 22)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- The total number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [14].
