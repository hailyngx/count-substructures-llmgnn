Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

There are several cycles of length 4 or more found in the graph:
1. Cycle 1: 0-5-9-4
2. Cycle 2: 0-6-2-3
3. Cycle 3: 1-7-8-9
4. Cycle 4: 1-2-4-3
5. Cycle 5: 2-4-9-1
6. Cycle 6: 2-6-8-1
7. Cycle 7: 3-8-9-5
8. Cycle 8: 4-9-8-7
9. Cycle 9: 6-8-7-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

After checking each cycle, we find that there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <0, (5, 9), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless cycles found in the graph is [9].
