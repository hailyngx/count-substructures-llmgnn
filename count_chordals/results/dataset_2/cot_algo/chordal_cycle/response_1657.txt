Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2: 
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3: 
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is 0, so the final count is [0].
