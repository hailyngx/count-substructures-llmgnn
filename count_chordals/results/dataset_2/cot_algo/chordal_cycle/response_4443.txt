- Cycle 1: (1, 23, 16, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 23, 16, 12, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 23, 6, 15, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 23, 6, 18, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 7, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 7, 3, 10, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 7, 20, 29, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 7, 20, 29, 16, 2, 27, 24, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 25, 14, 4, 5, 3, 10, 4, 14, 25, 1)
- Cycle 10: (2, 16, 23, 1, 25, 14, 4, 5, 3, 7, 20, 29, 16, 12, 2)
