Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 13) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 12) (4, 13) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 7) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 3, 11, 14, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 3, 8, 1, 10>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 5, 7, 14, 11>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 5, 7, 14, 3>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 5, 4, 10, 13>
- Cycle 6: <0, 6, 5, 4, 12, 8>
- Cycle 7: <5, 9, 6, 3, 11, 14>
- Cycle 8: <5, 9, 6, 3, 8, 1>
- Cycle 9: <5, 9, 6, 0, 7, 14>
- Cycle 10: <5, 9, 6, 0, 13, 10>
- Cycle 11: <5, 9, 6, 0, 13, 7>
- Cycle 12: <5, 9, 6, 5, 7, 14>
- Cycle 13: <5, 9, 11, 3, 8, 1>
- Cycle 14: <5, 9, 11, 3, 12, 4>
- Cycle 15: <5, 9, 11, 14, 7, 1>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: <0, 6, (5), 7>
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <0, 6, (3), 8>
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <0, (6), 5, 7>
- Cycle 4 has a chord: <0, 6, (5), 7>
- Cycle 5 is chordal: <0, (6), 5, 4>
- Cycle 6 is chordal: <0, (6), 5, 4>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <5, 9, (6), 3>
- Cycle 8 has a chord: <5, 9, (6), 3>
- Cycle 9 is chordal: <5, (9), 6, 0>
- Cycle 10 has a chord: <5, 9, (6), 0>
- Cycle 11 has a chord: <5, 9, (6), 0>
- Cycle 12 has a chord: <5, 9, (6), 5>
- Cycle 13 has a chord: <5, 9, (11), 3>
- Cycle 14 has a chord: <5, 9, (11), 3>
- Cycle 15 has a chord: <5, 9, (11), 14>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 6, (5), 7>
<0, 6, (3), 8>
<0, (6), 5, 4>
<5, (9), 6, 0>
<5, 9, (6), 0>
<5, 9, (11), 3>
