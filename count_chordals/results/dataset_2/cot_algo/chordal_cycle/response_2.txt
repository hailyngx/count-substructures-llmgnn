Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 0) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 7) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (6, 9, 7, 1, 6)
        - Cycle 2: (6, 11, 3, 10, 6)
        - Cycle 3: (6, 13, 5, 10, 6)
        - Cycle 4: (9, 4, 12, 1, 9)
        - Cycle 5: (9, 7, 0, 3, 9)
        - Cycle 6: (1, 7, 0, 3, 1)
        - Cycle 7: (3, 11, 6, 13, 3)
        - Cycle 8: (3, 10, 5, 13, 3)
        - Cycle 9: (10, 11, 12, 4, 10)
        - Cycle 10: (10, 5, 7, 1, 10)
        - Cycle 11: (11, 12, 8, 3, 11)
        - Cycle 12: (4, 12, 14, 6, 4)
        - Cycle 13: (8, 12, 1, 7, 8)
        - Cycle 14: (8, 14, 10, 5, 8)
        - Cycle 15: (5, 7, 0, 13, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Cycle 2 <(10, 3)>
        - Cycle 3 <(10, 6)>
        - Cycle 5 <(9, 3)>
        - Cycle 6 <(7, 3)>
        - Cycle 8 <(5, 3)>
        - Cycle 10 <(1, 10)>
        - Cycle 11 <(12, 11)>
        - Cycle 12 <(4, 6)>
        - Cycle 13 <(1, 12)>
        - Cycle 14 <(14, 8)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [10].
