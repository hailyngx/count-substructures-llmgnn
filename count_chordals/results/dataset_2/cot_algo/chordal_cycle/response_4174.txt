<1, 22, 0, 3>
<1, 22, 19, 13>
<1, 22, 20, 8>
<1, 25, 9, 14>
<2, 17, 16, 24>
<3, 0, 11, 28>
<3, 5, 13, 19>
<3, 5, 13, 21>
<3, 7, 26, 18>
<3, 29, 26, 6>
<4, 1, 22, 19>
<5, 3, 0, 11>
<5, 13, 21, 16>
<6, 10, 9, 14>
<6, 26, 29, 18>
<7, 3, 0, 22>
<8, 24, 16, 21>
<9, 10, 28, 14>
<9, 14, 21, 15>
<10, 6, 26, 29>
<10, 28, 11, 0>
<11, 0, 3, 5>
<12, 22, 19, 13>
<13, 5, 3, 0>
<13, 19, 22, 1>
<13, 19, 20, 8>
<13, 27, 6, 26>
<14, 9, 10, 6>
<14, 21, 16, 17>
<15, 18, 26, 29>
<15, 20, 1, 22>
<15, 21, 13, 19>
<15, 23, 22, 19>
<16, 17, 2, 24>
<16, 21, 13, 19>
<16, 21, 15, 18>
<16, 24, 19, 22>
<17, 16, 21, 15>
<18, 15, 21, 13>
<18, 23, 22, 1>
<18, 26, 29, 3>
<18, 29, 3, 0>
<19, 13, 5, 3>
<19, 14, 9, 10>
<19, 22, 0, 3>
<19, 24, 8, 20>
<20, 8, 24, 2>
<20, 15, 23, 22>
<20, 19, 22, 1>
<20, 19, 13, 5>
<21, 13, 19, 24>
<21, 14, 9, 10>
<21, 15, 23, 22>
<21, 16, 17, 2>
<22, 1, 25, 9>
<22, 19, 24, 16>
<22, 19, 13, 5>
<22, 23, 18, 26>
<23, 18, 26, 6>
<24, 16, 21, 13>
<24, 19, 22, 1>
<24, 2, 17, 16>
<24, 8, 20, 1>
<25, 1, 22, 19>
<25, 9, 14, 21>
<26, 6, 10, 9>
<26, 18, 29, 3>
<26, 29, 3, 5>
<26, 29, 18, 15>
<27, 6, 26, 18>
<27, 13, 5, 3>
<28, 10, 9, 14>
<28, 11, 0, 22>
<28, 14, 21, 15>
<29, 3, 0, 11>
<29, 18, 23, 15>
<29, 26, 6, 10>


Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<0, 22, 1, 4> (Chord: 1-22)
<9, 10, 28, 14> (Chord: 10-14)
<10, 6, 26, 29> (Chord: 6-26)
<13, 5, 3, 0> (Chord: 0-3)
<14, 9, 10, 6> (Chord: 9-10)
<15, 18, 26, 29> (Chord: 18-26)
<16, 17, 2, 24> (Chord: 17-24)
<21, 14, 9, 10> (Chord: 9-10)
<22, 1, 25, 9> (Chord: 1-9)

Step 3: 
It seems that none of the cycles have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles found is: [0].
