Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 6) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 8) (17, 29) (17, 21) (17, 7) (29, 17) (29, 6) (29, 25) (29, 14) (6, 18) (6, 29) (6, 21) (6, 14) (28, 22) (28, 12) (28, 27) (28, 19) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 7) (26, 5) (24, 15) (24, 21) (0, 16) (0, 12) (7, 17) (7, 13) (7, 27) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 24) (21, 9) (1, 2) (1, 25) (15, 24) (15, 25) (8, 22) (8, 19) (8, 27) (19, 28) (19, 8) (19, 9) (14, 29) (14, 6) (14, 9) (16, 0) (16, 25) (16, 10) (4, 13) (4, 3) (5, 26) (5, 10) (3, 4) (3, 20) (3, 12) (2, 1) (2, 27) (2, 20) (12, 28) (12, 0) (12, 3) (12, 20) (20, 3) (20, 2) (20, 12) (20, 27) (20, 11) (23, 25) (23, 10) (25, 29) (25, 1) (25, 15) (25, 16) (25, 23) (9, 21) (9, 19) (9, 14) (27, 28) (27, 7) (27, 8) (27, 2) (27, 20) (11, 13) (11, 20) (10, 16) (10, 5) (10, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle with 4 nodes: (21, 6, 29, 14)
2. Cycle with 4 nodes: (12, 28, 22, 8)
3. Cycle with 4 nodes: (25, 29, 14, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

1. Cycle with 4 nodes (21, 6, 29, 14) has one chord (6, 29): <(6, 29), 21>
2. Cycle with 4 nodes (12, 28, 22, 8) has one chord (28, 8): <(28, 8), 12>
3. Cycle with 4 nodes (25, 29, 14, 6) has one chord (29, 6): <(29, 6), 25>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As there are no chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord) found, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
