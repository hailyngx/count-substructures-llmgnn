Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2)

- Cycle 5: (6, 7, 2, 9, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 7, 2, 1, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 7, 9, 1, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 7, 9, 0, 6)
- Cycle 9: (1, 9, 2, 7, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 9, 2, 0, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 9, 0, 6, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 9, 0, 3, 1)
- Cycle 13: (3, 5, 7, 9, 3)
- Cycle 14: (3, 5, 7, 6, 3)
- Cycle 15: (4, 6, 0, 3, 4)

- Cycle 20: (8, 6, 0, 4, 8)
- Cycle 21: (8, 6, 9, 1, 8)
- Cycle 22: (8, 6, 9, 5, 8)
- Cycle 23: (0, 9, 1, 2, 0)
- Cycle 24: (0, 9, 1, 3, 0)
- Cycle 25: (0, 9, 2, 7, 0)
- Cycle 26: (0, 9, 2, 1, 0)
- Cycle 27: (0, 6, 7, 2, 0)
- Cycle 28: (0, 6, 7, 9, 0)
- Cycle 29: (0, 6, 8, 1, 0)
- Cycle 30: (0, 3, 5, 7, 0)
- Cycle 31: (0, 3, 5, 9, 0)
- Cycle 32: (2, 9, 1, 8, 2)
- Cycle 33: (2, 9, 1, 3, 2)
- Cycle 34: (2, 9, 7, 5, 2)
- Cycle 35: (2, 9, 7, 6, 2)
- Cycle 36: (2, 1, 9, 0, 2)
- Cycle 37: (2, 1, 9, 6, 2)
- Cycle 38: (2, 1, 8, 6, 2)
- Cycle 39: (7, 5, 3, 1, 7)
- Cycle 40: (7, 5, 3, 0, 7)
- Cycle 41: (7, 5, 9, 0, 7)
- Cycle 42: (7, 5, 9, 6, 7)
- Cycle 43: (7, 2, 1, 8, 7)
- Cycle 44: (7, 2, 1, 9, 7)
- Cycle 45: (7, 2, 9, 5, 7)
- Cycle 46: (7, 6, 9, 0, 7)
- Cycle 47: (7, 6, 9, 1, 7)
- Cycle 48: (7, 6, 8, 1, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (2, 7), 9>
- <2, (1, 9), 0>
- <6, (7, 9), 8>
- <6, (7, 9), 4>
- <6, (7, 2), 1>
- <6, (7, 9), 0>
- <1, (9, 2), 7>
- <1, (9, 2), 0>
- <1, (9, 0), 6>
- <1, (9, 0), 3>
- <4, (6, 0), 8>
- <8, (6, 0), 4>
- <0, (9, 1), 2>
- <0, (9, 1), 3>
- <2, (9, 7), 5>
- <2, (9, 7), 6>
- <7, (5, 3), 1>
- <7, (5, 3), 0>
- <7, (5, 9), 0>
- <7, (5, 9), 6>
- <7, (2, 1), 8>
- <7, (2, 1), 9>
- <7, (2, 9), 5>
- <7, (6, 9), 0>
- <7, (6, 9), 1>
- <7, (6, 8), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 27 unique chordal 4-cycles. Thus, the final count is [27].
