Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (7, 21, 15, 4, 16)
        - Cycle 2: (7, 21, 15, 18, 10)
        - Cycle 3: (10, 17, 28, 16, 4)
        - Cycle 4: (10, 17, 28, 5, 18)
        - Cycle 5: (10, 17, 19, 25, 6)
        - Cycle 6: (10, 26, 24, 12, 4)
        - Cycle 7: (17, 28, 16, 0, 9)
        - Cycle 8: (17, 19, 25, 6, 11)
        - Cycle 9: (17, 19, 25, 7, 21)
        - Cycle 10: (17, 19, 18, 15, 4)
        - Cycle 11: (17, 19, 18, 5, 28)
        - Cycle 12: (8, 2, 13, 11, 6)
        - Cycle 13: (8, 23, 2, 13, 11)
        - Cycle 14: (8, 14, 3, 1, 10)
        - Cycle 15: (23, 2, 13, 11, 6)
        - Cycle 16: (26, 13, 11, 6, 25)
        - Cycle 17: (26, 13, 2, 7, 21)
        - Cycle 18: (26, 20, 22, 27, 6)
        - Cycle 19: (26, 20, 22, 6, 25)
        - Cycle 20: (26, 24, 12, 4, 15)
        - Cycle 21: (16, 28, 5, 18, 15)
        - Cycle 22: (16, 4, 15, 18, 5)
        - Cycle 23: (16, 0, 9, 20, 22)
        - Cycle 24: (16, 0, 9, 20, 26)
        - Cycle 25: (19, 18, 15, 5, 28)
        - Cycle 26: (19, 18, 5, 28, 17)
        - Cycle 27: (13, 11, 6, 25, 7)
        - Cycle 28: (13, 2, 7, 21, 15)
        - Cycle 29: (24, 12, 4, 15, 18)
        - Cycle 30: (25, 6, 22, 20, 26)

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
        - Only Cycle 19: (26, 20, 22, 6, 25) has exactly one chord: (20, 22) 
        - Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <26, 20, 22, 6, 25>
