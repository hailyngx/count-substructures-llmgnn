Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 15) (13, 14) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 0) (1, 21) (1, 11) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 8) (21, 1) (21, 7) (21, 15) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 27) (29, 5) (29, 18) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 18) (23, 22) (23, 11) (23, 15) (23, 4) (0, 22) (0, 1) (20, 27) (20, 4) (24, 26) (24, 12) (11, 1) (11, 23) (11, 28) (28, 11) (28, 19) (26, 24) (17, 8) (17, 27) (25, 2) (8, 1) (8, 17) (8, 15) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 3) (3, 9) (5, 22) (5, 29) (5, 10) (27, 29) (27, 20) (27, 17) (27, 19) (27, 6) (14, 13) (14, 22) (14, 15) (19, 2) (19, 7) (19, 28) (19, 27) (15, 13) (15, 21) (15, 23) (15, 8) (15, 14) (6, 13) (6, 27) (6, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 12) (16, 9) (16, 4) (12, 1) (12, 24) (12, 10) (18, 29) (18, 7) (4, 23) (4, 20) (4, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 3-9-16-4-3
- Cycle 2: 7-19-28-11-7
- Cycle 3: 21-1-12-24-26-20-27-21
- Cycle 4: 15-21-1-8-15
- Cycle 5: 15-14-22-13-15
- Cycle 6: 15-8-17-27-20-4-16-15

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the following two cycles are chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <15, (8, 21), 1, 15> with chord 8-21
- <15, (14, 22), 13, 15> with chord 14-22

Step 3:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2]. 

Note: The chords are specified within parentheses and the unique chordal 4-cycles are listed inside <> each only once.
