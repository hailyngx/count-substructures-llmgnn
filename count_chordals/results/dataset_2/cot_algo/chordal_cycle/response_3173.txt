Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 8) (14, 18) (14, 9) (14, 4) (4, 14) (4, 18) (4, 11) (18, 14) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 16) (18, 17) (7, 16) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 13) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 1) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (12, 5) (12, 19) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 17) (19, 7) (19, 12) (19, 15) (19, 11) (11, 4) (11, 19) (11, 17) (3, 2) (3, 13) (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 17) (5, 10) (8, 0) (8, 15) (17, 18) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 13) (9, 14) (9, 1) (1, 16) (1, 9) (10, 2) (10, 5) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles with length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- Cycle 1: 2-6-7-16-2
- Cycle 2: 5-10-2-6-5

Step 2: 
Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 (2-6-7-16-2) has a chord (7, 16) connecting non-adjacent nodes 2 and 7.
- Cycle 2 (5-10-2-6-5) has a chord (2, 6) connecting non-adjacent nodes 5 and 2.

Step 3: 
Both cycles found have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <2, 5, 10, 6>
