Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 13) (1, 2) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 7) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 11) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
<5, 7, 8, 11>, <5, 14, 10, 0>, <5, 14, 11, 4>, <5, 14, 7, 13>, 
<9, 6, 2, 1>, <9, 6, 12, 3>, <9, 6, 13, 7>, <9, 11, 8, 7>, 
<6, 14, 11, 4>, <6, 14, 7, 13>, <6, 2, 3, 12>, <6, 2, 10, 14>, <6, 12, 1, 2>, <6, 13, 3, 12>, <6, 13, 7, 0>, 
<1, 12, 3, 4>, <1, 12, 7, 14>, 
<3, 13, 0, 10>, <3, 13, 7, 12>, <3, 2, 1, 12>, <3, 2, 11, 4>, <3, 12, 6, 2>, <3, 12, 7, 14>, 
<10, 0, 4, 11>, <10, 2, 3, 12>, <10, 2, 11, 14>, 
<11, 8, 7, 5>, 
<4, 11, 8, 7>, <4, 0, 13, 3>, 
<8, 7, 5, 14>, 
<7, 12, 1, 2>, <7, 12, 3, 4>, 
<12, 6, 13, 0>, 

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is <9, 6, 2, 1>, with a chord between nodes 9 and 2. 

Step 3:
There is [1] chordal 4-cycle found in the graph.
