Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 2) (7, 19) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 8) (0, 12) (0, 14) (0, 18) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 15) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 17) (13, 4) (13, 10) (13, 18) (11, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 18) (15, 14) (15, 9) (8, 12) (8, 5) (8, 9) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 8) (18, 0) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 19) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 6) (6, 19) (6, 17) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 17) (4, 16) (16, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-12-10-13-4-1-3-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-12-10-13-18-0
- Cycle 3: 0-12-10-18-0
- Cycle 4: 0-14-15-9-11-12-10-13-18-0
- Cycle 5: 0-14-15-9-11-5-4-1-3-2-0
- Cycle 6: 0-14-7-19-18-13-4-1-3-2-0
- Cycle 7: 3-1-4-13-10-12-11-5-17-3
- Cycle 8: 4-13-10-12-11-5-17-6-19-18-0

Step 2:

- Cycle 3: 0-14-7-19-18-13-4-1-3-2-0, Chord: (13, 3)
- Cycle 4: 3-1-4-13-10-12-11-5-17-3, Chord: (17, 5)
- Cycle 5: 4-13-10-12-11-5-17-6-19-18-0, Chord: (12, 6)

Step 3:
Count of unique chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 12, 10, 13>
- <0, 14, 15, 9>
- <0, 14, 7, 19>
- <3, 1, 4, 13>
- <4, 13, 10, 12, 11>
