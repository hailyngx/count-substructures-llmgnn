Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 22) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 11) (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 25) (9, 6) (22, 4) (22, 23) (22, 29) (22, 25) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 21) (23, 16) (23, 0) (21, 23) (21, 20) (21, 18) (21, 24) (28, 26) (28, 20) (26, 28) (26, 2) (26, 3) (0, 23) (3, 7) (3, 26) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 17) (5, 23) (5, 24) (17, 6) (17, 11) (17, 2) (15, 25) (2, 4) (2, 26) (2, 17) (2, 10) (2, 25) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 29) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 20) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 16) (20, 21) (20, 28) (20, 14) (12, 29) (12, 1) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 24) (18, 21) (18, 1) (27, 10) (16, 23) (16, 19) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 12) (29, 24) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 10) (1, 18) (25, 6) (25, 22) (25, 15) (25, 2) (13, 11) (13, 19) (24, 21) (24, 5) (24, 10) (24, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 26 - 3 - 7 - 11 - 26
- Cycle 2: 2 - 4 - 22 - 23 - 2
- Cycle 3: 21 - 23 - 5 - 24 - 21
- Cycle 4: 1 - 14 - 8 - 29 - 1
- Cycle 5: 27 - 10 - 2 - 26 - 27
- Cycle 6: 18 - 1 - 12 - 29 - 18

Step 2:
Let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <26, (3, 11), 7>
- Cycle 2: <2, (4, 23), 22>
- Cycle 3: <21, (23, 24), 5>
- Cycle 4: <1, (14, 29), 8>
- Cycle 5: <27, (10, 26), 2>
- Cycle 6: <18, (1, 29), 12>

Step 3:
After checking all cycles, we have found 6 unique chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the final count is [6].
