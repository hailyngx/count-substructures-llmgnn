Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 17) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 14) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (15, 11) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 5) (19, 18) (19, 15) (19, 17) (19, 6) (0, 16) (0, 4) (0, 10) (6, 1) (6, 19) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 18) (3, 8) (3, 18) (3, 2) (14, 12) (14, 10) (14, 5) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 19) (17, 2) (5, 7) (5, 15) (5, 14) (2, 3) (2, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (4, 11, 15, 1, 6) with edges: (4, 11), (11, 15), (15, 1), (1, 6), (6, 4)
- Cycle 2: (7, 4, 11, 15, 19) with edges: (7, 4), (4, 11), (11, 15), (15, 19), (19, 7)
- Cycle 3: (8, 10, 0, 4, 7) with edges: (8, 10), (10, 0), (0, 4), (4, 7), (7, 8)
- Cycle 4: (12, 13, 8, 10, 14) with edges: (12, 13), (13, 8), (8, 10), (10, 14), (14, 12)
- Cycle 5: (12, 17, 16, 0, 4) with edges: (12, 17), (17, 16), (16, 0), (0, 4), (4, 12)
- Cycle 6: (13, 8, 3, 18, 19) with edges: (13, 8), (8, 3), (3, 18), (18, 19), (19, 13)
- Cycle 7: (3, 8, 10, 0, 16) with edges: (3, 8), (8, 10), (10, 0), (0, 16), (16, 3)
- Cycle 8: (14, 10, 0, 4, 11) with edges: (14, 10), (10, 0), (0, 4), (4, 11), (11, 14)
- Cycle 9: (17, 16, 0, 10, 14) with edges: (17, 16), (16, 0), (0, 10), (10, 14), (14, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
- <4, 11, 15, 1> with chord (6, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are a total of [8] chordless cycles.
