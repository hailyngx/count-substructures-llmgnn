Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph. 
1. Cycle 1: 1-5-3-1
2. Cycle 2: 1-5-4-1
3. Cycle 3: 1-9-7-1
4. Cycle 4: 1-6-4-1
5. Cycle 5: 1-6-7-1
... (additional cycles continue)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 1 has no chords.
2. Cycle 2 has a chord: (5, 4)
3. Cycle 3 has a chord: (9, 7)
4. Cycle 4 has no chords.
5. Cycle 5 has a chord: (6, 7)
... (additional cycles continue)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final count is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <1, 5, 4, 1> with a chord (5, 4)
2. <1, 9, 7, 1> with a chord (9, 7)
