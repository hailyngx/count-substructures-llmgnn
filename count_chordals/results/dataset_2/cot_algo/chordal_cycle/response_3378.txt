Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-9-6-4-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-9-6-8-0
        - Cycle 3: 0-2-1-8-0
        - Cycle 4: 7-1-2-4-7
        - Cycle 5: 7-1-3-8-7
        - Cycle 6: 7-0-2-4-7
        - Cycle 7: 7-0-3-8-7
        - Cycle 8: 8-1-2-7-8
        - Cycle 9: 8-1-3-7-8
        - Cycle 10: 8-0-2-7-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <0, 6, 4, 9> has one chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 2 <0, 6, 8, 9> has one chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 3 <0, 1, 8, 2> has one chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 4 <2, 7, 1, 4> has one chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 5 <7, 3, 1, 8> has one chord: (3, 8)
- Cycle 6 <0, 2, 4, 7> has one chord: (2, 4)
- Cycle 7 <0, 3, 7, 8> has one chord: (3, 8)
- Cycle 8 <2, 8, 1, 7> has one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 9 <3, 8, 1, 7> has one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 10 <0, 8, 2, 7> has one chord: (2, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
