Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 0) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 2, 5>
2. Cycle <5, 8, 2, 5>
3. Cycle <5, 11, 6, 0>
4. Cycle <9, 2, 3, 7>
5. Cycle <9, 1, 14, 6>
6. Cycle <4, 7, 3, 2>
7. Cycle <4, 8, 5, 2>
8. Cycle <7, 3, 10, 13>
9. Cycle <7, 6, 11, 0>
10. Cycle <8, 5, 10, 13>
11. Cycle <8, 2, 3, 7>
12. Cycle <2, 3, 7, 4>
13. Cycle <13, 1, 12, 11>
14. Cycle <1, 14, 7, 4>
15. Cycle <6, 14, 1, 9>
16. Cycle <12, 1, 13, 9>
17. Cycle <3, 7, 4, 8>
18. Cycle <14, 1, 9, 5>
19. Cycle <10, 13, 9, 5>
20. Cycle <0, 6, 11, 5>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes) are:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 2, 5> with chord (9, 2)
2. Cycle <5, 8, 2, 5> with chord (8, 2)
3. Cycle <5, 11, 6, 0> with chord (11, 6)
4. Cycle <9, 2, 3, 7> with chord (2, 3)
5. Cycle <9, 1, 14, 6> with chord (1, 6)
6. Cycle <4, 8, 5, 2> with chord (8, 5)
7. Cycle <10, 13, 9, 5> with chord (13, 9)

Step 3:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final answer is [7].
