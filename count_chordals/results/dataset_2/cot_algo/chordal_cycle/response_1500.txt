Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 14) (16, 10) (3, 15) (3, 1) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 5) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 7) (8, 11) (8, 19) (13, 15) (13, 9) (13, 14) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (17, 19) (17, 18) (5, 15) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 0) (4, 10) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 0) (18, 17) (18, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 0) (19, 8) (19, 17) (19, 4) (19, 9) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 13) (12, 10) (2, 0) (9, 11) (9, 15) (9, 13) (9, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 11-16-14-1-11
- Cycle 2: 11-14-13-9-11
- Cycle 3: 11-8-19-17-11
- Cycle 4: 3-15-13-14-3
- Cycle 5: 3-1-7-10-3
- Cycle 6: 16-10-4-18-16
- Cycle 7: 16-14-13-9-16
- Cycle 8: 15-9-13-14-15
- Cycle 9: 15-5-7-0-15
- Cycle 10: 1-7-10-4-1
- Cycle 11: 8-19-17-18-8
- Cycle 12: 13-14-1-7-13
- Cycle 13: 10-4-0-6-10
- Cycle 14: 0-5-7-1-0
- Cycle 15: 0-6-0
- Cycle 16: 0-4-18-17-0
- Cycle 17: 0-7-1-14-0
- Cycle 18: 19-9-13-15-19

Step 2:
Identifying unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <11, 14, 9, 16> has a chord.
- <13, 14, 15, 9> has a chord.
- <8, 11, 17, 19> has a chord.

Step 3:
Number of chordless 4-cycles = [15]
