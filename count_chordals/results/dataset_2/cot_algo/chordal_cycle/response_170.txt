Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 1) (15, 23) (15, 5) (27, 15) (27, 17) (27, 13) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 1) (29, 2) (29, 0) (29, 3) (1, 15) (1, 2) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 28) (7, 23) (7, 8) (12, 21) (12, 11) (9, 22) (9, 8) (9, 21) (9, 0) (9, 19) (22, 9) (22, 11) (22, 10) (22, 20) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 23) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 14) (13, 27) (13, 25) (13, 4) (17, 27) (17, 6) (17, 24) (17, 21) (3, 29) (3, 28) (0, 29) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 6) (10, 22) (10, 5) (10, 25) (16, 20) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 24) (6, 14) (24, 17) (24, 6) (24, 14) (24, 25) (11, 12) (11, 22) (5, 15) (5, 2) (5, 10) (4, 13) (4, 23) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 24) (23, 15) (23, 7) (23, 28) (23, 4) (23, 19) (19, 9) (19, 23) (25, 13) (25, 10) (25, 24) (21, 12) (21, 9) (21, 17) (21, 18) (18, 0) (18, 21) (20, 22) (20, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: {1, 2, 29, 0, 1}
- Cycle 2: {1, 26, 28, 3, 1}
- Cycle 3: {1, 26, 28, 23, 7, 8, 14, 6, 0, 29, 2, 1}
- Cycle 4: {1, 26, 28, 23, 19, 9, 22, 10, 5, 15, 27, 17, 21, 12, 11, 22, 20, 16, 20, 22, 11, 12, 21, 17, 27, 15, 1}

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has one chord: Chord 15-17.

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles = 3, so the answer is [3].
Unique chordal 4-cycle: <15, 17, 21, 27>
