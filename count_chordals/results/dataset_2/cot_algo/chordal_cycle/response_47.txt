Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 8) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 12) (6, 3) (6, 17) (9, 8) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 18) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 2) (7, 16) (7, 5) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 8) (5, 7) (5, 1) (13, 17) (13, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (17, 6) (17, 13) (17, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 18) (16, 7) (16, 19) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 19) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 19) (19, 16) (19, 14) (19, 18) (19, 2) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 19) (4, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <3, 15, 14, 11>
- <3, 15, 12, 10>
- <3, 18, 19, 2>
- <3, 12, 10, 0>
- <15, 14, 11, 2>
- <15, 12, 10, 18>
- <6, 17, 13, 2>
- <9, 8, 12, 10>
- <10, 11, 14, 19>
- <11, 14, 19, 18>
- <7, 16, 19, 18>
- <12, 10, 18, 19>
- <12, 8, 9, 0>
- <17, 13, 2, 19>
- <8, 9, 0, 1>
- <0, 10, 12, 8>
- <16, 19, 18, 0>
- <14, 19, 18, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each of these cycles:
- <3, 15, 14, 11> (Chord: (15, 14))
- <3, 12, 10, 0> (Chord: (12, 10))
- <15, 12, 10, 18> (Chord: (12, 10))
- <6, 17, 13, 2> (Chord: (17, 13))
- <9, 8, 12, 10> (Chord: (8, 12))
- <10, 11, 14, 19> (Chord: (11, 14))
- <7, 16, 19, 18> (Chord: (16, 19))
- <12, 10, 18, 19> (Chord: (10, 18))
- <17, 13, 2, 19> (Chord: (13, 2))
- <8, 9, 0, 1> (Chord: (9, 0))
- <0, 10, 12, 8> (Chord: (10, 12))
- <16, 19, 18, 0> (Chord: (19, 18))
- <14, 19, 18, 3> (Chord: (19, 18))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have a total of [12]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<3, 15, 14, 11>
<3, 12, 10, 0>
<15, 12, 10, 18>
<6, 17, 13, 2>
<9, 8, 12, 10>
<10, 11, 14, 19>
<7, 16, 19, 18>
<12, 10, 18, 19>
<17, 13, 2, 19>
<8, 9, 0, 1>
<0, 10, 12, 8>
<16, 19, 18, 0>
