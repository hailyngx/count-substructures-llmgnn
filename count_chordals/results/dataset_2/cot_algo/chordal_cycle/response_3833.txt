        - Cycle 4: (26, 12, 14, 13, 26)
        - Cycle 5: (26, 12, 14, 25, 26)
        - Cycle 6: (26, 24, 19, 22, 26)

        - Cycle 12: (17, 27, 28, 4, 17)
        - Cycle 13: (17, 15, 25, 14, 17)
        - Cycle 14: (6, 21, 11, 1, 6)
        - Cycle 15: (6, 16, 15, 25, 6)
        - Cycle 16: (21, 11, 1, 9, 21)
        - Cycle 17: (16, 12, 26, 27, 16)
        - Cycle 18: (22, 4, 28, 7, 22)
        - Cycle 19: (22, 19, 24, 5, 22)
        - Cycle 20: (25, 14, 13, 7, 25)
        - Cycle 21: (4, 22, 0, 2, 4)
        - Cycle 22: (12, 14, 25, 15, 12)
        - Cycle 23: (19, 22, 0, 2, 19)
        - Cycle 24: (19, 24, 5, 18, 19)
        - Cycle 25: (3, 7, 13, 14, 3)
        - Cycle 26: (7, 29, 18, 5, 7)
        - Cycle 27: (15, 25, 14, 23, 15)
        - Cycle 28: (29, 12, 16, 15, 29)
        - Cycle 29: (29, 7, 28, 27, 29)
        - Cycle 30: (29, 10, 3, 7, 29)
        - Cycle 31: (11, 21, 6, 16, 11)
        - Cycle 32: (5, 8, 5)
        - Cycle 33: (5, 18, 29, 10, 5)
        - Cycle 34: (5, 20, 22, 4, 5)
        - Cycle 35: (20, 7, 3, 10, 20)
        - Cycle 36: (10, 5, 24, 26, 10)
        - Cycle 37: (18, 5, 24, 26, 18)
        - Cycle 38: (27, 2, 0, 22, 27)
        - Cycle 39: (27, 28, 4, 22, 27)
        - Cycle 40: (14, 25, 15, 16, 14)
        - Cycle 41: (14, 23, 10, 29, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - We found 3 cycles with exactly one chord:
          <9, (24, 5), 8, (9)>
          <26, (12, 14), 13, (26)>
          <17, (27, 28), 4, (17)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - Since we found 3 cycles with exactly one chord, the number of chordless cycles is [41].
