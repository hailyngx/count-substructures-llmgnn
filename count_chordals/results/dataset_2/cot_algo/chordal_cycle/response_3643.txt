Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 4-5-2-8-4
- Cycle 2: 4-5-3-0-4
- Cycle 3: 4-6-1-8-4
- Cycle 4: 4-6-0-7-4
- Cycle 5: 5-9-4-8-5
- Cycle 6: 5-9-7-0-5
- Cycle 7: 2-8-4-6-2
- Cycle 8: 0-6-4-8-0
- Cycle 9: 0-6-1-7-0
- Cycle 10: 1-6-4-8-1
- Cycle 11: 3-5-2-8-3
- Cycle 12: 3-5-4-6-3
- Cycle 13: 3-0-6-4-3
- Cycle 14: 3-0-1-7-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1: <4, (5, 2), 8>
- Cycle 2: <4, (5, 3), 0>
- Cycle 3: <4, (1, 8), 6>
- Cycle 4: <4, (0, 7), 6>
- Cycle 5: <5, (9, 7), 8>
- Cycle 6: <5, (9, 7), 0>
- Cycle 7: <2, (4, 6), 8>
- Cycle 8: <0, (6, 1), 8>
- Cycle 9: <0, (6, 1), 7>
- Cycle 10: <1, (6, 4), 8>
- Cycle 11: <3, (5, 2), 8>
- Cycle 12: <3, (5, 4), 6>
- Cycle 13: <3, (1, 7), 6>
- Cycle 14: <3, (1, 7), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [14].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<4, (5, 2), 8>
<4, (5, 3), 0>
<4, (1, 8), 6>
<4, (0, 7), 6>
<5, (9, 7), 8>
<5, (9, 7), 0>
<2, (4, 6), 8>
<0, (6, 1), 8>
<0, (6, 1), 7>
<1, (6, 4), 8>
<3, (5, 2), 8>
<3, (5, 4), 6>
<3, (1, 7), 6>
<3, (1, 7), 0>
