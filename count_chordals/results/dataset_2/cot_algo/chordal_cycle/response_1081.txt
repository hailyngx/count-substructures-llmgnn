Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (18, 22) (18, 23) (18, 12) (18, 29) (22, 18) (12, 18) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 1) (27, 13) (27, 23) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 21) (0, 17) (20, 0) (20, 6) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 7) (29, 18) (29, 4) (19, 26) (19, 2) (19, 28) (19, 10) (26, 19) (26, 25) (26, 4) (1, 27) (1, 15) (1, 25) (15, 17) (15, 1) (15, 25) (3, 0) (3, 24) (21, 0) (21, 23) (21, 5) (21, 14) (4, 29) (4, 26) (4, 23) (4, 25) (10, 19) (10, 2) (10, 14) (8, 28) (8, 5) (8, 25) (8, 6) (8, 7) (28, 19) (28, 8) (6, 20) (6, 8) (6, 14) (5, 21) (5, 8) (5, 24) (5, 14) (14, 21) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 16) (23, 18) (23, 27) (23, 21) (23, 4) (23, 2) (24, 3) (24, 5) (24, 9) (25, 26) (25, 1) (25, 15) (25, 4) (25, 8) (2, 19) (2, 10) (2, 23) (16, 14) (16, 13) (13, 27) (13, 16) (9, 24) (7, 17) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: (18, 22, 29, 4, 26, 19, 10, 14, 21, 23, 27, 12, 18)
- Cycle 2: (3, 0, 17, 15, 1, 27, 23, 21, 5, 24, 3)
- Cycle 3: (8, 28, 19, 10, 14, 6, 20, 0, 3, 24, 5, 8)
- Cycle 4: (25, 26, 4, 23, 21, 5, 8, 25)
- Cycle 5: (14, 21, 23, 27, 13, 16, 14)
- Cycle 6: (15, 1, 27, 13, 16, 14, 10, 2, 23, 21, 14, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (29, 26).
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<29, (26), 4, 23, 21, 5, 24, 3>
