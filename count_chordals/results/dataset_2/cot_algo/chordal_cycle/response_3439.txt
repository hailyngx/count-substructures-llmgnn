Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 2) (16, 12) (16, 15) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 9) (15, 16) (15, 3) (5, 6) (5, 17) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 19) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 10) (17, 5) (17, 13) (17, 12) (17, 8) (17, 2) (8, 17) (8, 19) (8, 1) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (12, 16) (12, 17) (12, 4) (12, 18) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 14) (14, 7) (14, 1) (2, 11) (2, 17) (2, 10) (9, 3) (9, 4) (18, 12) (10, 13) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-11-13-7-0
- Cycle 2: 0-11-2-17-5-0
- Cycle 3: 0-11-2-17-13-7-0
- Cycle 4: 0-5-17-12-16-15-3-19-6-0
- Cycle 5: 0-5-17-12-18-4-9-3-15-16-6-0
- Cycle 6: 3-15-16-12-17-2-11-0-6-19-3
- Cycle 7: 3-15-16-12-18-4-9-3
- Cycle 8: 3-15-16-12-17-2-10-13-7-0

Step 2: 
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <0, (11, 13), 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 11, (2, 17), 5>
- Cycle 3: <0, (11, 17), 13, 7>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, (17, 12), 16, 15, 3, 19, 6>
- Cycle 5: <0, 5, (17, 12), 18, 4, 9, 3, 15, 16, 6>
- Cycle 6: <3, 15, (16, 12), 17, 2, 11, 0, 6, 19>
- Cycle 7: <3, 15, (16, 12), 18, 4, 9>
- Cycle 8: <3, 15, (16, 12), 17, 2, 10, 13, 7, 0>

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]
