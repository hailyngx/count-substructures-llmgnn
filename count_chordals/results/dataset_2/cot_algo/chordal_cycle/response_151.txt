Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 4, 7, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 9, 2, 1, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 3, 1, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 7, 6, 1, 3, 5)
        - Cycle 6: (9, 1, 6, 7, 5, 9)
        - Cycle 7: (9, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9)
        - Cycle 8: (9, 2, 1, 6, 5, 9)
        - Cycle 9: (9, 2, 4, 7, 5, 9)
        - Cycle 10: (4, 1, 6, 7, 5, 4)
        - Cycle 11: (7, 4, 1, 6, 5, 7)
        - Cycle 12: (6, 1, 9, 5, 7, 6)
        - Cycle 13: (1, 9, 5, 7, 6, 1)
        - Cycle 14: (1, 9, 2, 4, 7, 1)
        - Cycle 15: (1, 6, 7, 5, 3, 1)
        - Cycle 16: (1, 6, 5, 7, 4, 1)
        - Cycle 17: (3, 1, 9, 5, 7, 3)
        - Cycle 18: (2, 9, 5, 7, 4, 2)
        - Cycle 19: (2, 9, 1, 6, 7, 2)
        - Cycle 20: (4, 2, 9, 1, 6, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (9, 1), 4, 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (9, 2), 1, 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (3, 1), 6, 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (7, 4), 1, 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (7, 6), 1, 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, (1, 6), 7, 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <9, (1, 4), 7, 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <9, (2, 1), 6, 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (2, 4), 7, 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <4, (1, 6), 7, 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <7, (4, 1), 6, 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <6, (1, 9), 5, 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <1, (9, 5), 7, 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 14: <1, (9, 2), 4, 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 15: <1, (6, 7), 5, 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 16: <1, (6, 5), 7, 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 17: <3, (1, 9), 5, 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 18: <2, (9, 5), 7, 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 19: <2, (9, 1), 6, 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 20: <4, (2, 9), 1, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [20].
