Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 7) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 12) (4, 12) (4, 9) (18, 16) (17, 3) (17, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 2) (7, 13) (8, 17) (8, 0) (8, 14) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 16) (10, 9) (10, 15) (10, 6) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 11) (12, 3) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 19) (16, 18) (16, 7) (16, 9) (16, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 6) (11, 15) (11, 5) (11, 6) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 13) (19, 0) (19, 15) (19, 12) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 14) (5, 11) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

From the given edges, the cycles are:
1. Cycle 1: 0 - 7 - 1 - 3 - 0
2. Cycle 2: 0 - 7 - 2 - 12 - 0
3. Cycle 3: 0 - 7 - 13 - 3 - 0
4. Cycle 4: 0 - 8 - 17 - 3 - 0
5. Cycle 5: 2 - 7 - 13 - 14 - 2
6. Cycle 6: 4 - 9 - 16 - 18 - 4
7. Cycle 7: 6 - 10 - 9 - 4 - 6
8. Cycle 8: 6 - 10 - 15 - 11 - 6
9. Cycle 9: 6 - 11 - 5 - 15 - 6
10. Cycle 10: 6 - 11 - 15 - 19 - 6
11. Cycle 11: 6 - 14 - 13 - 0 - 6
12. Cycle 12: 6 - 16 - 9 - 4 - 6
13. Cycle 13: 6 - 16 - 18 - 4 - 6
14. Cycle 14: 6 - 16 - 7 - 0 - 6
15. Cycle 15: 6 - 16 - 18 - 4 - 6
16. Cycle 16: 7 - 0 - 13 - 14 - 7
17. Cycle 17: 7 - 0 - 19 - 15 - 7
18. Cycle 18: 8 - 0 - 13 - 14 - 8
19. Cycle 19: 10 - 9 - 4 - 12 - 10
20. Cycle 20: 11 - 15 - 19 - 12 - 11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

From the listed cycles, the following chordal 4-cycles are found:
1. Cycle 1: <0, (1, 3), 7, (2, 12)>
2. Cycle 2: <0, (2, 12), 7, (13, 14)>
3. Cycle 3: <0, (7, 13), 3, (0, 17)>
4. Cycle 4: <4, (9, 16), 6, (10, 15)>
5. Cycle 5: <6, (10, 9), 4, (12, 16)>
6. Cycle 6: <6, (11, 15), 10, (9, 4)>
7. Cycle 7: <6, (14, 13), 0, (7, 8)>
8. Cycle 8: <6, (16, 9), 4, (12, 18)>
9. Cycle 9: <10, (12, 4), 9, (16, 18)>
10. Cycle 10: <11, (15, 19), 6, (14, 13)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
