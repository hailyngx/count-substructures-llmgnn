Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 23) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 16) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 14) (4, 17) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 13) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 23) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 25) (9, 24) (6, 15) (6, 5) (6, 18) (18, 4) (18, 6) (18, 19) (11, 23) (8, 9) (8, 29) (8, 26) (23, 3) (23, 5) (23, 11) (23, 14) (10, 16) (10, 14) (21, 20) (21, 12) (21, 22) (21, 24) (0, 16) (0, 22) (0, 2) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 0) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 17) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 19) (12, 21) (12, 13) (20, 21) (20, 29) (29, 8) (29, 20) (29, 1) (17, 4) (17, 19) (17, 24) (25, 9) (25, 1) (25, 22) (25, 14) (1, 29) (1, 25) (1, 27) (26, 8) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 24) (22, 21) (22, 0) (22, 25) (22, 27) (27, 1) (27, 22) (24, 9) (24, 21) (24, 17) (24, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 23) (14, 10) (14, 25) 

Response:
Following the steps mentioned above, we need to first find all cycles of length 4 in the graph:

1. Cycle: <3, 15, 16, 0>
2. Cycle: <4, 7, 3, 15>
3. Cycle: <5, 9, 8, 29>
4. Cycle: <6, 15, 3, 7>
5. Cycle: <18, 4, 7, 14>
6. Cycle: <2, 3, 15, 6>
7. Cycle: <23, 3, 7, 14>
8. Cycle: <16, 15, 6, 18>
9. Cycle: <19, 18, 6, 5>
10. Cycle: <21, 20, 29, 8>
11. Cycle: <0, 16, 15, 6>
12. Cycle: <17, 4, 7, 14>
13. Cycle: <25, 9, 8, 29>
14. Cycle: <1, 29, 8, 9>
15. Cycle: <27, 1, 29, 8>
16. Cycle: <24, 9, 8, 29>
17. Cycle: <14, 4, 7, 13>
18. Cycle: <22, 21, 20, 29>
19. Cycle: <10, 16, 15, 6>
20. Cycle: <12, 21, 20, 29>

Next, we need to find the chordal 4-cycles which have exactly one chord. The chordal 4-cycles are as follows:
1. <3, (15, 6), 16, 0>
2. <4, 7, (3, 15), 16>
3. <5, (9, 8), 29, 20>
4. <6, (15, 3), 7, 14>
5. <18, (4, 7), 14, 17>
6. <2, (3, 15), 6, 18>
7. <23, 3, (7, 14), 10>
8. <16, (15, 6), 18, 0>
9. <19, (18, 6), 5, 17>
10. <21, (20, 29), 8, 22>
11. <0, 16, (15, 6), 18>
12. <17, (4, 7), 14, 24>
13. <25, (9, 8), 29, 1>
14. <1, 29, (8, 9), 25>
15. <27, 1, (29, 8), 22>
16. <24, (9, 8), 29, 13>
17. <14, 4, (7, 13), 23>
18. <22, 21, (20, 29), 8>
19. <10, 16, (15, 6), 14>
20. <12, 21, (20, 29), 8>

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [20].
