Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 2) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
- No chordal 4-cycles were found in the graph as there are no cycles of length 4 or more.

Step 3:
Since there are no chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, the final count is [0].
