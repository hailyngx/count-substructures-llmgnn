Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Some cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-3-6-4
- Cycle 2: 4-7-1-5-4
- Cycle 3: 4-8-1-5-4
- Cycle 4: 4-8-3-6-4
- Cycle 5: 4-5-2-0-4
- Cycle 6: 7-1-5-2-7
- Cycle 7: 7-3-6-4-7
- Cycle 8: 7-9-1-5-7
- Cycle 9: 8-1-5-2-8
- Cycle 10: 8-3-6-4-8
- Cycle 11: 5-2-0-9-5
- Cycle 12: 6-3-8-1-6
- Cycle 13: 0-2-5-1-0
- Cycle 14: 9-1-7-4-9

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (3, 6), 4)> (Chord: 3-6)
- Cycle 2: <2, (1, 5), 4)> (Chord: 1-5)
- Cycle 3: <3, (1, 8), 4)> (Chord: 1-8)
- Cycle 4: <4, (3, 6), 8)> (Chord: 3-6)
- Cycle 5: <5, (0, 4), 2)> (Chord: 0-4)
- Cycle 6: <6, (1, 7), 5)> (Chord: 1-7)
- Cycle 7: <7, (4, 6), 3)> (Chord: 4-6)
- Cycle 8: <8, (1, 5), 7)> (Chord: 1-5)
- Cycle 9: <9, (2, 5), 8)> (Chord: 2-5)
- Cycle 10: <10, (3, 6), 8)> (Chord: 3-6)
- Cycle 11: <11, (2, 5), 9)> (Chord: 2-5)
- Cycle 12: <12, (1, 8), 6)> (Chord: 1-8)
- Cycle 13: <13, (0, 2), 5)> (Chord: 0-2)
- Cycle 14: <14, (4, 7), 9)> (Chord: 4-7)

Step 3:
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count of chordless 4-cycles is [14].
