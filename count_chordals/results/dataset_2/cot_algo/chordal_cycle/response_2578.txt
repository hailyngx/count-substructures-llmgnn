Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 6) (16, 28) (16, 5) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 29) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 1) (6, 11) (6, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (21, 10) (21, 13) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 20) (22, 8) (15, 27) (15, 29) (15, 12) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 23) (0, 26) (20, 18) (20, 29) (20, 12) (20, 13) (12, 15) (12, 20) (12, 19) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 24) (8, 5) (8, 22) (8, 2) (8, 4) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 23) (4, 18) (4, 27) (4, 8) (4, 1) (26, 0) (26, 23) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 10) (29, 5) (29, 15) (29, 20) (23, 11) (23, 27) (23, 14) (23, 26) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 28) (17, 9) (17, 28) (17, 25) (17, 3) (25, 17) (25, 1) (24, 2) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 19) (19, 11) (19, 12) (19, 3) (19, 13) (13, 21) (13, 20) (13, 3) (13, 19) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 25) 

Response:
Step 1:   
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 3, 17, 9) with edges (5, 3), (3, 17), (17, 9), (9, 6), and (6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 29, 20, 13) with edges (5, 29), (29, 20), (20, 13), (13, 21), and (21, 5)

Step 2:
Checking for each cycle if it has exactly one chord:  
- Cycle 1 has one chord (9, 3)
- Cycle 2 has one chord (13, 5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:  
- <5, 3, 17, 9> (chord: (9, 3))
- <5, 29, 20, 13> (chord: (13, 5))
