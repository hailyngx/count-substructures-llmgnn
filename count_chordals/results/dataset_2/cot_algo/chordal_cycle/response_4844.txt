- Cycle 3: (11, 16, 8, 20, 1, 29, 27, 25, 2, 3, 12)
- Cycle 4: (11, 16, 9, 22, 11)
- Cycle 5: (11, 16, 9, 4, 7, 24, 17, 0, 20, 8)
- Cycle 6: (11, 19, 7, 24, 8, 16, 9, 22, 9)
- Cycle 7: (11, 19, 7, 4, 9)

- Cycle 9: (11, 19, 29, 28, 23, 4, 13, 14, 6, 21)
- Cycle 10: (11, 19, 23, 3, 12, 6, 21, 26, 15, 5, 8)
- Cycle 11: (16, 8, 20, 0, 14, 13, 4, 9, 22, 11)
- Cycle 12: (16, 8, 24, 7, 4, 9, 22, 11, 19, 29)
- Cycle 13: (16, 9, 22, 11, 19, 7, 24, 17, 0, 14)
- Cycle 14: (16, 9, 22, 11, 19, 29, 28, 0, 20, 8)
- Cycle 15: (16, 9, 4, 13, 14, 0, 20, 8, 5, 15)
- Cycle 16: (19, 11, 16, 8, 24, 7, 4, 9, 22, 11)
- Cycle 17: (19, 11, 22, 9, 4, 13, 14, 0, 20, 8)
- Cycle 18: (19, 7, 24, 17, 0, 14, 13, 4, 9, 16)
- Cycle 19: (19, 29, 28, 0, 20, 1, 29, 27, 25, 2)
- Cycle 20: (19, 29, 28, 0, 20, 8, 5, 15, 26, 18)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (12, 26), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (16, 20), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (8, 24), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (7, 17), 29>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 20 cycles listed, and a total of 4 chordal 4-cycles found.

Putting the final count inside brackets, the answer is [16].
