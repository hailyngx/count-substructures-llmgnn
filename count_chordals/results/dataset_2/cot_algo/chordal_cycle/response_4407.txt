Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-2-0-4
- Cycle 2: 4-6-5-1-4
- Cycle 3: 4-3-1-8-4
- Cycle 4: 4-9-2-7-4
- Cycle 5: 7-6-5-1-7
- Cycle 6: 7-2-0-6-7
- Cycle 7: 1-3-4-9-1
- Cycle 8: 1-5-6-0-1
- Cycle 9: 8-1-3-5-8
- Cycle 10: 8-9-2-0-8
- Cycle 11: 5-6-0-2-5

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the chordal 4-cycle:
- <4, (7, 2), 0>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [10]
