Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
1. Cycle: 0 - 6 - 9 - 2 - 0
2. Cycle: 1 - 6 - 9 - 2 - 1
3. Cycle: 2 - 9 - 6 - 7 - 2
4. Cycle: 3 - 1 - 2 - 0 - 3
5. Cycle: 4 - 9 - 6 - 1 - 4
6. Cycle: 5 - 1 - 4 - 5
7. Cycle: 6 - 9 - 4 - 5 - 6
8. Cycle: 7 - 6 - 1 - 8 - 7
9. Cycle: 8 - 1 - 2 - 9 - 8
10. Cycle: 9 - 6 - 7 - 5 - 9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, (6, 9), 2>
2. <1, (6, 9), 4>
3. <2, (6, 7), 9>
4. <3, (1, 2), 0>
5. <4, (6, 1), 9>
6. <5, (1, 4), 5>
7. <6, (9, 4), 1>
8. <7, (6, 1), 8>
9. <8, (1, 2), 9>
10. <9, (6, 7), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
