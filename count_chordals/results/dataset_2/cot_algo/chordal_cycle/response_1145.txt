Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 3) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 12) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 1) (13, 0) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 14) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 12) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (14, 12) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (0, 11) (0, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 10, 11, 14, 8, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 13, 1, 7, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 2, 4, 8, 11, 10, 9)
- Cycle 5: (6, 7, 11, 10, 5, 6)
- Cycle 6: (10, 1, 7, 3, 8, 11, 10)
- Cycle 7: (11, 14, 8, 3, 7, 11)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 3, 7, 6, 4)
- Cycle 9: (13, 1, 7, 3, 14, 12, 13)
- Cycle 10: (12, 3, 7, 6, 13, 12)
- Cycle 11: (2, 4, 8, 3, 12, 14, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the cycles above, the following are chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (13, 7), 6, 5)>
2. <8, (4, 8), 11, 10)>
3. <14, (11, 7), 3, 8)>
4. <13, (1, 7), 3, 12)>
5. <12, (3, 7), 6, 13)>
6. <2, (4, 8), 3, 12)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
