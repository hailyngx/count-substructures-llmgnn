Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 25) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 15) (6, 28) (6, 1) (6, 27) (9, 15) (9, 7) (2, 29) (2, 17) (29, 2) (29, 25) (29, 22) (29, 21) (29, 10) (22, 29) (22, 23) (22, 5) (22, 10) (23, 22) (23, 18) (23, 27) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 24) (4, 14) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 20) (20, 7) (20, 25) (20, 12) (25, 11) (25, 29) (25, 20) (0, 3) (0, 17) (1, 6) (1, 26) (1, 10) (1, 12) (26, 1) (28, 6) (18, 23) (18, 12) (18, 21) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 13) (21, 29) (21, 18) (21, 5) (13, 3) (17, 2) (17, 0) (17, 3) (17, 27) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 24) (24, 4) (24, 8) (24, 27) (19, 4) (15, 16) (15, 9) (27, 6) (27, 23) (27, 17) (27, 24) (12, 20) (12, 1) (12, 18) (12, 14) (14, 4) (14, 12) (5, 22) (5, 21) (5, 10) (10, 16) (10, 29) (10, 22) (10, 1) (10, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 15, 9, 7, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 25, 29, 22, 23, 27, 6, 1, 11)
- Cycle 3: (7, 4, 19, 24, 8, 16, 15, 9, 7)
- Cycle 4: (7, 20, 25, 29, 22, 10, 1, 6, 7)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <1, (6, 7), 11> has a chord (6, 7) in Cycle 1
- <1, (22, 29), 11> has a chord (22, 29) in Cycle 2
- <1, (16, 9), 7> has a chord (16, 9) in Cycle 3
- <1, (25, 22), 7> has a chord (25, 22) in Cycle 4

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless cycles identified.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
