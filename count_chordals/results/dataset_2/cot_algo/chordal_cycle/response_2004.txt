Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 4 - 0 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 9 - 7 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 3: 6 - 5 - 4 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 4: 6 - 2 - 8 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 5: 9 - 4 - 8 - 2 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 7 - 0 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 7: 4 - 8 - 7 - 0 - 4
- Cycle 8: 5 - 6 - 3 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 9: 2 - 6 - 3 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 10: 0 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 11: 7 - 9 - 1 - 5 - 7

Step 2: 
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <2, (4, 9), 7>
- Cycle 2: <4, (7, 9), 1>
- Cycle 3: <6, (8, 2), 5>
- Cycle 4: <9, (0, 4), 7>
- Cycle 5: <9, (2, 8), 7>
- Cycle 6: <4, (0, 8), 7>
- Cycle 7: <5, (3, 4), 6>
- Cycle 8: <2, (6, 4), 3>
- Cycle 9: <0, (2, 4), 7>
- Cycle 10: <7, (1, 9), 5>

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
