Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 11) (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 2) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 3) (3, 5) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 14) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 10) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 0, 4)
- Cycle 2: (7, 0, 12, 7)
- Cycle 3: (8, 13, 12, 8)
- Cycle 4: (13, 12, 5, 13)
- Cycle 5: (12, 5, 3, 12)
- Cycle 6: (2, 0, 3, 2)
- Cycle 7: (5, 11, 3, 5)
- Cycle 8: (11, 0, 2, 11)
- Cycle 9: (0, 1, 4, 0)
- Cycle 10: (9, 10, 14, 9)
- Cycle 11: (1, 6, 14, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (4, 7), 6>
- <2, (7, 12), 0>
- <3, (8, 13), 5>
- <4, (13, 5), 2>
- <5, (12, 0), 3>
- <6, (2, 0), 3>
- <7, (5, 11), 3>
- <8, (11, 0), 2>
- <9, (0, 1), 4>
- <10, (9, 10), 14>
- <11, (1, 6), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [11].
