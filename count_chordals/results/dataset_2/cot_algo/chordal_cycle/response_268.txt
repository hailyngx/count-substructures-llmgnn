Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
    - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 6, 5)
    - Cycle 2: (5, 0, 1, 6, 5)
    - Cycle 3: (5, 3, 1, 6, 5)
    - Cycle 4: (5, 3, 2, 9, 5)
    - Cycle 5: (9, 2, 1, 6, 9)
    - Cycle 6: (4, 7, 9, 2, 4)
    - Cycle 7: (4, 1, 0, 7, 4)
    - Cycle 8: (7, 9, 2, 1, 7)
    - Cycle 9: (7, 0, 5, 3, 7)
    - Cycle 10: (1, 0, 5, 3, 1)
    - Cycle 11: (1, 6, 5, 9, 1)
    - Cycle 12: (3, 5, 9, 2, 3)
    - Cycle 13: (3, 1, 0, 7, 3)
    - Cycle 14: (6, 5, 9, 2, 6)
    - Cycle 15: (2, 9, 7, 0, 2)
    - Cycle 16: (8, 9, 2, 1, 8)
    - Cycle 17: (8, 7, 0, 1, 8)
    - Cycle 18: (0, 5, 9, 2, 0)

Step 2:
    - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <7, (0, 8), 1, 4>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, (1, 7), 0, 5>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, (1, 9), 2, 5>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, (5, 9), 2, 6>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, (1, 7), 5, 3>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <8, (1, 9), 2, 7>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <0, (2, 8), 1, 5>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (2, 9), 1, 7>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <0, (3, 7), 1, 5>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <8, (3, 9), 1, 7>

Step 3:
    Number of chordless 4-cycles: [18]
