Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 14) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 12) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <1, 5, 9, 1>
- Cycle <1, 5, 3, 11, 1>
- Cycle <1, 2, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle <1, 2, 3, 11, 1>
- Cycle <1, 12, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle <1, 12, 2, 10, 1>
- Cycle <1, 12, 14, 8, 1>
- Cycle <2, 3, 11, 1, 2>
- Cycle <2, 4, 12, 2>
- Cycle <2, 10, 12, 2>
- Cycle <3, 5, 9, 3>
- Cycle <3, 6, 7, 11, 3>
- Cycle <3, 10, 12, 3>
- Cycle <4, 9, 12, 4>
- Cycle <6, 7, 8, 14, 6>
- Cycle <8, 7, 0, 2, 8>
- Cycle <11, 7, 0, 2, 11>
- Cycle <12, 4, 9, 12>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycle in the above cycles is <1, 5, 9, 1>. 
So, the chordless cycles found are: <1, 2, 4, 9>, <2, 3, 11, 1>, <1, 12, 4, 9>, <1, 12, 2, 10, 1>, <1, 12, 14, 8, 1>, <2, 3, 11, 1, 2>, <2, 4, 12, 2>, <2, 10, 12, 2>, <3, 5, 9, 3>, <3, 6, 7, 11, 3>, <3, 10, 12, 3>, <4, 9, 12, 4>, <6, 7, 8, 14, 6>, <8, 7, 0, 2, 8>, <11, 7, 0, 2, 11>.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [15].
