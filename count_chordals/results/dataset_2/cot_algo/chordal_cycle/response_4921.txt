Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-5
- Cycle 2: 4-7-6-5-4
- Cycle 3: 4-7-6-9-4
- Cycle 4: 4-7-2-6-4
- Cycle 5: 4-2-6-7-4
- Cycle 6: 4-3-7-6-4
- Cycle 7: 3-4-7-2-3
- Cycle 8: 3-7-6-5-3
- Cycle 9: 3-7-6-9-3
- Cycle 10: 3-7-2-6-3
- Cycle 11: 3-8-4-7-3
- Cycle 12: 3-8-1-2-3
- Cycle 13: 3-8-1-9-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <5, 9, 6, 3>, with chord (5, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 12 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
