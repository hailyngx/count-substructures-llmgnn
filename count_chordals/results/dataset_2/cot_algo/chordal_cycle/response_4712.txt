Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 4) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 25) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 12) (26, 10) (26, 11) (6, 9) (6, 28) (6, 24) (7, 21) (7, 19) (7, 5) (21, 7) (21, 10) (0, 13) (0, 22) (0, 27) (0, 11) (27, 0) (27, 14) (3, 25) (3, 8) (25, 22) (25, 3) (25, 12) (8, 3) (8, 23) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 18) (23, 8) (23, 4) (23, 17) (4, 22) (4, 8) (4, 23) (28, 6) (28, 18) (28, 20) (1, 9) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 10) (15, 10) (15, 2) (10, 26) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 15) (20, 28) (20, 29) (20, 12) (29, 20) (18, 8) (18, 28) (18, 19) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 24) (24, 6) (24, 19) (11, 22) (11, 26) (11, 0) (11, 8) (2, 15) (2, 5) (2, 14) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 17) (16, 1) (16, 17) (16, 14) (17, 23) (17, 5) (17, 16) (12, 9) (12, 25) (12, 20) (14, 27) (14, 2) (14, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
  - Cycle 1: (0, 13, 22, 4, 8, 11, 0)
  - Cycle 2: (1, 9, 6, 28, 18, 8, 4, 22, 0, 27, 14, 2, 16, 1)
  - Cycle 3: (2, 15, 10, 21, 7, 5, 2)
  - Cycle 4: (5, 7, 21, 10, 26, 11, 22, 4, 23, 17, 5)
  - Cycle 5: (8, 23, 17, 16, 1, 5, 8)
  - Cycle 6: (9, 6, 24, 19, 7, 5, 1, 16, 17, 23, 8, 3, 25, 12, 9)
  - Cycle 7: (10, 26, 11, 8, 4, 23, 17, 16, 14, 27, 0, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
  - <1, (4, 8), 2> (Cycle 1 with chord 8)
  - <2, (16, 4), 14> (Cycle 2 with chord 16)
  - <3, (10, 22), 26> (Cycle 4 with chord 10)
  - <4, (23, 8), 17> (Cycle 5 with chord 23)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:
  - There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the count is [3].
