Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 21) (16, 1) (16, 4) (9, 29) (9, 3) (9, 1) (26, 24) (26, 8) (2, 7) (29, 9) (29, 18) (3, 9) (3, 25) (3, 28) (25, 3) (25, 19) (25, 14) (25, 10) (8, 26) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 14) (22, 23) (22, 15) (22, 12) (23, 22) (23, 15) (23, 14) (23, 27) (12, 22) (12, 27) (12, 1) (27, 23) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 5) (5, 27) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 1) (6, 20) (24, 11) (24, 26) (24, 7) (21, 16) (21, 6) (21, 20) (21, 18) (10, 25) (10, 7) (15, 22) (15, 23) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 19) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 12) (1, 6) (19, 25) (19, 28) (19, 7) (18, 29) (18, 27) (18, 21) (18, 0) (14, 25) (14, 13) (14, 23) (20, 6) (20, 21) (0, 5) (0, 18) (17, 11) (17, 28) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 24) (7, 10) (7, 19) (4, 16) (4, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: (11, 16, 1, 8, 26, 24, 11)
2. Cycle 2: (9, 29, 18, 27, 12, 22, 15, 23, 14, 13, 25, 3, 9)
3. Cycle 3: (2, 7, 24, 26, 8, 1, 16, 21, 6, 5, 27, 12, 22, 2)
4. Cycle 4: (3, 9, 1, 8, 26, 24, 21, 6, 5, 27, 12, 1, 3)
5. Cycle 5: (25, 3, 9, 29, 18, 27, 5, 6, 21, 20, 7, 19, 25)
6. Cycle 6: (14, 13, 25, 19, 28, 3, 25, 10, 7, 24, 26, 8, 14)
7. Cycle 7: (22, 23, 15, 22)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <1, 16, 8, 26>
- <9, 18, 27, 12>
- <1, 8, 26, 24>
- <3, 9, 1, 8>
- <25, 3, 9, 29>
- <14, 25, 19, 28>
- <22, 15, 23, 22>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
