Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 1) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 7) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 6) (6, 12) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) 

Response:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <5, (2, 10), 13>
2. <5, (2, 12), 13>
3. <5, (1, 3), 14>
4. <4, (9, 11), 8>
5. <4, (9, 10), 8>
6. <4, (8, 3), 14>
