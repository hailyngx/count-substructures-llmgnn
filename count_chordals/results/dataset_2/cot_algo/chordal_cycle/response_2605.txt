Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (3, 5, 3, 9)
- (3, 1, 7, 4)
- (3, 1, 6, 4)
- (3, 1, 7, 6)
- (3, 8, 9, 7)
- (3, 8, 4, 7)
- (3, 8, 6, 4)
- (1, 7, 6, 4)
- (1, 7, 4, 8)
- (1, 6, 4, 8)
- (4, 7, 6, 8)
- (7, 1, 3, 5)
- (7, 1, 3, 2)
- (7, 1, 6, 4)
- (7, 1, 6, 6)
- (7, 1, 6, 8)
- (7, 6, 4, 8)
- (7, 6, 8, 4)
- (1, 6, 8, 4)
- (8, 9, 7, 4)
- (8, 9, 7, 6)
- (8, 9, 7, 2)
- (8, 9, 7, 1)
- (8, 4, 7, 6)
- (8, 4, 7, 2)
- (8, 4, 7, 1)
- (8, 6, 4, 7)
- (4, 7, 6, 2)
- (6, 4, 7, 2)
- (7, 1, 3, 2)
- (7, 1, 8, 4)
- (7, 4, 8, 6)
- (7, 4, 6, 8)
- (7, 4, 6, 6)
- (7, 6, 4, 8)
- (7, 6, 8, 4)
- (1, 6, 4, 7)
- (1, 6, 8, 4)
- (7, 6, 8, 4)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (7, 4), 3>
- <1, (6, 4), 7>
- <4, (7, 6), 8>
- <6, (7, 8), 4>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
