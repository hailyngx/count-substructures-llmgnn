Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 0) (14, 15) (17, 1) (17, 0) (17, 8) (17, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (9, 18) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 13) (5, 6) (5, 4) (0, 14) (0, 17) (0, 10) (1, 17) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (15, 14) (15, 9) (15, 16) (15, 18) (16, 15) (16, 18) (16, 4) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 1) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 7) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 16) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 1) (7, 19) (7, 3) (2, 10) (2, 19) (2, 4) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (4, 17) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (0, 14, 15, 16, 4, 5, 6, 10, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 14, 15, 9, 18, 16, 4, 5, 6, 10, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 14, 15, 18, 16, 4, 5, 6, 10, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

From the above cycles, we can see that Cycle 2 has exactly one chord, which is between nodes 9 and 10.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are <0>, chordal 4-cycle in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
