Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 13) (14, 6) (14, 11) (14, 13) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 12) (9, 13) (13, 6) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
        There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-7-1-3-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-7-9-3-0
        - Cycle 3: 0-5-2-4-10-3-0
        - Cycle 4: 0-5-2-8-6-14-11-0
        - Cycle 5: 0-5-8-2-4-10-3-0
        - Cycle 6: 0-13-6-14-11-13-0
        - Cycle 7: 0-13-9-2-4-10-13-0
        - Cycle 8: 0-13-9-12-6-14-11-13-0

Step 2:
        Only Cycle 3: 0-5-2-4-10-3-0 has exactly one chord 2-10.

Step 3:
        There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final count is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 5, 2, 4, 10, 3>.
