Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle <0, 5, 3, 4>
2. Cycle <0, 5, 1, 7>
3. Cycle <0, 5, 8, 6>
4. Cycle <1, 5, 3, 7>
5. Cycle <1, 5, 9, 2>
6. Cycle <2, 9, 4, 3>
7. Cycle <3, 5, 9, 4>
8. Cycle <3, 5, 1, 7>
9. Cycle <4, 9, 7, 3>
10. Cycle <6, 5, 1, 7>
11. Cycle <6, 5, 8, 0>
12. Cycle <7, 9, 2, 1>
13. Cycle <8, 5, 1, 3>
14. Cycle <8, 5, 9, 6>
15. Cycle <9, 5, 1, 7>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <1, 5, 3, 7> has chord (1, 3)
- Cycle <1, 5, 9, 2> has chord (1, 9)
- Cycle <3, 5, 1, 7> has chord (3, 1)
- Cycle <9, 5, 1, 7> has chord (9, 1)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 11 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 5, 3, 4>
<0, 5, 1, 7>
<0, 5, 8, 6>
<2, 9, 4, 3>
