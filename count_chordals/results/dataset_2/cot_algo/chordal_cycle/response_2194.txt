Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (6, 5, 8, 6)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 8, 1)
- Cycle 3: (3, 4, 1, 3)
- Cycle 4: (0, 7, 8, 0)
- Cycle 5: (2, 9, 8, 2)
- Cycle 6: (6, 8, 7, 0, 6)
- Cycle 7: (4, 1, 6, 0, 4)
- Cycle 8: (8, 5, 2, 6, 8)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 5, 2, 4)
- Cycle 10: (3, 4, 8, 9, 3)
- Cycle 11: (1, 8, 9, 2, 1)
- Cycle 12: (0, 7, 8, 9, 0)
- Cycle 13: (6, 5, 2, 3, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <6, (5, 8), 6> - Chord (5, 8) 
- <1, (4, 8), 1> - Chord (4, 8)
- <3, (4, 1), 3> - Chord (4, 1)
- <0, (7, 8), 0> - Chord (7, 8)
- <2, (9, 8), 2> - Chord (9, 8)
- No chord for cycles 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final answer is [5].
