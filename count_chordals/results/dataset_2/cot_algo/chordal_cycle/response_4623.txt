Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 1) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 5) (10, 16) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 15) (8, 6) (8, 5) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 15) (0, 3) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (1, 9) (1, 15) (1, 2) (15, 9) (15, 4) (15, 18) (15, 1) (19, 18) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 7) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 3) (16, 10) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 3) (11, 13) (11, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (2, 14, 17, 10, 2)
- Cycle 2: (2, 14, 17, 6, 2)
- Cycle 3: (2, 14, 17, 10, 12, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 14, 17, 6, 8, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 14, 17, 10, 13, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 14, 17, 10, 16, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 14, 17, 6, 8, 5, 13, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 14, 17, 6, 8, 5, 10, 12, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 14, 17, 10, 13, 11, 19, 7, 3, 12, 2)
- Cycle 10: (2, 14, 17, 10, 13, 11, 19, 7, 3, 0, 12, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<1, (10, 12), 3, 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
