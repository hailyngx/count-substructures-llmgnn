Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- 4-cycle: 0-1-4-2-0
- 4-cycle: 0-1-7-4-0
- 4-cycle: 0-2-4-1-0
- 4-cycle: 0-2-7-1-0
- 4-cycle: 0-4-7-1-0
- 4-cycle: 3-1-7-4-3
- 4-cycle: 3-1-0-4-3
- 4-cycle: 3-5-9-6-3
- 4-cycle: 5-3-7-2-5
- 4-cycle: 8-0-4-7-8
- 4-cycle: 8-5-9-6-8
- 4-cycle: 9-5-8-0-9

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord:
- For the 4-cycle 0-1-4-2-0, the chord (1, 4) exists.
- For the 4-cycle 0-1-7-4-0, the chord (1, 7) exists.
- For the 4-cycle 0-2-4-1-0, the chord (2, 1) exists.
- For the 4-cycle 0-2-7-1-0, the chord (2, 7) exists.
- For the 4-cycle 0-4-7-1-0, the chord (4, 7) exists.
- For the 4-cycle 3-1-7-4-3, the chord (1, 4) exists.
- For the 4-cycle 3-5-9-6-3, the chord (5, 9) exists.
- For the 4-cycle 5-3-7-2-5, the chord (3, 7) exists.
- For the 4-cycle 8-0-4-7-8, the chord (0, 4) exists.
- For the 4-cycle 9-5-8-0-9, the chord (5, 8) exists.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, (1, 4), 2, 0>
<0, (1, 7), 4, 0>
<0, (2, 1), 4, 0>
<0, (2, 7), 1, 0>
<0, (4, 7), 1, 0>
<3, (1, 4), 7, 3>
<3, (5, 9), 6, 3>
<5, (3, 7), 2, 5>
<8, (0, 4), 7, 8>
<9, (5, 8), 0, 9>
