Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph of length 4 or more. Let's list them:
- Cycle 1: 5-6-9-4-5
- Cycle 2: 5-7-1-0-5
- Cycle 3: 5-2-6-3-5
- Cycle 4: 9-6-2-1-9
- Cycle 5: 9-4-0-8-9
- Cycle 6: 6-5-8-0-6
- Cycle 7: 6-9-3-1-6
- Cycle 8: 6-2-5-7-6
- Cycle 9: 1-3-9-4-1
- Cycle 10: 1-7-5-8-1
- Cycle 11: 3-1-2-6-3
- Cycle 12: 3-9-4-0-3
- Cycle 13: 4-9-6-5-4
- Cycle 14: 4-0-1-7-4
- Cycle 15: 8-5-7-1-8
- Cycle 16: 8-0-4-9-8
- Cycle 17: 2-5-6-9-2
- Cycle 18: 2-1-3-6-2
- Cycle 19: 2-8-0-4-2
- Cycle 20: 0-1-3-9-0
- Cycle 21: 0-4-9-6-0
- Cycle 22: 0-8-5-7-0
- Cycle 23: 7-5-2-1-7
- Cycle 24: 7-1-3-9-7

Step 2:
Let's check each of these cycles for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 10: 1-7-5-8-1 has exactly one chord (edges 5-8).

Step 3:
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (5, 8), 7>.
