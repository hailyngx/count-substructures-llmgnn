- Cycle 34: <4, 6, 17, 19, 3>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 is chordal with chord <0, 2>
- Cycle 2 is chordal with chord <2, 15>
- Cycle 3 is chordal with chord <0, 12>
- Cycle 4 is chordal with chord <0, 17>
- Cycle 5 is chordal with chord <2, 11>
- Cycle 6 is chordal with chord <5, 4>
- Cycle 7 is chordal with chord <8, 16>
- Cycle 8 is chordal with chord <6, 4>
- Cycle 9 is chordal with chord <16, 15>
- Cycle 10 is chordal with chord <16, 17>
- Cycle 11 is chordal with chord <2, 13>
- Cycle 12 is chordal with chord <5, 14>
- Cycle 13 is chordal with chord <5, 8>
- Cycle 14 is chordal with chord <1, 4>
- Cycle 15 is chordal with chord <1, 10>
- Cycle 16 is chordal with chord <8, 2>
- Cycle 17 is chordal with chord <8, 15>
- Cycle 18 is chordal with chord <8, 18>
- Cycle 19 is chordal with chord <8, 6>

- Cycle 25 is chordal with chord <7, 5>
- Cycle 26 is chordal with chord <8, 4>
- Cycle 27 is chordal with chord <8, 0>
- Cycle 28 is chordal with chord <8, 17>
- Cycle 29 is chordal with chord <3, 17>
- Cycle 30 is chordal with chord <3, 6>
- Cycle 31 is chordal with chord <16, 3>
- Cycle 32 is chordal with chord <4, 9>
- Cycle 33 is chordal with chord <6, 12>
- Cycle 34 is chordal with chord <6, 19>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 34 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final result is [34].
