Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 12) (10, 9) (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 14) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 14) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 13) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle: (5, 8, 9, 10)
- Cycle: (5, 8, 2, 6)
- Cycle: (5, 7, 2, 6)
- Cycle: (9, 8, 2, 6)
- Cycle: (9, 10, 14, 12)
- Cycle: (1, 3, 12, 13)
- Cycle: (1, 11, 7, 2)
- Cycle: (1, 11, 0, 14)
- Cycle: (3, 1, 11, 5)
- Cycle: (3, 12, 14, 0)
- Cycle: (10, 9, 8, 7)
- Cycle: (11, 5, 4, 7)
- Cycle: (11, 9, 10, 14)
- Cycle: (1, 0, 14, 2)
- Cycle: (14, 10, 0, 3)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <5, 8, 9, 10> (Chord: (8, 9))
- <5, 8, 2, 6> (Chord: (8, 2))
- <9, 8, 2, 6> (Chord: (9, 2))
- <1, 3, 12, 13> (Chord: (3, 12))
- <1, 11, 0, 14> (Chord: (11, 0))
- <3, 12, 14, 0> (Chord: (12, 14))

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles found = [9]
