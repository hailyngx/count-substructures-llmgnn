Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-7-6-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-3-8-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-4-2-5
- Cycle 4: 5-9-7-8-5
- Cycle 5: 5-6-1-2-5
- Cycle 6: 5-6-7-9-5
- Cycle 7: 5-6-2-1-5
- Cycle 8: 5-2-4-9-5
- Cycle 9: 5-2-6-1-5
- Cycle 10: 5-2-1-6-5

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (6, 9), 5>
- <2, (4, 9), 5>
- <3, (3, 8), 5>
- <4, (7, 8), 5>
- <5, (1, 2), 5>
- <6, (6, 9), 5>
- <7, (2, 6), 5>
- <8, (1, 4), 5>
- <9, (1, 6), 5>
- <10, (2, 6), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
