Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-8-2-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-6-5
- Cycle 3: 5-2-8-3-5
- Cycle 4: 5-1-0-3-5
- Cycle 5: 5-0-1-7-4-5
- Cycle 6: 9-8-3-0-9
- Cycle 7: 9-6-5-4-9
- Cycle 8: 6-5-4-7-6
- Cycle 9: 4-7-2-8-4
- Cycle 10: 7-1-0-3-7
- Cycle 11: 2-8-9-6-2
- Cycle 12: 8-3-0-1-8
- Cycle 13: 3-4-7-1-3
- Cycle 14: 0-3-4-5-0
- Cycle 15 (4-cycle): 5-1-7-2-5
- Cycle 16 (4-cycle): 5-2-1-0-5
- Cycle 17 (4-cycle): 5-4-7-2-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 15 (5-1-7-2-5) has one chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 16 (5-2-1-0-5) has one chord (2, 0)
- Cycle 17 (5-4-7-2-5) has one chord (4, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, 1, 7, 2>
- <5, 2, 1, 0>
- <5, 4, 7, 2>
