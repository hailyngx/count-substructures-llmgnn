Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 13) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 13) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 0, 13, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 14, 11, 10, 5)
- Cycle 4: (3, 2, 10, 8, 3)
- Cycle 5: (12, 3, 8, 6, 12)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (4, 7), and <5, (4, 7), 9> is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (0, 13), and <5, (0, 13), 9> is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 has a chord (14, 11), and <5, (14, 11), 9> is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 4 has a chord (2, 10), and <3, (2, 10), 8> is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 5 has a chord (3, 8), and <12, (3, 8), 6> is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [5].
