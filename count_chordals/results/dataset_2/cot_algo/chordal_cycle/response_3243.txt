Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1-5-9-2-1
2. Cycle 2-6-7-8-9
3. Cycle 2-6-3-0-4
4. Cycle 2-4-0-3-6
5. Cycle 2-4-9-1-8
6. Cycle 0-2-8-7-6
7. Cycle 0-2-9-5-4
8. Cycle 0-3-6-7-8
9. Cycle 0-4-1-9-5
10. Cycle 1-4-0-2-8
11. Cycle 1-4-5-9-2

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1-5-9-2-1 has a chord (9-2) and is not a 4-cycle.
- Cycle 2-6-7-8-9 has a chord (6-8) and is not a 4-cycle.
- Cycle 2-6-3-0-4 has a chord (6-0) and is not a 4-cycle.
- Cycle 2-4-0-3-6 is a chordal 4-cycle: <2, 4, 3, 6>.
- Cycle 2-4-9-1-8 has a chord (4-1) and is not a 4-cycle.
- Cycle 0-2-8-7-6 has a chord (2-7) and is not a 4-cycle.
- Cycle 0-2-9-5-4 is a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, 5, 4>.
- Cycle 0-3-6-7-8 has a chord (3-7) and is not a 4-cycle.
- Cycle 0-4-1-9-5 has a chord (4-1) and is not a 4-cycle.
- Cycle 1-4-0-2-8 has a chord (4-2) and is not a 4-cycle.
- Cycle 1-4-5-9-2 is a chordal 4-cycle: <1, 4, 9, 5>.

Step 3:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found: <2, 4, 3, 6>, <0, 9, 5, 4>, <1, 4, 9, 5>.
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [8].
