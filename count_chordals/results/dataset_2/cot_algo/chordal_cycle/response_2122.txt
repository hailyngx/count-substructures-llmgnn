Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 20) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 3) (1, 23) (3, 22) (3, 12) (8, 15) (8, 25) (8, 7) (23, 1) (23, 4) (23, 9) (6, 28) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 11) (28, 10) (0, 17) (0, 18) (14, 4) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 21) (11, 28) (11, 9) (11, 12) (17, 0) (17, 20) (17, 26) (20, 13) (20, 17) (20, 26) (20, 19) (7, 8) (7, 18) (25, 13) (25, 8) (25, 26) (19, 6) (19, 20) (19, 18) (19, 4) (18, 0) (18, 7) (18, 19) (18, 12) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 26) (26, 17) (26, 20) (26, 25) (26, 10) (26, 27) (9, 23) (9, 11) (9, 27) (2, 5) (2, 16) (2, 24) (5, 14) (5, 2) (5, 21) (16, 2) (24, 2) (27, 26) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 21) (29, 27) (29, 15) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 29) (4, 23) (4, 14) (4, 19) (4, 21) (21, 14) (21, 5) (21, 27) (21, 4) (21, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <3, 22, 10, 28>
- Cycle 2: <14, 4, 23, 9>
- Cycle 3: <15, 8, 25, 26>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1: <3, 22, 10, 28> has a chord (3, 10).
- Cycle 2: <14, 4, 23, 9> has a chord (4, 23).
- Cycle 3: <15, 8, 25, 26> has a chord (8, 25).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
