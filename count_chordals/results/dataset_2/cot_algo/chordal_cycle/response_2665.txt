Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 12) (15, 2) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 9) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 17) (17, 10) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 2) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 18) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 13) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 8) (18, 8) (18, 7) (12, 15) (12, 6) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 16) (5, 1) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 12) (19, 11) (7, 18) (1, 0) (1, 5) (1, 13) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 13) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 1) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle with 4 nodes: (3, 15, 2, 8, 3)
2. Cycle with 4 nodes: (11, 10, 17, 6, 11)
3. Cycle with 4 nodes: (14, 3, 6, 12, 14)
4. Cycle with 4 nodes: (0, 1, 5, 8, 0)
5. Cycle with 4 nodes: (13, 1, 5, 16, 13)
6. Cycle with 4 nodes: (9, 11, 17, 2, 9)
7. Cycle with 4 nodes: (18, 8, 2, 17, 18)
8. Cycle with 4 nodes: (5, 16, 10, 9, 5)
9. Cycle with 4 nodes: (6, 12, 15, 2, 6)
10. Cycle with 4 nodes: (13, 0, 14, 3, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. <1, (2, 8), 3>
2. <10, (11, 17), 6>
3. <3, (6, 12), 14>
4. <0, (1, 5), 8>
5. <1, (5, 16), 13>
6. <9, (10, 17), 11>
7. <8, (2, 17), 18>
8. <5, (10, 9), 16>
9. <2, (6, 15), 17>
10. <0, (3, 14), 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
