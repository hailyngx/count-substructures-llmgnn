Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- The cycle (0, 2, 5, 3) with edges (0, 2), (2, 5), (5, 3), (3, 0).
- The cycle (1, 4, 2, 0) with edges (1, 4), (4, 2), (2, 0), (0, 1).

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The cycle (0, 2, 5, 3) has a chord (0, 5).
- The cycle (1, 4, 2, 0) has a chord (1, 2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Thus, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <0, 2, 5, 3, (0, 5)>
- <1, 4, 2, 0, (1, 2)>
