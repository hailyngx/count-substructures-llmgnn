Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 5) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (0, 13) (0, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 3) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 12) (3, 9) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 10-11-5-4-10
- Cycle 2: 10-7-11-5-10
- Cycle 3: 10-12-8-7-10
- Cycle 4: 13-8-7-11-13
- Cycle 5: 13-8-12-10-13
- Cycle 6: 13-3-6-0-13
- Cycle 7: 13-3-6-2-13
- Cycle 8: 4-9-13-8-4
- Cycle 9: 4-9-14-3-4
- Cycle 10: 5-11-7-8-5
- Cycle 11: 5-4-9-14-5
- Cycle 12: 6-5-11-7-6
- Cycle 13: 6-5-4-2-6
- Cycle 14: 6-2-8-12-6
- Cycle 15: 6-2-4-9-6
- Cycle 16: 6-0-13-9-6
- Cycle 17: 8-12-3-14-8
- Cycle 18: 8-12-10-7-8
- Cycle 19: 9-14-10-3-9
- Cycle 20: 9-14-5-11-9
- Cycle 21: 9-4-2-6-9
- Cycle 22: 9-4-5-11-9
- Cycle 23: 9-7-11-5-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <10, (11, 14), 5>
- <10, (7, 11), 5>
- <10, (7, 8), 12>
- <13, (8, 7), 11>
- <13, (8, 12), 10>
- <13, (6, 2), 0>
- <13, (6, 3), 2>
- <4, (9, 13), 8>
- <4, (9, 14), 3>
- <5, (11, 7), 8>
- <5, (4, 9), 14>
- <6, (5, 11), 7>
- <6, (4, 2), 5>
- <6, (2, 8), 12>
- <6, (2, 4), 9>
- <8, (12, 3), 14>
- <8, (10, 7), 12>
- <9, (14, 10), 3>
- <9, (14, 5), 11>
- <9, (4, 2), 6>
- <9, (4, 5), 11>
- <9, (7, 11), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 23 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. Therefore, the final count is [23].
