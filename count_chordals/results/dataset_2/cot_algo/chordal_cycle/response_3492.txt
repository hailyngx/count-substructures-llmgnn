Step 2: Checking for chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <7, (2, 17), 8, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (11, 12), 1, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (4, 12), 1, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, (7, 17), 8, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, (4, 12), 11, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <0, (4, 12), 1, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <0, (4, 12), 11, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <13, (8, 1), 12, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <13, (8, 1), 12, 11>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 24 total cycles, out of which there are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles.
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [15].
