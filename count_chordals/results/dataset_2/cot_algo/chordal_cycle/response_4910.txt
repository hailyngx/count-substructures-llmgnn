Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 3) (8, 0) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 11) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 7, 8, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 13, 0, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 7, 6, 2, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 2, 6, 11, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 14, 12, 11, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 2, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 2, 6, 7, 1)
- Cycle 8: (2, 6, 11, 12, 2)
- Cycle 9: (6, 7, 8, 12, 6)
- Cycle 10: (7, 8, 1, 2, 7)
- Cycle 11: (7, 6, 2, 4, 7)
- Cycle 12: (8, 7, 6, 2, 8)
- Cycle 13: (8, 7, 1, 14, 8)
- Cycle 14: (0, 13, 5, 7, 0)
- Cycle 15: (0, 13, 3, 10, 0)
- Cycle 16: (0, 4, 2, 6, 0)
- Cycle 17: (9, 4, 0, 14, 9)
- Cycle 18: (9, 4, 2, 6, 9)
- Cycle 19: (9, 14, 12, 11, 9)
- Cycle 20: (12, 11, 2, 4, 12)
- Cycle 21: (12, 14, 6, 2, 12)
- Cycle 22: (13, 0, 4, 9, 13)
- Cycle 23: (13, 5, 7, 6, 13)
- Cycle 24: (13, 1, 2, 6, 13)
- Cycle 25: (14, 9, 3, 13, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (2, 4), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (11, 2), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, (6, 11), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are a total of [22] chordless cycles in the given graph.
