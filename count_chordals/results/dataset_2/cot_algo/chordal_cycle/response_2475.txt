Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 15) (21, 7) (21, 27) (21, 25) (21, 2) (21, 15) (18, 10) (18, 24) (22, 3) (28, 29) (28, 17) (28, 13) (28, 25) (29, 28) (29, 8) (29, 25) (17, 28) (17, 2) (1, 25) (1, 4) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 27) (8, 29) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 27) (9, 8) (9, 12) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 23) (6, 0) (24, 18) (24, 3) (11, 14) (11, 4) (11, 15) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 25) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (0, 13) (10, 18) (10, 3) (3, 22) (3, 8) (3, 24) (3, 10) (23, 16) (23, 2) (23, 4) (20, 12) (12, 9) (12, 0) (12, 20) (12, 15) (15, 7) (15, 21) (15, 11) (15, 12) (25, 21) (25, 28) (25, 29) (25, 1) (25, 14) (27, 21) (27, 19) (27, 8) (13, 28) (13, 16) (13, 0) (13, 4) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 23) (4, 13) (2, 21) (2, 17) (2, 16) (2, 23) 

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: <7, 21, 25, 15>
- Cycle 2: <8, 29, 25, 14>
- Cycle 3: <16, 13, 0, 4>
- Cycle 4: <2, 21, 25, 28>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (21, 15)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (29, 14)
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [2].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<7, 21, 25, 15> with chord (21, 15)
<8, 29, 25, 14> with chord (29, 14)
