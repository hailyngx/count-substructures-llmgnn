Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 14) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 12) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 13) (2, 10) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 11) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-13-2-5 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 2: 4-5-9-6-4 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 3: 4-11-9-5-4 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 4: 4-7-10-13-4 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 5: 0-6-9-5-0 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 6: 2-5-9-10-2 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 7: 1-3-7-14-1 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 8: 8-9-10-12-8 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 9: 2-13-8-12-2 (chordless cycle)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <5, 9, (13, 2), 5>
- <4, 5, (9, 6), 4>
- <4, 11, (9, 5), 4>
- <4, 7, (10, 13), 4>
- <0, 6, (9, 5), 0>
- <2, 5, (9, 10), 2>
- <1, 3, (7, 14), 1>
- <8, 9, (10, 12), 8>
- <2, 13, (8, 12), 2>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles, we find that there are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, 9, 13, 2>
- <4, 5, 9, 6>
- <4, 11, 9, 5>
- <4, 7, 10, 13>
- <0, 6, 9, 5>
- <2, 5, 9, 10>
- <1, 3, 7, 14>
- <8, 9, 10, 12>
- <2, 13, 8, 12>

Therefore, the final count is [9].
