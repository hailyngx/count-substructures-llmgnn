Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 21) (7, 16) (7, 29) (7, 2) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 12) (21, 14) (23, 11) (23, 24) (17, 29) (17, 27) (17, 2) (29, 7) (29, 17) (29, 25) (29, 18) (28, 21) (28, 13) (28, 10) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 0) (11, 5) (13, 28) (13, 25) (13, 15) (14, 21) (14, 26) (26, 7) (26, 14) (26, 4) (16, 7) (16, 0) (16, 27) (18, 29) (18, 19) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 6) (4, 9) (4, 26) (4, 22) (4, 3) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 10) (22, 3) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 5) (24, 23) (24, 11) (24, 12) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 25) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 20) (6, 19) (6, 27) (27, 17) (27, 16) (27, 6) (12, 21) (12, 24) (12, 1) (20, 5) (20, 3) (15, 13) (15, 25) (25, 29) (25, 13) (25, 2) (25, 15) (1, 9) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 22) (3, 20) (10, 28) (10, 22) (10, 5) 

Response:
After listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<7, 21, 28, 13>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
