Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-2-4-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-4-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-5-7-4-1
- Cycle 4: 2-3-4-5-2
- Cycle 5: 2-4-7-5-2
- Cycle 6: 2-4-3-6-2
- Cycle 7: 2-6-0-9-2
- Cycle 8: 3-4-7-5-3
- Cycle 9: 3-4-2-6-3
- Cycle 10: 3-6-0-9-3
- Cycle 11: 5-4-7-1-5
- Cycle 12: 5-7-4-1-5
- Cycle 13: 5-7-8-1-5
- Cycle 14: 0-6-3-9-0
- Cycle 15: 0-6-2-8-0
- Cycle 16: 0-9-8-5-0

Step 2: 
Identifying chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1 <2, (1, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2 <4, (7, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3 <4, (3, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4 <7, (4, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5 <9, (6, 0)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6 <0, (9, 8)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [10]

Final Result: 
- Chordal 4-cycles: [6]
- Chordless 4-cycles: [10]
