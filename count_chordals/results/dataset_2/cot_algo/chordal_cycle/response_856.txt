This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 24) (1, 23) (21, 1) (21, 28) (21, 0) (3, 15) (3, 22) (15, 1) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 29) (15, 17) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 6) (11, 17) (0, 21) (0, 26) (0, 13) (20, 26) (20, 13) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 9) (28, 12) (29, 15) (29, 16) (29, 25) (29, 23) (22, 3) (22, 2) (22, 19) (22, 6) (26, 0) (26, 20) (26, 8) (17, 15) (17, 11) (6, 11) (6, 22) (6, 12) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 16) (19, 22) (19, 5) (19, 7) (2, 22) (2, 23) (2, 27) (25, 29) (25, 27) (25, 12) (27, 2) (27, 25) (27, 14) (27, 23) (8, 10) (8, 28) (8, 26) (8, 7) (7, 19) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 18) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 28) (24, 1) (16, 29) (16, 5) (18, 7) (23, 1) (23, 29) (23, 2) (23, 27) (14, 27) (14, 7) (14, 12) (13, 0) (13, 20) (12, 28) (12, 6) (12, 25) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- <1, 21, 28, 8, 10> (5-cycle)
- <1, 15, 3, 22, 2> (5-cycle)
- <1, 15, 9, 10, 5> (5-cycle)
- <1, 15, 17, 11, 6> (5-cycle)
- <1, 15, 29, 25, 27> (5-cycle)
- <1, 24, 23, 29, 25> (5-cycle)
- <21, 28, 8, 10, 9> (5-cycle)
- <21, 28, 9, 15, 17> (5-cycle)
- <21, 28, 12, 6, 22> (5-cycle)
- <21, 0, 26, 8, 10> (5-cycle)
- <21, 0, 13, 20, 26> (5-cycle)
- <3, 15, 29, 25, 27> (5-cycle)
- <15, 17, 11, 6, 22> (5-cycle)
- <10, 11, 17, 15, 9> (5-cycle)
- <10, 8, 28, 21, 0> (5-cycle)
- <11, 17, 15, 29, 25> (5-cycle)
- <0, 26, 8, 28, 21> (5-cycle)
- <20, 26, 8, 28, 21> (5-cycle)
- <22, 6, 12, 28, 21> (5-cycle)
- <26, 0, 21, 1, 24> (5-cycle)
- <28, 8, 26, 20, 13> (5-cycle)
- <29, 15, 1, 24, 23> (5-cycle)
- <15, 1, 21, 0, 13> (5-cycle)
- <6, 11, 17, 15, 9> (5-cycle)
- <5, 10, 8, 28, 21> (5-cycle)
- <19, 22, 6, 11, 17> (5-cycle)
- <2, 22, 6, 11, 17> (5-cycle)
- <25, 29, 15, 1, 21> (5-cycle)
- <27, 25, 29, 15, 1> (5-cycle)
- <8, 28, 21, 1, 15> (5-cycle)
- <7, 19, 22, 6, 11> (5-cycle)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 21, 28, 8, 10> has a chord (21, 8)
- <21, 0, 26, 8, 10> has a chord (0, 8)
- <10, 8, 28, 21, 0> has a chord (8, 21)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 21, 28, 8, 10>
- <21, 0, 26, 8, 10>
- <10, 8, 28, 21, 0>
