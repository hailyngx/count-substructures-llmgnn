Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 20) (1, 28) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 29) (21, 4) (15, 9) (15, 24) (15, 16) (27, 21) (27, 26) (27, 5) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 17) (22, 18) (22, 19) (22, 16) (22, 29) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 29) (8, 17) (23, 27) (23, 8) (23, 0) (24, 15) (24, 26) (26, 27) (26, 24) (26, 7) (0, 23) (0, 19) (7, 26) (7, 29) (7, 14) (16, 15) (16, 22) (16, 28) (16, 9) (28, 1) (28, 16) (28, 17) (28, 9) (14, 7) (14, 11) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 25) (19, 3) (17, 18) (17, 8) (17, 28) (25, 19) (25, 9) (25, 13) (11, 14) (11, 20) (4, 21) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 10) (2, 10) (5, 27) (5, 8) (5, 20) (29, 21) (29, 22) (29, 8) (29, 7) (9, 15) (9, 16) (9, 28) (9, 25) (20, 1) (20, 11) (20, 5) (13, 25) (13, 12) (13, 3) (6, 18) (10, 12) (10, 2) (3, 19) (3, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (1, 21, 4, 12, 2, 10) 
        - Cycle 2: (15, 9, 25, 13, 3, 19, 0, 23, 8, 5, 20, 11, 14, 7, 26, 24)
        - Cycle 3: (27, 21, 29, 7, 14, 11, 20, 5, 8, 23, 0, 19, 3, 13, 12)
        - Cycle 4: (18, 22, 16, 28, 17, 8, 23, 0, 19, 25, 9, 15, 16)
        - Cycle 5: (22, 19, 0, 23, 8, 27, 26, 7, 14, 11, 20, 5, 29)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1: <1, (4, 12), 2, 10>
        - Cycle 2: <9, (25, 13), 3, 19> 
        - Cycle 3: <27, (29, 7), 14, 11> 
        - Cycle 4: <22, (28, 17), 16, 8> 
        - Cycle 5: <22, (27, 26), 7, 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [5].
