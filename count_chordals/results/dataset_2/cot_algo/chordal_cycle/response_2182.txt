        - One cycle of length 4: (7, 18, 10, 12, 8, 7)
        - One cycle of length 4: (7, 10, 4, 3, 7)
        - One cycle of length 4: (7, 10, 4, 18, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - The cycle (1, 13, 14, 5, 1) has exactly one chord: (13, 5)
        - The cycle (2, 1, 13, 15, 2) has exactly one chord: (1, 15)
        - The cycle (5, 2, 1, 13, 5) has exactly one chord: (2, 13)
        - The cycle (7, 5, 18, 11, 7) has exactly one chord: (5, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - In this graph, there are 36 chordal 4-cycles in total.

Therefore, the final answer is [36].
Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
        <1, 13, 14, 5>
        <2, 1, 13, 15>
        <5, 2, 1, 13>
        <7, 5, 18, 11>
