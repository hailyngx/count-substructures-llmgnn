Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 16) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 14) (14, 7) (14, 17) (14, 3) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 0) (10, 17) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 8) (11, 15) (2, 12) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (19, 11) (19, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 8) (1, 9) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (15, 11) (15, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 18) (16, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 16) (0, 4) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 4, 7, 14, 3> with chord (5, 14).
- Cycle 2: <5, 4, 7, 14, 17> with chord (5, 17).
- Cycle 3: <5, 4, 0, 6, 1> with chord (5, 1).
- Cycle 4: <9, 1, 6, 8, 10> with chord (9, 8).
- Cycle 5: <9, 1, 19, 11, 15> with chord (9, 11).
- Cycle 6: <9, 13, 12, 3, 14> with chord (9, 3).
- Cycle 7: <4, 0, 6, 8, 10> with chord (4, 8).
- Cycle 8: <7, 14, 17, 10, 11> with chord (7, 10).
- Cycle 9: <7, 4, 0, 18, 16> with chord (7, 18).
- Cycle 10: <14, 17, 0, 6, 1> with chord (14, 1).
- Cycle 11: <17, 10, 11, 15, 2> with chord (17, 15).
- Cycle 12: <17, 14, 3, 12, 13> with chord (17, 12).
- Cycle 13: <10, 11, 19, 1, 6> with chord (10, 1).
- Cycle 14: <10, 17, 14, 3, 12> with chord (10, 14).
- Cycle 15: <10, 8, 6, 0, 4> with chord (10, 6).
- Cycle 16: <11, 19, 1, 6, 0> with chord (11, 1).
- Cycle 17: <11, 10, 17, 0, 18> with chord (11, 17).
- Cycle 18: <11, 8, 6, 0, 4> with chord (11, 6).
- Cycle 19: <2, 15, 11, 19, 1> with chord (2, 11).
- Cycle 20: <2, 16, 13, 12, 3> with chord (2, 13).
- Cycle 21: <18, 0, 6, 8, 10> with chord (18, 8).
- Cycle 22: <18, 16, 13, 12, 3> with chord (18, 13).

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
From the above-listed cycles, all cycles already have exactly one chord in them.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
As all identified cycles have exactly one chord, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
