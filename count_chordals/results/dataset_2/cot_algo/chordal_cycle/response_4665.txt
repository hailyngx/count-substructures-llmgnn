Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 6) (17, 5) (10, 9) (2, 15) (2, 4) (8, 0) (1, 0) (1, 18) (1, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 13) (7, 5) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 19) (13, 6) (15, 2) (15, 12) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 16) (16, 0) (16, 19) (16, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 12) (12, 15) (12, 4) (12, 11) (18, 1) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 11) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 18) (9, 11) (3, 16) (3, 6) (11, 12) (11, 18) (11, 6) (11, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        <0, 8, 1, 7>
        <0, 1, 7, 13>
        <0, 16, 3, 6>
        <0, 16, 19, 18>
        <1, 7, 13, 6>
        <1, 7, 14, 9>
        <1, 18, 19, 16>
        <2, 4, 5, 7>
        <2, 4, 12, 15>
        <4, 5, 7, 1>
        <4, 5, 13, 6>
        <4, 12, 15, 2>
        <5, 7, 13, 19>
        <5, 13, 19, 18>
        <6, 11, 12, 15>
        <6, 13, 19, 18>
        <7, 13, 19, 16>
        <9, 10, 9, 18>
        <9, 11, 6, 3>
        <11, 12, 4, 2>
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <0, 8, 1, 7> has chord (0, 7)
        - <0, 1, 7, 13> has chord (1, 7)
        - <0, 16, 3, 6> has chord (16, 6)
        - <0, 16, 19, 18> has chord (16, 19)
        - <1, 7, 13, 6> has chord (7, 13)
        - <1, 7, 14, 9> has chord (7, 9)
        - <1, 18, 19, 16> has chord (18, 19)
        - <2, 4, 5, 7> has chord (4, 5)
        - <2, 4, 12, 15> has chord (4, 12)
        - <4, 5, 7, 1> has chord (5, 7)
        - <4, 5, 13, 6> has chord (5, 6)
        - <4, 12, 15, 2> has chord (12, 15)
        - <5, 7, 13, 19> has chord (7, 13)
        - <5, 13, 19, 18> has chord (13, 19)
        - <6, 11, 12, 15> has chord (11, 12)
        - <6, 13, 19, 18> has chord (13, 18)
        - <7, 13, 19, 16> has chord (13, 19)
        - <9, 10, 9, 18> has chord (9, 9)
        - <9, 11, 6, 3> has chord (11, 6)
        - <11, 12, 4, 2> has chord (12, 4)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are [6] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
