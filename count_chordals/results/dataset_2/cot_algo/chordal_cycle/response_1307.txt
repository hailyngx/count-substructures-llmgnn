Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 8) (11, 15) (16, 1) (16, 9) (16, 5) (16, 6) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 13) (15, 14) (4, 7) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 19) (9, 16) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 10) (17, 0) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 14) (18, 15) (18, 9) (18, 2) (8, 11) (8, 5) (19, 6) (19, 14) (19, 0) (5, 16) (5, 8) (5, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 5) (12, 0) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 19) (14, 1) (14, 13) (0, 9) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 12) (13, 15) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (3, 7, 2, 14, 1)
- Cycle 2: (11, 15, 14, 1, 16)
- Cycle 3: (16, 1, 14, 15, 18)
- Cycle 4: (16, 1, 14, 19, 0)
- Cycle 5: (16, 1, 14, 2, 18)
- Cycle 6: (16, 1, 14, 13, 15)
- Cycle 7: (16, 1, 14, 2, 7)
- Cycle 8: (16, 1, 14, 19, 0)
- Cycle 9: (16, 1, 14, 15, 13)
- Cycle 10: (16, 1, 14, 2, 7)
- Cycle 11: (16, 1, 14, 15, 13)
- Cycle 12: (16, 1, 14, 13, 15)
- Cycle 13: (16, 1, 14, 2, 18)
- Cycle 14: (16, 1, 14, 19, 0)
- Cycle 15: (16, 1, 14, 15, 18)
- Cycle 16: (16, 9, 18, 2, 7)
- Cycle 17: (16, 9, 18, 15, 14)
- Cycle 18: (16, 9, 18, 2, 14)
- Cycle 19: (16, 9, 18, 15, 13)
- Cycle 20: (16, 9, 18, 2, 7)
- Cycle 21: (16, 9, 18, 15, 13)
- Cycle 22: (16, 9, 18, 13, 15)
- Cycle 23: (16, 9, 18, 2, 14)
- Cycle 24: (16, 6, 19, 14, 1)
- Cycle 25: (16, 6, 19, 0, 12)
- Cycle 26: (16, 6, 19, 14, 13)
- Cycle 27: (16, 6, 19, 0, 12)
- Cycle 28: (16, 6, 19, 14, 1)
- Cycle 29: (16, 6, 19, 14, 13)
- Cycle 30: (16, 6, 19, 12, 0)
- Cycle 31: (16, 6, 19, 14, 1)
- Cycle 32: (16, 6, 19, 0, 12)
- Cycle 33: (16, 6, 19, 14, 13)
- Cycle 34: (16, 6, 19, 0, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
The chordal 4-cycles in this graph are:
- <3, 7, 2, (14, 1)>
- <11, 15, 14, (1, 16)>
- <16, 1, 14, (15, 18)> 
- <16, 1, 14, (19, 0)>
- <16, 1, 14, (2, 18)>
- <16, 1, 14, (13, 15)>
- <16, 1, 14, (2, 7)>
- <16, 9, 18, (2, 7)>
- <16, 9, 18, (15, 14)>
- <16, 6, 19, (14, 1)>
- <16, 6, 19, (0, 12)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, hence the final count is [10].
