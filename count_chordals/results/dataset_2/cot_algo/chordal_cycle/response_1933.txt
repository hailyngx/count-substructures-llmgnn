Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 25) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 15) (5, 9) (5, 25) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (3, 1) (3, 21) (3, 17) (20, 25) (20, 24) (25, 1) (25, 5) (25, 20) (25, 23) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 16) (18, 13) (22, 18) (22, 0) (22, 29) (12, 19) (27, 11) (27, 17) (27, 19) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 13) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 2) (28, 21) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 17) (2, 11) (8, 9) (8, 2) (29, 22) (29, 6) (29, 24) (0, 22) (0, 4) (0, 16) (13, 18) (13, 7) (13, 17) (17, 3) (17, 27) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 15) (10, 9) (10, 26) (14, 9) (14, 26) (14, 15) (26, 10) (26, 14) (26, 11) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (11, 27) (11, 2) (11, 26) (23, 25) (23, 6) (23, 19) (24, 20) (24, 29) (24, 19) (6, 7) (6, 29) (6, 23) (15, 21) (15, 17) (15, 14) (15, 16) (19, 12) (19, 27) (19, 23) (19, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 21, 25, 1)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 14, 26, 11, 27, 19, 24, 20, 25, 5)
- Cycle 3: (18, 22, 29, 24, 20, 25, 23, 19, 12, 18)
- Cycle 4: (4, 2, 8, 9, 5, 25, 20, 24, 29, 22, 18, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 5, 25, 23, 19, 27, 17, 13, 7)
- Cycle 6: (0, 4, 18, 22, 29, 24, 19, 27, 17, 3, 21, 15, 16, 0)
- Cycle 7: (6, 7, 13, 18, 22, 29, 24, 19, 23, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (21, 25), 3>
- <5, (9, 14), 26>
- <18, (22, 29), 24>
- <4, (8, 9), 5>
- <7, (13, 18), 22>
- <0, (16, 19), 27>
- <6, (13, 18), 22>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
