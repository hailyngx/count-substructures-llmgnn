Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 13) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 14) (8, 0) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 13) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 14, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 9, 2, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 13, 3, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 3, 14, 2, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 3, 10, 11, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 10, 8, 7, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 14, 12, 1, 5)
- Cycle 8: (9, 2, 13, 4, 9)
- Cycle 9: (4, 7, 11, 10, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 13, 3, 10, 4)
- Cycle 11: (7, 11, 0, 6, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 1, 12, 11, 7)
- Cycle 13: (1, 12, 0, 6, 1)
- Cycle 14: (3, 13, 2, 14, 3)
- Cycle 15: (10, 8, 0, 6, 10)
- Cycle 16: (8, 14, 12, 1, 8)
- Cycle 17: (12, 0, 8, 14, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <5, (9, 2), 14, 5>
- <5, (4, 9), 2, 5>
- <5, 4, (13, 3), 5>
- <5, (3, 14), 2, 5>
- <5, 3, (10, 11), 5>
- <5, 10, (8, 7), 5>
- <5, 14, (12, 1), 5>
- <9, 2, (13, 4), 9>
- <4, (7, 11), 10, 4>
- <4, 13, (3, 10), 4>
- <7, (11, 0), 6, 7>
- <7, 1, (12, 11), 7>
- <1, 12, (0, 6), 1>
- <3, 13, (2, 14), 3>
- <10, 8, (0, 6), 10>
- <8, 14, (12, 1), 8>
- <12, 0, (8, 14), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [16].
