Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-8-5-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-8-7-0-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-9-8-1
- Cycle 4: 2-6-8-1-2
- Cycle 5: 2-1-7-9-2
- Cycle 6: 2-1-8-5-2
- Cycle 7: 3-6-8-1-3
- Cycle 8: 3-2-1-7-3
- Cycle 9: 3-5-4-6-3
- Cycle 10: 0-7-9-8-0
- Cycle 11: 0-6-8-1-0
- Cycle 12: 0-3-2-1-0
- Cycle 13: 4-9-7-0-4
- Cycle 14: 4-2-3-5-4

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (5, 4), (8, 1)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (6, 2)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (7, 9)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (8, 5)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (6, 3)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (8, 9)
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: (0, 1)
- Cycle 12 has 1 chord: (2, 3)
- Cycle 13 has 1 chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 14 has 1 chord: (3, 5)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (5, 4), (8, 1)>
<2, (7, 9)>
