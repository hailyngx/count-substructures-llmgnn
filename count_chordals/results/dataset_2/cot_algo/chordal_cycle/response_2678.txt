Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 17) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 1) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 13) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 5) (13, 16) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 12) (0, 3) (0, 18) (16, 13) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 0) (7, 10) (7, 11) (14, 5) (14, 15) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 15) (4, 17) (4, 1) (4, 19) (12, 1) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- 3-11-6-9
- 3-11-13-16
- 3-5-13-16
- 10-7-11-13
- 10-1-12-14
- 6-8-12-14
- 9-2-15-19

Step 2:

Among the cycles listed above, the only cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <3, (11, 6), 9>

Step 3:

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <3, (11, 6), 9>.
