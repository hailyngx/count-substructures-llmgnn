Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (16, 5) (14, 18) (14, 19) (17, 0) (17, 12) (17, 18) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 15) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 18) (10, 3) (10, 15) (10, 8) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 0) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 2) (15, 5) (12, 17) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 8) (18, 14) (18, 17) (18, 3) (19, 14) (4, 9) (13, 11) (5, 16) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 12, 2, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 7, 11, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 3, 8, 2, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 3, 18, 17, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 3, 5, 16, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 11, 13, 14, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 11, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 11, 7, 6, 1)
- Cycle 11: (2, 0, 7, 11, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 0, 5, 3, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 0, 17, 18, 2)
- Cycle 14: (2, 8, 3, 1, 2)
- Cycle 15: (2, 8, 12, 6, 2)
- Cycle 16: (2, 8, 10, 15, 2)
- Cycle 17: (2, 12, 6, 9, 2)
- Cycle 18: (2, 12, 17, 0, 2)
- Cycle 19: (2, 15, 9, 4, 2)
- Cycle 20: (3, 1, 6, 12, 3)
- Cycle 21: (3, 1, 11, 13, 3)
- Cycle 22: (3, 5, 0, 17, 3)
- Cycle 23: (3, 5, 15, 9, 3)
- Cycle 24: (3, 8, 2, 12, 3)
- Cycle 25: (3, 8, 10, 15, 3)
- Cycle 26: (3, 18, 17, 0, 3)
- Cycle 27: (4, 9, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 28: (5, 0, 7, 6, 5)

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- <1, (6, 9), 4, 1>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need further clarification.
