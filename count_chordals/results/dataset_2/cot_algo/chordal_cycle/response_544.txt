Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- 4-cycle: 1-6-4-7-1
- 4-cycle: 1-4-8-5-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- 4-cycle: 1-6-4-7-1 has 2 chords (6, 7) and (4, 1) -> not a chordal 4-cycle
- 4-cycle: 1-4-8-5-1 has 2 chords (4, 8) and (5, 1) -> not a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Final result: [0]
