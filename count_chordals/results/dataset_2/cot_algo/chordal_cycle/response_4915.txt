Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 13) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 11) (12, 9) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (11, 12) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 1) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5-7-6-4-5
- Cycle 2: 5-13-7-9-5
- Cycle 3: 5-10-7-9-5
- Cycle 4: 13-9-1-2-13
- Cycle 5: 4-6-0-14-4
- Cycle 6: 4-6-7-9-4
- Cycle 7: 4-9-1-2-4
- Cycle 8: 6-7-12-2-6
- Cycle 9: 6-4-14-2-6
- Cycle 10: 0-6-7-9-0
- Cycle 11: 0-14-2-1-0
- Cycle 12: 14-8-3-10-14
- Cycle 13: 14-0-6-8-14
- Cycle 14: 14-2-9-1-14
- Cycle 15: 7-12-2-13-7
- Cycle 16: 7-9-13-2-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <5, (7, 6), 4>
- <5, (13, 7), 9>
- <5, (10, 7), 9>
- <13, (9, 1), 2>
- <4, (6, 0), 14>
- <4, (6, 7), 9>
- <4, (9, 1), 2>
- <6, (7, 12), 2>
- <6, (4, 14), 2>
- <0, (6, 7), 9>
- <0, (14, 2), 1>
- <14, (8, 3), 10>
- <14, (0, 6), 8>
- <14, (2, 9), 1>
- <7, (12, 2), 13>
- <7, (9, 13), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the final number inside brackets is [16].
