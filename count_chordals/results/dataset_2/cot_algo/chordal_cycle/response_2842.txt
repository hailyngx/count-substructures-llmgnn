Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 16) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 6) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 8) (13, 4) (17, 3) (17, 16) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 19) (16, 3) (16, 17) (16, 0) (18, 15) (18, 19) (18, 1) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 6) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 18) (1, 12) (1, 14) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 5) (9, 0) (9, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 11) (6, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (3, 6, 15, 19) => (3, 6), (6, 15), (15, 19), (19, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 16, 0, 7) => (3, 16), (16, 0), (0, 7), (7, 3)
- Cycle 3: (11, 6, 15, 19) => (11, 6), (6, 15), (15, 19), (19, 11)
- Cycle 4: (11, 6, 19, 7) => (11, 6), (6, 19), (19, 7), (7, 11)
- Cycle 5: (11, 6, 3, 17) => (11, 6), (6, 3), (3, 17), (17, 11)
- Cycle 6: (11, 6, 3, 16) => (11, 6), (6, 3), (3, 16), (16, 11)
- Cycle 7: (11, 6, 16, 0) => (11, 6), (6, 16), (16, 0), (0, 11)
- Cycle 8: (11, 6, 15, 6) => (11, 6), (6, 15), (15, 6), (6, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord

Out of the cycles listed above, the following is the unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- Chordal cycle <3, (6, 15), 19)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found

The number of chordless cycles found is [7].
