Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 1) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 4) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 0) (0, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 8) (14, 10) (14, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 4) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 2) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (6, 7, 12, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 12, 14, 9, 11, 5, 6)
- Cycle 3: (9, 11, 5, 13, 0, 13, 5, 11, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 11, 5, 12, 8, 10, 14, 11)
- Cycle 5: (9, 1, 7, 12, 8, 10, 1, 9)
- Cycle 6: (7, 1, 9, 11, 5, 12, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 1, 10, 8, 12, 7)
- Cycle 8: (5, 11, 9, 14, 12, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 12, 8, 1, 10, 5)
- Cycle 10: (13, 5, 12, 8, 10, 13)

Step 2:  
Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (7, 12)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (9, 11)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (5, 13)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (12, 8)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (10, 8)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (1, 10)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (11, 14)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (5, 12)
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (5, 10)

Step 3:  
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

- The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (7, 12), 6)>
<2, (9, 11), 5)>
<3, (5, 13), 0)>
<4, (12, 8), 10)>
<5, (10, 8), 5)>
<6, (1, 9), 7)>
<7, (1, 10), 8)>
<8, (11, 14), 5)>
<9, (5, 12), 8)>
<10, (5, 10), 13)>
