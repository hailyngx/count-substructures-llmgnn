Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 0) (15, 4) (10, 1) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 4) (17, 7) (7, 17) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 16) (19, 5) (19, 11) (19, 9) (9, 19) (9, 4) (4, 15) (4, 17) (4, 9) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 18) (1, 10) (1, 16) (1, 6) (1, 18) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (11, 5) (11, 19) (14, 3) (14, 18) (14, 13) (0, 15) (0, 17) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13) (13, 14) (13, 0) (13, 18) (18, 16) (18, 1) (18, 14) (18, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 4, 17) 
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 0, 17)
- Cycle 3: (3, 15, 4, 9) 
- Cycle 4: (3, 5, 19, 11) 
- Cycle 5: (3, 5, 16, 18) 
- Cycle 6: (15, 0, 17, 6) 
- Cycle 7: (17, 4, 9, 19) 
- Cycle 8: (17, 6, 1, 16) 
- Cycle 9: (17, 0, 13, 14) 
- Cycle 10: (7, 17, 4, 9) 
- Cycle 11: (8, 0, 13, 14) 
- Cycle 12: (8, 2, 5, 19)

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (6, 17), 16>
- <2, (6, 17), 18>
- <3, (15, 4), 17>
- <4, (15, 0), 17>
- <5, (5, 19), 11>
- <6, (5, 16), 18>
- <7, (17, 6), 1>
- <8, (17, 0), 13>
- <9, (4, 9), 17>
- <10, (0, 13), 14>
- <11, (2, 5), 19>

Step 3:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final count is [11].
