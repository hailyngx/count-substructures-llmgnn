Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 12) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 4) (6, 7) (6, 12) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 7) (8, 19) (8, 10) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 12) (11, 3) (11, 18) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 3) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 8) (19, 3) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 16) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 16) (7, 10) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 18) (1, 9) (1, 4) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 18) (18, 11) (18, 16) (18, 10) (15, 5) (15, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (5, 9, 1, 4)
- (5, 13, 2, 7)
- (5, 15, 17, 4)
- (9, 12, 3, 0)
- (14, 10, 7, 6)
- (17, 4, 12, 3)
- (6, 7, 2, 13)
- (2, 19, 14, 10)
- (8, 10, 7, 16)
- (0, 3, 12, 4)
- (3, 13, 5, 2)
- (11, 18, 16, 7)
- (19, 8, 10, 14)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle (5, 13, 2, 7) has a chord (13, 7)
- Cycle (5, 15, 17, 4) has a chord (15, 4)
- Cycle (9, 12, 3, 0) has a chord (12, 0)
- Cycle (6, 7, 2, 13) has a chord (7, 2)
- Cycle (3, 13, 5, 2) has a chord (13, 5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles found: [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, 9, 1, 4>
- <14, 10, 7, 6>
- <17, 4, 12, 3>
- <2, 19, 14, 10>
- <8, 10, 7, 16>
- <0, 3, 12, 4>
- <11, 18, 16, 7>
- <19, 8, 10, 14>
