Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 5) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 7) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 13) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (4, 9) (4, 3) (12, 2) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 13) (3, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (0, 9, 6, 8, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 9, 6, 13, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 10, 11, 7, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 10, 5, 13, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 11, 7, 13, 0)
- Cycle 6: (3, 6, 9, 4, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 6, 8, 3, 10)
- Cycle 8: (3, 10, 14, 11, 7, 13, 5, 3)
- Cycle 9: (4, 9, 6, 8, 3, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, (13, 6), 8, 3>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 8 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
