Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 12) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 14) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (15, 11) (15, 8) (15, 12) (14, 16) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 10) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 4) (9, 13) (10, 17) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 5) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 18) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 19) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 19) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 10) (12, 5) (18, 9) (18, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (19, 7) (19, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (3, 9, 13, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 6, 8, 2, 1)
- Cycle 3: (7, 19, 1, 2, 8, 6)
- Cycle 4: (10, 12, 15, 8, 6)
- Cycle 5: (12, 5, 7, 10, 17)
- Cycle 6: (14, 17, 10, 7, 0, 18)
- Cycle 7: (0, 3, 9, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 2 has one chord: (8, 1)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (12, 8)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (5, 10)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (0, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <3, (9, 18)>
- <4, (12, 8)>
- <5, (5, 10)>
