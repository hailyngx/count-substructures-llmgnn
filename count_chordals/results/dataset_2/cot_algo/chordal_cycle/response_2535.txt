Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 22) (6, 12) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 27) (14, 23) (14, 20) (14, 10) (17, 20) (17, 12) (17, 5) (2, 29) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 25) (29, 2) (29, 28) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 24) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 12) (7, 18) (7, 26) (21, 24) (28, 29) (28, 3) (28, 13) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 25) (18, 7) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 23) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 26) (8, 22) (22, 6) (22, 8) (22, 5) (13, 28) (13, 26) (13, 15) (26, 7) (26, 18) (26, 8) (26, 13) (26, 1) (20, 14) (20, 17) (20, 12) (16, 10) (16, 8) (16, 1) (3, 28) (19, 2) (19, 11) (23, 14) (23, 18) (12, 6) (12, 17) (12, 11) (12, 20) (0, 6) (0, 11) (1, 10) (1, 26) (1, 16) (1, 27) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 22) (5, 25) (25, 2) (25, 4) (25, 5) (15, 13) (15, 24) (27, 9) (27, 1) (24, 10) (24, 21) (24, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 6 -> 22 -> 5 -> 17 -> 20 -> 14 -> 23 -> 18 -> 7 -> 26 -> 1 -> 16 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 17 -> 5 -> 4 -> 25 -> 2 -> 8 -> 22 -> 6
- Cycle 2: 16 -> 10 -> 1 -> 26 -> 7 -> 18 -> 4 -> 5 -> 25 -> 2 -> 19 -> 11 -> 12 -> 17 -> 20 -> 14 -> 10 -> 16
- Cycle 3: 6 -> 22 -> 8 -> 9 -> 27 -> 1 -> 26 -> 18 -> 23 -> 14 -> 20 -> 17 -> 12 -> 11 -> 0 -> 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: <6, 14>
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: <5, 19>
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: <17, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
