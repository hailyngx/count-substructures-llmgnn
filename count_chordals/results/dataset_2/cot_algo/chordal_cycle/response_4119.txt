Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 4, 7, 0, 9)
- Cycle 3: (4, 6, 8, 1, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 9, 2, 3, 7)
- Cycle 5: (6, 4, 9, 2, 6)
- Cycle 6: (2, 3, 7, 4, 2)
- Cycle 7: (8, 1, 5, 9, 8)
- Cycle 8: (0, 7, 4, 3, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, (5, 6), 9> is a chordal 4-cycle with chords 5, 6.
- <2, (4, 7), 9> is a chordal 4-cycle with chords 4, 7.
- <3, (6, 9), 4> is a chordal 4-cycle with chords 6, 9.
- <4, (7, 2), 9> is a chordal 4-cycle with chords 7, 2.
- <5, (4, 9), 6> is a chordal 4-cycle with chords 4, 9.
- <6, (2, 3), 7> is a chordal 4-cycle with chords 2, 3.
- <7, (1, 5), 9> is a chordal 4-cycle with chords 1, 5.
- <8, (3, 4), 7> is a chordal 4-cycle with chords 3, 4.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
