Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more present in the given graph.

Step 2:
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, we cannot proceed to check for a chord in any cycle.

Step 3:
- As there are no cycles of length 4 or more, there are no chordal 4-cycles present in the given graph. Therefore, the count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
