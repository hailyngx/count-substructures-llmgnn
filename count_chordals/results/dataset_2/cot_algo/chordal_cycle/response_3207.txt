Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 18) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 18) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 0) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 0) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 8) (0, 12) (3, 17) (3, 7) (3, 10) (3, 18) (7, 9) (7, 14) (7, 3) (7, 19) (6, 14) (6, 15) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 15) (19, 7) (1, 16) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 1) (18, 11) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 12) (15, 16) (15, 8) (15, 6) (15, 2) (12, 0) (12, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- 0-8-9-5-0
- 0-8-15-6-14-7-3-17-18-12-0
- 0-8-15-2-13-10-3-7-14-6-0
- 0-8-15-2-11-16-1-14-7-3-0
- 0-8-15-6-14-1-16-11-2-13-0
- 0-13-2-15-8-0
- 0-13-10-1-14-6-15-2-0
- 2-11-16-1-14-7-3-17-18-12-2
- 2-13-10-1-14-6-15-8-0-12-2
- 2-13-10-3-7-14-1-16-11-2
- 3-10-13-2-15-8-0-12-18-3
- 3-10-1-14-6-15-8-0-12-18-3
- 6-15-8-0-12-18-17-14-7-3-6
- 6-15-2-13-10-3-7-14-1-16-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 0-8-9-5-0 has chord (8,5)
- Cycle 0-8-15-6-14-7-3-17-18-12-0 has chord (14,17)
- Cycle 0-8-15-2-13-10-3-7-14-6-0 has chord (2,10)
- Cycle 0-8-15-2-11-16-1-14-7-3-0 has chord (11,1)
- Cycle 0-8-15-6-14-1-16-11-2-13-0 has chord (16,13)
- Cycle 0-13-2-15-8-0 has chord (2,15)
- Cycle 0-13-10-1-14-6-15-2-0 has chord (10,1)
- Cycle 2-11-16-1-14-7-3-17-18-12-2 has chord (16,3)
- Cycle 2-13-10-1-14-6-15-8-0-12-2 has chord (1,15)
- Cycle 2-13-10-3-7-14-1-16-11-2 has chord (3,16)
- Cycle 3-10-13-2-15-8-0-12-18-3 has chord (13,8)
- Cycle 3-10-1-14-6-15-8-0-12-18-3 has chord (14,8)
- Cycle 6-15-8-0-12-18-17-14-7-3-6 has chord (18,7)
- Cycle 6-15-2-13-10-3-7-14-1-16-6 has chord (13,16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
