Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph where every edge in the cycle exists. 
- Some of the cycles include: {0, 9, 4, 8}, {2, 4, 8, 7}, {3, 8, 6, 9}, {1, 8, 7, 5}, {4, 2, 3, 6}, and more.

Step 2: 
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycle:
  <0, 4, 2, 3>, where the chord is (4, 3).

Step 3: 
- Counting the number of chordless cycles found gives us a final count of [0].
