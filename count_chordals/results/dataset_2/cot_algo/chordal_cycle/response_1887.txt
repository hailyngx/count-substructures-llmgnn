Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-2-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-6-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-5-4-1
- Cycle 4: 1-7-3-2-1
- Cycle 5: 2-3-7-5-2
- Cycle 6: 2-4-6-8-2
- Cycle 7: 2-6-5-9-2
- Cycle 8: 3-1-4-6-3
- Cycle 9: 3-2-6-8-3
- Cycle 10: 4-0-9-5-4
- Cycle 11: 4-1-7-3-4
- Cycle 12: 4-2-6-5-4
- Cycle 13: 4-8-6-2-4
- Cycle 14: 5-7-1-3-5
- Cycle 15: 5-9-2-6-5
- Cycle 16: 6-8-4-0-6
- Cycle 17: 7-1-4-5-7
- Cycle 18: 7-3-2-6-7
- Cycle 19: 8-6-2-4-8
- Cycle 20: 9-0-4-5-9

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (2, 6), 3>
- <1, (4, 6), 7>
- <1, (4, 7), 3>
- <1, (5, 9), 7>
- <2, (3, 7), 5>
- <2, (4, 8), 6>
- <2, (5, 9), 6>
- <3, (1, 6), 4>
- <3, (2, 8), 6>
- <4, (0, 9), 5>
- <4, (1, 7), 3>
- <4, (2, 6), 5>
- <4, (2, 8), 6>
- <5, (3, 7), 1>
- <5, (5, 6), 9>
- <6, (0, 8), 4>
- <7, (1, 4), 3>
- <7, (3, 6), 2>
- <8, (2, 4), 6>
- <9, (0, 5), 4>

Step 3:
There are a total of [20] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
