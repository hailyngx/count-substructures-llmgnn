Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 14) (14, 15) (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 18) (13, 17) (13, 8) (10, 15) (10, 14) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 16) (2, 0) (18, 8) (18, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (1, 15) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 6) (7, 16) (16, 2) (16, 7) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 5) (19, 10) (19, 11) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (12, 3) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (3, 0, 2, 5, 8, 14, 15, 10) with 7 edges
- Cycle 2: (3, 0, 2, 16, 7, 10, 15, 1) with 7 edges
- Cycle 3: (15, 10, 11, 19, 10) with 4 edges
- Cycle 4: (14, 15, 1, 15, 14) with 4 edges
- Cycle 5: (14, 15, 10, 11, 19, 10, 14) with 6 edges
- Cycle 6: (14, 8, 13, 17, 14) with 4 edges
- Cycle 7: (14, 8, 5, 2, 0, 3, 12, 6, 7, 16, 2, 4, 3, 0, 5, 8) with 16 edges

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <3, 0, 2, 5> has a chord (0, 5)
- <3, 0, 2, 16> has no chord
- <15, 10, 11, 19> has no chord
- <14, 15, 1, 15> has no chord
- <14, 15, 10, 11> has a chord (15, 11)
- <14, 8, 13, 17> has a chord (8, 17)
- <14, 8, 5, 2> has a chord (8, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 4 chordless cycles: <3, 0, 2, 16>, <15, 10, 11, 19>, <14, 15, 1, 15>, <14, 8, 13, 17>

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
