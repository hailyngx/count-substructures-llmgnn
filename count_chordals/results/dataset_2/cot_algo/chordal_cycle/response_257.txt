Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle 1: 4 - 1 - 7 - 6 - 4
2. Cycle 2: 4 - 1 - 5 - 8 - 4
3. Cycle 3: 4 - 3 - 8 - 2 - 4
4. Cycle 4: 4 - 3 - 9 - 7 - 4
5. Cycle 5: 7 - 6 - 5 - 8 - 7
6. Cycle 6: 7 - 1 - 5 - 8 - 7
7. Cycle 7: 7 - 1 - 4 - 3 - 7
8. Cycle 8: 7 - 2 - 8 - 5 - 7
9. Cycle 9: 8 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8
10. Cycle 10: 8 - 2 - 7 - 9 - 8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 2 has a chord: (1, 8) => <2, (1, 8), 4>
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (3, 8) => <3, (3, 8), 4>
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (3, 7) => <4, (3, 7), 4>
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (1, 7) => <6, (1, 7), 5>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (1, 3) => <7, (1, 3), 4>
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (2, 8) => <8, (2, 8), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<2, (1, 8), 4>
<3, (3, 8), 4>
<4, (3, 7), 4>
<6, (1, 7), 5>
<7, (1, 3), 4>
<8, (2, 8), 5>
