Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 3, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 0, 4, 7, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 7, 6, 2, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 2, 4, 9)
- Cycle 6: (6, 7, 4, 0, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 9, 8, 7, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 2, 4, 7, 6)
- Cycle 9: (4, 7, 3, 8, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 7, 3, 5, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 0, 1, 9, 4)
- Cycle 12: (7, 3, 8, 9, 7)
- Cycle 13: (8, 7, 4, 0, 8)
- Cycle 14: (1, 0, 5, 8, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <1, (8, 3), 9, 7>
2. <2, (9, 0), 7, 4>
3. <3, (4, 7), 8, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordless cycles found is [11].
