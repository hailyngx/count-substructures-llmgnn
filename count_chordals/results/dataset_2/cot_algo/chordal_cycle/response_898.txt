This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 14) (15, 17) (5, 17) (5, 10) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 16) (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 0) (12, 3) (12, 7) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 4) (14, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (8, 15) (8, 9) (8, 17) (18, 16) (18, 1) (19, 4) (19, 1) (19, 13) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 19) (1, 6) (6, 1) (6, 13) (6, 16) (16, 3) (16, 9) (16, 18) (16, 6) (17, 15) (17, 5) (17, 8) (13, 7) (13, 19) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:

- (15, 14, 3, 12, 15)
- (15, 17, 5, 10, 15)
- (15, 17, 8, 9, 15)
- (5, 17, 15, 8, 5)
- (5, 17, 8, 9, 5)
- (9, 8, 15, 17, 9)
- (9, 8, 17, 5, 9)
- (9, 16, 18, 1, 9)
- (4, 7, 12, 3, 4)
- (4, 7, 11, 0, 4)
- (4, 14, 15, 3, 4)
- (7, 12, 3, 15, 7)
- (7, 12, 7, 11, 7)

- (11, 0, 4, 14, 11)
- (11, 0, 14, 3, 11)
- (11, 7, 12, 3, 11)
- (12, 3, 15, 17, 12)
- (0, 4, 14, 3, 0)
- (0, 4, 14, 15, 0)
- (0, 11, 7, 13, 0)
- (14, 15, 3, 12, 14)
- (14, 15, 17, 5, 14)
- (14, 4, 7, 12, 14)
- (2, 9, 8, 15, 2)
- (2, 9, 8, 17, 2)
- (2, 1, 18, 16, 2)
- (8, 15, 17, 5, 8)
- (8, 9, 16, 18, 8)
- (8, 9, 3, 12, 8)
- (8, 17, 5, 10, 8)
- (18, 16, 6, 1, 18)
- (19, 4, 7, 11, 19)
- (19, 4, 14, 0, 19)
- (19, 1, 2, 9, 19)
- (1, 18, 16, 6, 1)
- (1, 18, 16, 3, 1)
- (1, 19, 4, 7, 1)
- (1, 6, 13, 19, 1)
- (6, 1, 2, 9, 6)
- (6, 16, 3, 12, 6)
- (6, 13, 7, 12, 6)
- (16, 3, 15, 14, 16)
- (17, 15, 14, 4, 17)
- (17, 5, 10, 15, 17)
- (17, 8, 15, 14, 17)
- (13, 7, 4, 14, 13)
- (13, 19, 1, 18, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <3, (15, 17), 5, 10>
- <4, (14, 15), 3, 12>
- <15, (17, 5), 8, 9>
- <7, (12, 3), 15, 17>
- <9, (16, 18), 1, 19>
- <16, (3, 15), 14, 4>
- <18, (16, 6), 1, 2>
- <19, (1, 2), 9, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are [8] chordless cycles in the graph.
