Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 9) (17, 9) (17, 15) (2, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (7, 9) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 19) (12, 8) (12, 16) (12, 5) (12, 15) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 5) (0, 6) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 14) (15, 13) (15, 17) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 19) (19, 16) (19, 15) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 18) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 5) (9, 13) (9, 17) (9, 7) (4, 10) (4, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 10 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 1 - 10 - 11 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 6 - 14 - 11 - 10 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 6 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 5: 7 - 11 - 10 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 6: 7 - 11 - 10 - 1 - 0 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 7: 7 - 9 - 13 - 8 - 12 - 5 - 14 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 8: 7 - 9 - 13 - 8 - 12 - 15 - 19 - 16 - 18 - 5 - 14 - 11 - 7
- Cycle 9: 7 - 9 - 13 - 15 - 19 - 16 - 18 - 5 - 14 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 10: 12 - 8 - 13 - 15 - 12
- Cycle 11: 12 - 8 - 13 - 9 - 7 - 11 - 14 - 5 - 12
- Cycle 12: 12 - 8 - 18 - 16 - 19 - 15 - 12
- Cycle 13: 13 - 8 - 18 - 5 - 14 - 11 - 10 - 4 - 13
- Cycle 14: 13 - 9 - 7 - 11 - 14 - 5 - 12 - 15 - 13
- Cycle 15: 13 - 9 - 7 - 15 - 19 - 16 - 18 - 5 - 14 - 6 - 13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: has a chord: 1 - 4 (0 - 10) --> This is a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 2: has a chord: 1 - 7 (0 - 10) --> This is a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 3: has a chord: 6 - 11 (0 - 14) --> This is a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 4: Not a 4-cycle
- Cycle 5: has a chord: 7 - 4 (10 - 11) --> This is a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 6: has a chord: 1 - 6 (0 - 10) --> This is a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 7: has a chord: 9 - 13 (7 - 8) --> This is a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 8: has a chord: 15 - 16 (7 - 18) --> This is a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 9: has a chord: 13 - 15 (9 - 19) --> This is a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 10: has a chord: 8 - 15 (12 - 13) --> This is a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 11: has a chord: 13 - 14 (8 - 9) --> This is a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 12: has a chord: 8 - 15 (12 - 13) --> This is a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 13: has a chord: 8 - 5 (13 - 14) --> This is a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 14: has a chord: 7 - 15 (9 - 11) --> This is a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 15: has a chord: 9 - 16 (13 - 19) --> This is a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final answer is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 4, 10, 1>
- <0, 7, 11, 10>
- <6, 14, 11, 10>
- <0, 10, 1, 6>
- <7, 9, 13, 8>
- <7, 15, 16, 18>
- <9, 13, 15, 19>
- <8, 12, 15, 13>
- <8, 13, 5, 14>
- <7, 11, 15, 9>
