Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 13) (15, 3) (15, 16) (6, 14) (9, 18) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 18) (0, 16) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 7) (7, 16) (7, 13) (7, 17) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 19) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 19) (19, 12) (19, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 11) (10, 3) (10, 5) (10, 18) (17, 7) (17, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3-15-16-1-3
- Cycle 2: 8-2-12-5-8
- Cycle 3: 11-1-18-10-11
- Cycle 4: 14-8-11-4-14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Chord (3, 1)
- Cycle 2: Chord (2, 5)
- Cycle 3: Chord (1, 10)
- Cycle 4: Chord (8, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <3, (1, 15), 16>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles in the given graph is [0].
