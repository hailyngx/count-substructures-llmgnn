Step 2: 
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <Cycle 2, (0, 5)>
- <Cycle 4, (3, 6)>
- <Cycle 11, (0, 1)>
- <Cycle 13, (5, 7)>
- <Cycle 16, (6, 8)>
- <Cycle 19, (1, 4)>
- <Cycle 21, (5, 6)>
- <Cycle 22, (4, 6)>
- <Cycle 25, (0, 4)>
- <Cycle 26, (6, 9)>
- <Cycle 29, (1, 7)>
- <Cycle 30, (4, 9)>
- <Cycle 31, (1, 8)>
- <Cycle 34, (2, 9)>

Step 3: 
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [14]
