Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 4, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 8, 1, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 1, 4, 6, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 1, 8, 5, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 4, 6, 3, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 4, 8, 1, 9)
- Cycle 8: (4, 6, 3, 7, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 6, 8, 1, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 8, 5, 9, 4)
- Cycle 11: (7, 3, 6, 4, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 3, 2, 0, 7)
- Cycle 13: (7, 3, 6, 8, 7)
- Cycle 14: (1, 8, 6, 4, 1)
- Cycle 15: (1, 8, 5, 9, 1)
- Cycle 16: (6, 8, 5, 0, 6)
- Cycle 17: (6, 8, 1, 9, 6)
- Cycle 18: (6, 4, 9, 5, 6)
- Cycle 19: (8, 5, 0, 7, 8)
- Cycle 20: (8, 5, 9, 1, 8)
- Cycle 21: (8, 5, 0, 2, 8)
- Cycle 22: (0, 5, 9, 1, 0)
- Cycle 23: (0, 5, 8, 6, 0)
- Cycle 24: (0, 8, 1, 9, 0)
- Cycle 25: (0, 8, 6, 4, 0)
- Cycle 26: (2, 0, 8, 6, 2)
- Cycle 27: (2, 0, 7, 3, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (6, 4), 9>
- <4, (1, 8), 9>
- <5, (9, 1), 8>
- <8, (5, 0), 6>
- <0, (5, 9), 1>
- <2, (7, 3), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Final count: [6]
