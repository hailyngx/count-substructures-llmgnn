Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 18) (17, 12) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (12, 10) (12, 17) (12, 7) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 7) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 1) (14, 0) (14, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (13, 16) (13, 11) (13, 9) (9, 13) (9, 16) (9, 3) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (16, 15) (1, 0) (6, 14) (6, 15) (6, 11) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 15) (18, 3) (19, 18) (19, 4) (19, 3) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 19) (4, 2) (4, 19) (4, 15) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 18) (15, 4) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (7, 0, 1, 7)
        - Cycle 2: (7, 3, 9, 7)
        - Cycle 3: (2, 5, 15, 6, 2)
        - Cycle 4: (2, 11, 13, 9, 3, 2)
        - Cycle 5: (4, 2, 11, 6, 4)
        - Cycle 6: (8, 7, 3, 9, 8)
        - Cycle 7: (10, 12, 7, 3, 10)
        - Cycle 8: (12, 17, 10, 8, 12)
        - Cycle 9: (14, 6, 15, 5, 14)
        - Cycle 10: (14, 0, 1, 7, 14)
        - Cycle 11: (16, 13, 11, 6, 15, 16)
        - Cycle 12: (16, 0, 1, 7, 3, 16)
        - Cycle 13: (18, 15, 6, 11, 2, 18)
        - Cycle 14: (18, 10, 8, 7, 12, 18)
        - Cycle 15: (19, 18, 10, 12, 17, 19)
        - Cycle 16: (19, 4, 2, 11, 13, 19)
 
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <7, (3, 9), 7> with chord (3, 9)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <11, (6, 13), 2> with chord (6, 13)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <7, (1, 14), 0> with chord (1, 14)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <10, (8, 17), 12> with chord (8, 17)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <14, (5, 15), 6> with chord (5, 15)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - Number of chordal 4-cycles: [5]
