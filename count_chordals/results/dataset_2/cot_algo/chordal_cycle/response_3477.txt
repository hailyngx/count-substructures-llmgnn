Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 15) (5, 14) (9, 19) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 12) (4, 5) (4, 18) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 7) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 7) (17, 6) (17, 0) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 19) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 11) (6, 4) (6, 17) (6, 0) (19, 9) (19, 3) (19, 2) (19, 11) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 8) (16, 15) (7, 18) (7, 13) (15, 5) (15, 16) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 0) (10, 1) (0, 2) (0, 17) (0, 6) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (1, 3, 16, 1)
- (1, 3, 12, 1)
- (1, 16, 8, 2)
- (1, 16, 15, 5)
- (3, 12, 13, 2)
- (4, 18, 7, 13)
- (5, 14, 11, 19)
- (9, 12, 13, 7)
- (0, 17, 6, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 3, 16, 1> (chord: (3, 16))
- <1, 3, 12, 1> (chord: (3, 12))
- <1, 16, 8, 2> (chord: (16, 8))
- <1, 16, 15, 5> (chord: (16, 15))
- <3, 12, 13, 2> (chord: (12, 13))
- <4, 18, 7, 13> (chord: (18, 7))
- <5, 14, 11, 19> (chord: (14, 11))
- <9, 12, 13, 7> (chord: (12, 13))
- <0, 17, 6, 4> (chord: (17, 6))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
