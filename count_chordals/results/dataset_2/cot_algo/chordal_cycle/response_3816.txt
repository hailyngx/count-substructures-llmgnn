Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 6-9-8-2-6
- Cycle 2: 6-9-8-4-6
- Cycle 3: 6-3-1-5-6
- Cycle 4: 6-3-1-4-6
- Cycle 5: 6-4-1-5-6
- Cycle 6: 6-4-1-3-6
- Cycle 7: 6-4-8-9-6
- Cycle 8: 6-4-8-3-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has the chord (1, 5).
- Cycle 6 has the chord (1, 3).
- Cycle 7 has the chord (4, 8).
- Cycle 8 has the chord (4, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <6, 9, 8, 2> with chord (9, 2)
- <6, 3, 1, 5> with chord (1, 5)
- <6, 3, 1, 4> with chord (1, 4)
- <6 (4, 8), 3, 8> with chord (4, 8)
