Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-2-4-6-0 (6 edges)
- Cycle 2: 0-1-2-4-9-0 (6 edges)
- Cycle 3: 0-1-2-6-5-0 (6 edges)
- Cycle 4: 0-1-9-8-5-0 (5 edges)
- Cycle 5: 0-2-4-7-5-0 (5 edges)
- Cycle 6: 0-2-6-5-0 (4 edges)
- Cycle 7: 0-3-8-5-0 (4 edges)
- Cycle 8: 1-2-4-9-1 (4 edges)
- Cycle 9: 1-2-6-5-1 (4 edges)
- Cycle 10: 1-9-4-7-1 (4 edges)
- Cycle 11: 2-6-5-7-2 (4 edges)
- Cycle 12: 2-6-0-5-2 (4 edges)
- Cycle 13: 4-7-5-8-4 (4 edges)
- Cycle 14: 4-7-9-8-4 (4 edges)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, (1, 4), 2, 6, 0> (Chord: 1-4)
- <0, (1, 9), 2, 4, 9, 0> (Chord: 1-9)
- <0, 1, (2, 5), 6, 0> (Chord: 2-5)
- <0, 1, (5, 8), 4, 7, 0> (Chord: 5-8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [4].
