- Cycle 40: (15, 29, 27, 25)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (0, 20), 26, 9>
2. <26, (2, 8), 6, 7>
3. <3, (13, 25), 16, 25>
4. <20, (0, 9), 3, 21>
5. <27, (15, 29), 25, 3>
6. <22, (9, 17), 23, 3>
7. <23, (3, 17), 9, 22>
8. <12, (6, 7), 26, 8>
9. <19, (2, 18), 11, 4>
10. <18, (14, 19), 1, 28>

Step 3: Count the number of unique chordal 4-cycles:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
