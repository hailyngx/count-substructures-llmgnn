Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 25) (13, 4) (13, 11) (22, 13) (22, 18) (15, 27) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 24) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 23) (18, 22) (18, 9) (10, 7) (10, 23) (10, 14) (10, 29) (11, 13) (12, 15) (12, 25) (12, 0) (12, 9) (2, 26) (2, 16) (6, 17) (6, 7) (28, 8) (28, 9) (28, 19) (26, 2) (26, 3) (26, 0) (23, 27) (23, 10) (23, 19) (16, 2) (21, 20) (21, 4) (17, 6) (17, 0) (17, 19) (17, 5) (25, 13) (25, 12) (25, 5) (25, 4) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 20) (19, 28) (19, 23) (19, 17) (9, 18) (9, 12) (9, 28) (1, 29) (1, 5) (29, 27) (29, 10) (29, 1) (29, 8) (24, 15) (24, 20) (8, 15) (8, 28) (8, 14) (8, 29) (0, 12) (0, 26) (0, 17) (7, 10) (7, 6) (7, 14) (20, 21) (20, 14) (20, 24) (4, 13) (4, 21) (4, 25) (4, 5) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (3, 26) (3, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (13, 4, 25, 5)
- Cycle 2: (13, 4, 21, 20)
- Cycle 3: (13, 4, 5, 25)
- Cycle 4: (13, 11, 10, 7)
- Cycle 5: (22, 18, 9, 28)
- Cycle 6: (15, 8, 29, 1)
- Cycle 7: (15, 12, 9, 28)
- Cycle 8: (15, 24, 20, 21)
- Cycle 9: (27, 23, 19, 17)
- Cycle 10: (27, 29, 1, 5)
- Cycle 11: (18, 22, 13, 4)
- Cycle 12: (18, 9, 12, 15)
- Cycle 13: (10, 7, 6, 17)
- Cycle 14: (10, 23, 19, 28)
- Cycle 15: (10, 14, 20, 24)
- Cycle 16: (11, 13, 4, 25)
- Cycle 17: (12, 15, 8, 29)
- Cycle 18: (12, 9, 28, 19)
- Cycle 19: (12, 25, 5, 4)
- Cycle 20: (2, 26, 0, 17)
- Cycle 21: (6, 7, 10, 14)
- Cycle 22: (27, 23, 10, 14)
- Cycle 23: (27, 15, 12, 25)
- Cycle 24: (2, 26, 3, 5)

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <13, (4, 25), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <27, (23, 19), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <10, (7, 6), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, (26, 0), 17>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There were 24 cycles identified in Step 1, and 4 of them have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [20].
