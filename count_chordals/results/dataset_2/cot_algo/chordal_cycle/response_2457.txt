Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 0) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 3) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 14) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 14) (1, 2) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 2) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) 

Response:
The list of unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is as follows:
<0, 13, 3, 6>
<0, 13, 3, 12>
<0, 1, 2, 10>
<0, 1, 14, 9>
<4, 5, 6, 10>
<4, 5, 1, 14>
<4, 6, 3, 13>
<4, 6, 3, 12>
<4, 9, 14, 11>
<5, 1, 14, 9>
<8, 4, 9, 14>
<8, 4, 5, 6>
<8, 10, 2, 1>
<8, 10, 6, 4>
<9, 2, 10, 8>

By counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found, the final answer is [15].
