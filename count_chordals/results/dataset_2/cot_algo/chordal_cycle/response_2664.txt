Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (26, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (15, 0) (15, 8) (15, 12) (6, 9) (6, 24) (6, 14) (4, 7) (4, 18) (4, 25) (7, 4) (7, 16) (7, 5) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 24) (25, 4) (25, 20) (25, 21) (25, 18) (0, 15) (0, 27) (0, 28) (27, 0) (27, 22) (27, 24) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 11) (23, 5) (23, 14) (23, 29) (10, 17) (10, 21) (10, 14) (17, 10) (17, 1) (1, 26) (1, 20) (1, 17) (18, 4) (18, 25) (18, 21) (18, 29) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 19) (16, 7) (16, 28) (28, 0) (28, 16) (28, 19) (28, 13) (21, 25) (21, 10) (21, 18) (21, 24) (5, 7) (5, 23) (5, 12) (19, 11) (19, 28) (22, 27) (22, 29) (24, 6) (24, 20) (24, 27) (24, 21) (14, 9) (14, 6) (14, 23) (14, 10) (13, 9) (13, 28) (12, 15) (12, 5) (12, 29) (29, 23) (29, 18) (29, 22) (29, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 9 - 6 - 14 - 9
- Cycle 2: 9 - 8 - 15 - 12 - 9
- Cycle 3: 9 - 13 - 28 - 0 - 15 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 4: 9 - 14 - 23 - 29 - 12 - 15 - 0 - 27 - 24 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 5: 26 - 1 - 17 - 10 - 21 - 25 - 4 - 7 - 16 - 28 - 0 - 15 - 8 - 3 - 2 - 11 - 19 - 28 - 13 - 9 - 14 - 23 - 29 - 18 - 5 - 12 - 29

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the above cycles:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (6, 24)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (21, 29)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <9, 6, 24, 14>
- <26, 1, 17, 21, 29, 22, 27, 24>
