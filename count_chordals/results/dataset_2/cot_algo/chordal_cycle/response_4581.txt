Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 5-1-9-4-5
- Cycle 2: 5-4-3-8-5
- Cycle 3: 5-2-6-8-5
- Cycle 4: 1-9-0-8-1
- Cycle 5: 3-4-8-0-3
- Cycle 6: 8-6-2-7-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1: 5-1-9-4-5 (Chord: 1-9)
- Cycle 2: 5-4-3-8-5 (Chord: 4-8)
- Cycle 3: 5-2-6-8-5 (Chord: 2-6)
- Cycle 4: 1-9-0-8-1 (Chord: 1-8)
- Cycle 5: 3-4-8-0-3 (Chord: 3-8)
- Cycle 6: 8-6-2-7-8 (Chord: 6-2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycles found: <5, (1, 9)>, <5, (4, 8)>, <5, (2, 6)>, <1, (1, 8)>, <3, (3, 8)>, <6, (6, 2)>.
