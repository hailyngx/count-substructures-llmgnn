Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 14) (13, 3) (13, 8) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 11) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (4, 1) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 12) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 4) (14, 1) (14, 8) (14, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 3, 5)
2. Cycle 2: (5, 3, 8, 13, 3, 5)
3. Cycle 3: (9, 10, 11, 3, 1, 9)
4. Cycle 4: (9, 12, 2, 10, 9)
5. Cycle 5: (1, 14, 11, 3, 1)
6. Cycle 6: (1, 4, 2, 12, 1)
7. Cycle 7: (3, 11, 7, 10, 9, 3)
8. Cycle 8: (3, 13, 8, 14, 1, 3)
9. Cycle 9: (10, 6, 2, 12, 9, 10)
10. Cycle 10: (11, 0, 5, 9, 1, 11)
11. Cycle 11: (11, 4, 2, 6, 10, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

For Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 3, 5) - Chord (9, 3) -> <1, (9, 3), 5>
For Cycle 2: (5, 3, 8, 13, 3, 5) - Chord (3, 8) -> <2, (3, 8), 5>
For Cycle 3: (9, 10, 11, 3, 1, 9) - Chord (10, 3) -> <3, (10, 3), 9>
Cycle 4: (9, 12, 2, 10, 9) does not have a chord.
Cycle 5: (1, 14, 11, 3, 1) does not have a chord.
Cycle 6: (1, 4, 2, 12, 1) does not have a chord.
For Cycle 7: (3, 11, 7, 10, 9, 3) - Chord (11, 10) -> <4, (11, 10), 3>
Cycle 8: (3, 13, 8, 14, 1, 3) does not have a chord.
Cycle 9: (10, 6, 2, 12, 9, 10) does not have a chord.
Cycle 10: (11, 0, 5, 9, 1, 11) does not have a chord.
Cycle 11: (11, 4, 2, 6, 10, 11) does not have a chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 6 chordless 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [6].
