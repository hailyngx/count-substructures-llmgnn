Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 2) (16, 0) (16, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 19) (1, 12) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 18) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 16) (0, 17) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 13) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 7) (18, 12) (19, 1) (19, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 13) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 15) (7, 6) (7, 18) (7, 13) (2, 11) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 5) (15, 4) (4, 16) (4, 15) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 18) (12, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (0, 16, 4, 15)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 16, 4, 15, 5, 1, 12, 18)
        - Cycle 3: (0, 16, 4, 15, 5, 18, 7, 6)
        - and more...

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        <0, 16, (2, 11), 4, 15> (Chord: (2, 11))
        <0, 16, 4, 15, (1, 19), 12, 18> (Chord: (1, 19))
        <0, 16, (6, 9), 4, 15> (Chord: (6, 9))
        - and more...

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <0, 16, (2, 11), 4, 15>
        <0, 16, 4, 15, (1, 19), 12, 18>
        <0, 16, (6, 9), 4, 15>
        - and more...
