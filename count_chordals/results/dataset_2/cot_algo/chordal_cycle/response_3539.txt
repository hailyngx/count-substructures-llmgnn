Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 10) (5, 7) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 5) (13, 1) (8, 14) (8, 9) (8, 10) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 10) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (2, 7) (2, 14) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 5, 13, 12, 9, 14, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 5, 13, 1, 12, 9, 14, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 1, 12, 9, 14, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 1, 13, 12, 9, 14, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 7, 1, 13, 5, 7)
- Cycle 6: (4, 7, 1, 11, 9, 14, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 7, 1, 11, 6, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 7, 2, 14, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 7, 2, 10, 6, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 7, 2, 10, 14, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 7, 2, 10, 9, 14, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 7, 2, 11, 1, 13, 12, 9, 14, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 6, 10, 2, 11, 1, 13, 5, 7, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 6, 11, 1, 13, 5, 7, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 6, 11, 9, 14, 4)
- Cycle 16: (4, 6, 10, 14, 9, 12, 13, 5, 7, 4)


Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <2, (4, 12), 9, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (4, 5), 13, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (4, 9), 14, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, (4, 6), 10, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <10, (4, 12), 13, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <2, (4, 7), 1, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6, (4, 10), 2, 14>


Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 16 cycles found, out of which 7 are chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [9].
