Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 1-2-5-6-1
        - Cycle 2: 1-2-7-4-1
        - Cycle 3: 1-8-2-7-1
        - Cycle 4: 1-9-3-0-1
        - Cycle 5: 2-5-6-7-2
        - Cycle 6: 2-8-1-6-2
        - Cycle 7: 2-9-1-8-2
        - Cycle 8: 3-0-4-6-3
        - Cycle 9: 3-1-6-5-3
        - Cycle 10: 3-9-8-1-3
        - Cycle 11: 4-6-7-2-4
        - Cycle 12: 4-7-8-1-4
        - Cycle 13: 4-0-3-9-4
        - Cycle 14: 5-2-1-8-5
        - Cycle 15: 5-6-4-0-5
        - Cycle 16: 6-5-2-9-6
        - Cycle 17: 7-2-1-9-7
        - Cycle 18: 7-6-1-8-7
        - Cycle 19: 8-1-9-3-8
        - Cycle 20: 9-1-6-4-9
        - Cycle 21: 9-3-0-7-9
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, 2, 5, 6> has 1 chord: (1, 6)
        - <1, 2, 7, 4> has 1 chord: (2, 7)
        - <1, 8, 2, 7> has 1 chord: (8, 7)
        - <1, 9, 3, 0> has 1 chord: (3, 9)
        - <2, 5, 6, 7> has 1 chord: (5, 7)
        - <2, 8, 1, 6> has 1 chord: (1, 6)
        - <2, 9, 1, 8> has 1 chord: (1, 8)
        - <3, 0, 4, 6> has 1 chord: (0, 6)
        - <3, 1, 6, 5> has 1 chord: (1, 5)
        - <3, 9, 8, 1> has 1 chord: (8, 1)
        - <4, 6, 7, 2> has 1 chord: (6, 7)
        - <4, 7, 8, 1> has 1 chord: (7, 8)
        - <4, 0, 3, 9> has 1 chord: (0, 3)
        - <5, 2, 1, 8> has 1 chord: (2, 8)
        - <5, 6, 4, 0> has 1 chord: (5, 4)
        - <6, 5, 2, 9> has 1 chord: (5, 9)
        - <7, 2, 1, 9> has 1 chord: (2, 9)
        - <7, 6, 1, 8> has 1 chord: (6, 8)
        - <8, 1, 9, 3> has 1 chord: (1, 3)
        - <9, 1, 6, 4> has 1 chord: (1, 4)
        - <9, 3, 0, 7> has 1 chord: (3, 7)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 21 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [21].
