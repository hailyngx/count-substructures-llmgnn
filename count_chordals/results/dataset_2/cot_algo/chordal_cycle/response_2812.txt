Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 28) (3, 0) (3, 20) (3, 26) (15, 20) (15, 0) (15, 23) (15, 18) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 21) (18, 15) (18, 2) (18, 27) (18, 21) (1, 26) (1, 29) (1, 14) (1, 7) (26, 3) (26, 1) (26, 28) (26, 10) (26, 0) (20, 3) (20, 15) (20, 23) (5, 2) (5, 13) (5, 23) (5, 16) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 17) (13, 4) (13, 19) (28, 3) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 25) (16, 5) (16, 28) (16, 4) (16, 19) (4, 13) (4, 16) (4, 10) (27, 18) (11, 24) (11, 25) (11, 29) (23, 15) (23, 20) (23, 5) (23, 21) (17, 13) (8, 19) (19, 13) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 14) (6, 24) (6, 22) (6, 0) (24, 11) (24, 6) (24, 0) (24, 22) (10, 26) (10, 4) (29, 1) (29, 11) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 26) (0, 6) (0, 24) (14, 1) (14, 19) (14, 25) (22, 6) (22, 24) (7, 1) (7, 5) (25, 28) (25, 11) (25, 14) (21, 2) (21, 18) (21, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (3, 26, 1, 7, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 26, 28, 16, 5, 23, 20, 15, 18, 2, 5, 13, 4, 10, 26)
- Cycle 3: (3, 26, 28, 25, 11, 29, 1, 14, 19, 13, 5, 15, 20, 23, 21, 18)
- Cycle 4: (3, 26, 28, 16, 19, 14, 25, 11, 24, 6, 0, 15, 20, 23, 5, 7)
- Cycle 5: (3, 26, 0, 24, 22, 6, 21, 18, 15, 20, 23, 5, 2, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <3, (1, 7), 26>
- <5, (23, 20), 15>
- <3, (28, 16), 26>
- <29, (14, 19), 1>
- <20, (15, 23), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 5 chordless 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
