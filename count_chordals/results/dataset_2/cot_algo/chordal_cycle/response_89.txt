Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 12) (15, 11) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 11) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 16) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 12) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 17) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 14) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 17) (17, 2) (17, 1) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 18) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 12) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 12) (16, 7) (16, 19) (16, 0) (18, 10) (18, 19) (18, 14) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 18) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 19) (12, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 8-4-1-7-8
- Cycle 2: 2-6-14-5-2
- Cycle 3: 16-7-1-17-16
- Cycle 4: 19-5-13-0-19
- Cycle 5: 18-10-13-0-18

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 7) -> Chordless cycle found: <1, 4, 8, 7>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (6, 14) -> Chordless cycle found: <6, 2, 5, 14>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 17) -> Chordless cycle found: <7, 1, 17, 16>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (13, 0) -> Chordless cycle found: <5, 19, 0, 13>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (13, 0) -> Chordless cycle found: <10, 13, 0, 18>

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles found: [5]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, 4, 8, 7>
<6, 2, 5, 14>
<7, 1, 17, 16>
<5, 19, 0, 13>
<10, 13, 0, 18>
