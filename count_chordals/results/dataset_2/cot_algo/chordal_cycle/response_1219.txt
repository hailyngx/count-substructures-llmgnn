Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 12) (14, 4) (17, 2) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 18) (2, 17) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 8) (18, 2) (18, 9) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 7) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 5) (1, 19) (1, 12) (19, 5) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 16) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 16) (16, 9) (16, 12) (16, 6) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 19) (11, 0) (6, 16) (6, 7) (7, 15) (7, 5) (7, 6) (0, 19) (0, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 12, 3)
- Cycle 2: (4, 14, 2, 4)
- Cycle 3: (8, 11, 19, 1, 12, 8)
- Cycle 4: (2, 18, 9, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 18, 8, 11, 19, 2)
- Cycle 6: (5, 13, 2, 4, 11, 5)
- Cycle 7: (12, 16, 9, 18, 2, 13, 5, 12)
- Cycle 8: (15, 3, 10, 8, 11, 4, 2, 13, 12, 15)
- Cycle 9: (7, 15, 12, 1, 19, 11, 0, 7)
- Cycle 10: (9, 8, 18, 2, 13, 5, 7, 6, 16, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (15, 3), 12, (3, 15)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <14, (4, 2), 11, (2, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <8, (11, 19), 1, (19, 12)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (18, 2), 13, (2, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <11, (8, 19), 0, (19, 11)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, (13, 2), 4, (2, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <16, (9, 18), 2, (18, 16)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <7, (15, 12), 1, (12, 7)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [8].
