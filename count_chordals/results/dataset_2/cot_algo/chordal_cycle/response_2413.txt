Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (6, 1, 0, 4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 1, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 3, 4, 0, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 3, 7, 2, 6)
- Cycle 5: (9, 7, 3, 4, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 7, 1, 0, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 8, 2, 5, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 8, 2, 7, 9)
  
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord, (1, 4): <1, (1, 4), 6)>
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord, (1, 6): <2, (1, 6), 5)>
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord, (0, 4): <3, (0, 4), 6)>
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord, (2, 6): <4, (2, 6), 3)>
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord, (7, 9): <5, (7, 9), 3)>
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord, (0, 9): <6, (0, 9), 7)>
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord, (5, 9): <7, (5, 9), 8)>
- Cycle 8 has no chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1]. 
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (1, 4), 6)>.
