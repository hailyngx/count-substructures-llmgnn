Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
    
    - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 5)
    - Cycle 2: (5, 1, 3, 5)
    - Cycle 3: (5, 1, 9, 5)
    - Cycle 4: (5, 1, 3, 2, 5)
    - Cycle 5: (9, 1, 3, 9)
    - Cycle 6: (9, 5, 1, 9)
    - Cycle 7: (9, 5, 1, 3, 9)
    - Cycle 8: (4, 6, 7, 4)
    - Cycle 9: (4, 6, 8, 4)
    - Cycle 10: (4, 6, 8, 7, 4)
    - Cycle 11: (4, 6, 7, 2, 4)
    - Cycle 12: (7, 8, 6, 7)
    - Cycle 13: (7, 8, 4, 7)
    - Cycle 14: (7, 8, 6, 4, 7)
    - Cycle 15: (7, 8, 4, 2, 7)
    - Cycle 16: (1, 3, 2, 1)
    
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

    - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (5, 9), 3, (1, 5)>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (5, 1), 3, (2, 5)>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (6, 8), 7, (4, 7)>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (6, 7), 8, (4, 8)>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, (6, 8), 7, (2, 4)>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <7, (8, 4), 6, (7, 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

    There are 16 cycles listed.
    
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [6].
