- <(6, 13, 29, 21), (6, 23)>
- <(7, 20, 17, 25), (7, 24)>
- <(9, 22, 0, 25), (9, 26)>
- <(10, 12, 5, 9), (10, 15)>
- <(11, 25, 17, 4), (11, 29)>
- <(14, 0, 25, 17), (14, 8)>
- <(16, 18, 21, 20), (16, 10)>
- <(19, 14, 0, 25), (19, 28)>
- <(23, 26, 9, 22), (23, 6)>
- <(27, 2, 11, 25), (27, 3)>

Step 3:
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph. Therefore, the final count is [12].
