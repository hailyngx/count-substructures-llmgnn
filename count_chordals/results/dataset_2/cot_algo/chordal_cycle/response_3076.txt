Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. (5, 9, 1, 4)
2. (5, 9, 6, 2)
3. (6, 9, 1, 4)
4. (6, 9, 8, 2)
5. (9, 6, 7, 2)
6. (9, 8, 2, 6)
7. (1, 9, 6, 4)
8. (3, 5, 9, 1)
9. (3, 5, 9, 6)
10. (3, 7, 6, 2)
11. (3, 4, 1, 9)
12. (4, 1, 9, 5)
13. (4, 1, 9, 6)
14. (4, 3, 5, 7)
15. (4, 3, 7, 6)
16. (4, 6, 7, 2)
17. (8, 9, 5, 0)
18. (8, 9, 6, 7)
19. (8, 9, 1, 4)
20. (8, 2, 6, 7)
21. (2, 6, 7, 3)
22. (2, 6, 4, 1)
23. (2, 8, 9, 5)
24. (2, 8, 9, 6)
25. (0, 5, 9, 1)
26. (0, 5, 9, 6)
27. (0, 5, 3, 7)
28. (0, 9, 6, 7)
29. (0, 9, 1, 4)
30. (0, 9, 4, 8)
31. (0, 9, 8, 2)
32. (0, 6, 7, 2)
33. (7, 6, 9, 5)
34. (7, 6, 9, 1)
35. (7, 6, 2, 8)
36. (7, 3, 5, 9)
37. (7, 3, 4, 1)
38. (7, 2, 6, 9)

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle is: <5, (1, 4), 9)
This cycle has exactly one chord (1, 4) connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
