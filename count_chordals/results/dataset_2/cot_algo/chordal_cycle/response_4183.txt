Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-1-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-9-1-4-0
- Cycle 3: 0-9-4-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-9-4-6-0
- Cycle 5: 0-5-2-4-0
- Cycle 6: 0-5-2-8-0
- Cycle 7: 0-5-1-9-0
- Cycle 8: 0-5-1-4-0
- Cycle 9: 6-4-2-5-6
- Cycle 10: 6-4-2-8-6
- Cycle 11: 6-4-9-7-6
- Cycle 12: 4-9-7-3-4
- Cycle 13: 4-9-7-1-4
- Cycle 14: 4-9-1-5-4
- Cycle 15: 4-9-1-8-4
- Cycle 16: 5-1-9-7-5
- Cycle 17: 5-1-4-9-5
- Cycle 18: 5-1-8-2-5
- Cycle 19: 5-2-8-3-5
- Cycle 20: 2-8-3-7-2
- Cycle 21: 2-8-3-1-2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, 1, 8, 9> with chord (0, 8)
- <0, 1, 4, 5> with chord (1, 5)
- <0, 2, 4, 5> with chord (2, 4)
- <0, 4, 6, 9> with chord (4, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are a total of [4] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
