Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 13) (3, 9) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 8) (6, 15) (6, 19) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 16) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 18) (10, 0) (10, 18) (10, 19) (11, 3) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 18) (0, 1) (19, 15) (19, 6) (19, 10) (17, 3) (17, 0) (8, 15) (8, 16) (8, 18) (16, 9) (16, 8) (14, 5) (14, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 14) (18, 7) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 8) (18, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Possible cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- (3, 11, 3, 17)
- (3, 11, 3, 13)
- (3, 11, 3, 9)
- (3, 17, 0, 12)
- (3, 13, 4, 1)
- (3, 9, 16, 8)
- (15, 19, 6, 4)
- (15, 19, 6, 15)
- (15, 19, 10, 18)
- (15, 6, 4, 1)
- (15, 6, 4, 13)
- (15, 8, 16, 9)
- (6, 4, 7, 18)
- (6, 4, 13, 18)
- (6, 19, 10, 0)
- (9, 3, 11, 3)
- (9, 16, 8, 15)
- (4, 1, 12, 0)
- (4, 1, 0, 10)
- (4, 13, 18, 7)
- (7, 18, 10, 0)
- (10, 0, 12, 5)
- (10, 18, 13, 3)
- (11, 3, 9, 16)
- (5, 12, 0, 10)
- (5, 14, 1, 0)
- (2, 12, 0, 10)
- (12, 0, 10, 18)
- (12, 0, 17, 3)
- (12, 0, 1, 4)
- (0, 10, 19, 6)
- (0, 17, 3, 11)
- (0, 1, 4, 13)
- (19, 6, 4, 1)
- (19, 10, 0, 12)
- (17, 3, 9, 16)
- (8, 15, 19, 6)
- (8, 16, 9, 3)
- (16, 9, 3, 13)
- (14, 5, 12, 2)
- (1, 4, 6, 15)
- (1, 4, 7, 18)
- (1, 5, 12, 0)
- (1, 12, 5, 14)
- (18, 7, 4, 1)
- (18, 13, 3, 11)

Step 2:
From the above list, we find one unique chordal 4-cycle with a single chord:
- <3, (11, 17), 3, 9>

Step 3:
Thus, the number of chordless cycles found is: [0]
