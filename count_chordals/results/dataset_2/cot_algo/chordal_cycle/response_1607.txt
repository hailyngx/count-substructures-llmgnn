Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (0, 14) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 14) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 12) (13, 11) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 10) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 1) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 1, 9, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 14, 0, 13, 2, 8, 14, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 1, 6, 12, 0, 13, 9)
- Cycle 4: (4, 14, 0, 2, 13, 12, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 4, 3, 8, 14, 7)
- Cycle 6: (6, 1, 10, 3, 4, 6)
- Cycle 7: (12, 6, 1, 11, 13, 12)
- Cycle 8: (0, 14, 8, 3, 10, 0)
- Cycle 9: (13, 0, 12, 6, 5, 13)
- Cycle 10: (2, 0, 14, 7, 1, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (4, 7), 9>
- <2, (13, 0), 14>
- <3, (12, 6), 9>
- <4, (2, 13), 0>
- <5, (3, 8), 14> (This actually contains two chords, so it doesn't qualify)
- <6, (10, 3), 1>
- <7, (1, 11), 6>
- <8, (8, 14), 0>
- <9, (5, 6), 13>
- <10, (7, 1), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 9 chordal 4-cycles.

Thus, the final answer is [9].
