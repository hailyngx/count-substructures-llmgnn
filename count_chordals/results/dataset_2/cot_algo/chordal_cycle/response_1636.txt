Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <6, 9, 7, 0, 6>
- <9, 2, 4, 9>
- <2, 8, 0, 2>
- <8, 3, 7, 0, 8>
- <0, 1, 6, 9, 0>
- <7, 3, 4, 9, 7>
- <1, 0, 2, 9, 1>
- <3, 4, 0, 8, 3>
- <4, 5, 8, 3, 4>
- <5, 7, 0, 8, 5>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <6, 9, 7, 0, 6> has 2 chords: (9, 7)
- <9, 2, 4, 9> has 1 chord: (2, 4)  (** Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, (2, 4), 9> **)
- <2, 8, 0, 2> has 1 chord: (8, 0)  (** Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, (8, 0), 2> **)
- <8, 3, 7, 0, 8> has 1 chord: (3, 7)  (** Chordal 4-cycle found: <8, (3, 7), 8> **)
- <0, 1, 6, 9, 0> has 1 chord: (1, 6)  (** Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, (1, 6), 0> **)
- <7, 3, 4, 9, 7> has 1 chord: (3, 4)  (** Chordal 4-cycle found: <7, (3, 4), 7> **)
- <1, 0, 2, 9, 1> has 1 chord: (0, 2)  (** Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (0, 2), 1> **)
- <3, 4, 0, 8, 3> has 1 chord: (4, 0)  (** Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, (4, 0), 3> **)
- <4, 5, 8, 3, 4> has 2 chords: (5, 8)
- <5, 7, 0, 8, 5> has 2 chords: (0, 8)

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles found = [6]
