Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 10) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 12) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 12) (11, 4) (14, 4) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 11) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 10) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1 - 8 - 7 - 9 - 13 - 11 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 8 - 7 - 3 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 11 - 13 - 9 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 11 - 13 - 10 - 12 - 11
- Cycle 5: 1 - 6 - 2 - 5 - 10 - 1
- Cycle 6: 2 - 0 - 4 - 14 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 7: 4 - 3 - 12 - 8 - 1 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Checking Cycle 1: 1 - 8 - 13 - 11 - 1 (Chord: (8, 13))
- Checking Cycle 2: 1 - 8 - 7 - 3 - 6 - 1 (Chord: (8, 3))
- Checking Cycle 3: 1 - 11 - 13 - 7 - 1 (Chord: (11, 7))
- Checking Cycle 4: 1 - 11 - 13 - 10 - 11 (Chord: (13, 10))
- Checking Cycle 5: 1 - 6 - 2 - 5 - 10 - 1 (Chord: (6, 5))
- Checking Cycle 6: 2 - 0 - 4 - 14 - 2 (Chord: (0, 4))
- Checking Cycle 7: 4 - 3 - 12 - 8 - 4 (Chord: (3, 12))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, which are: 
- <1, 8, 13, (8, 13)>
- <1, 8, 7, 3, (8, 3)>
- <1, 11, 13, 7, (11, 7)>
- <1, 11, 13, 10, (13, 10)>
- <1, 6, 2, 5, (6, 5)>
- <2, 0, 4, 14, (0, 4)>
- <4, 3, 12, 8, (3, 12)>

Therefore, the total number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
