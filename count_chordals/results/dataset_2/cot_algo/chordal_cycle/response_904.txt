Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 19) (4, 0) (7, 9) (12, 0) (12, 6) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 0) (3, 8) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 5) (11, 2) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 13) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 18) (15, 14) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 14) (18, 16) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 3) (0, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 17) (17, 3) (17, 2) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 6) (6, 12) (6, 8) (14, 15) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 16) (16, 18) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 13) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 9) (13, 19) (13, 16) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph. Let's list them:

1. Cycle 1: (4, 19, 5, 11, 3, 0, 4)
2. Cycle 2: (4, 0, 10, 18, 19, 4)
3. Cycle 3: (7, 9, 11, 3, 17, 2, 7)
4. Cycle 4: (12, 0, 3, 11, 5, 19, 12)
5. Cycle 5: (3, 0, 10, 18, 14, 1, 2, 3)
6. Cycle 6: (2, 17, 3, 8, 10, 0, 12, 6, 2)
7. Cycle 7: (6, 12, 0, 10, 8, 6)
8. Cycle 8: (14, 1, 2, 16, 18, 10, 0, 3, 17, 14)
9. Cycle 9: (16, 14, 1, 9, 11, 3, 0, 12, 6, 16)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 <1, (5, 19), 11, 0> - One chord (5, 19)
- Cycle 2: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 3: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 4: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 5: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 6 <2, (3, 8), 10, 12> - One chord (3, 8)
- Cycle 7: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 8: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 9 <9, (1, 14), 3, 16, 6> - One chord (1, 14)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have found 3 unique ones:
- <1, (5, 19), 11, 0>
- <2, (3, 8), 10, 12>
- <9, (1, 14), 3, 16, 6>

Therefore, the final count is [3].
