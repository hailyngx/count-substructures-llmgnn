Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 1-6-5-2-1
        - Cycle 2: 4-1-5-2-4
        - Cycle 3: 0-5-6-8-0
        - Cycle 4: 0-3-7-2-0
        - Cycle 5: 0-7-2-5-0
        - Cycle 6: 0-7-9-8-0
        - Cycle 7: 3-7-9-8-3
        - Cycle 8: 1-5-9-7-1
        - Cycle 9: 2-5-9-7-2
        - Cycle 10: 2-1-4-2
        - Cycle 11: 1-4-2-7-1
        - Cycle 12: 6-5-9-7-6
        - Cycle 13: 6-1-4-2-6
        - Cycle 14: 8-9-7-3-8
        - Cycle 15: 8-6-5-2-8
        - Cycle 16: 8-0-5-1-8
        - Cycle 17: 8-0-9-7-8
        - Cycle 18: 0-9-5-1-0
        - Cycle 19: 0-7-3-8-0
        - Cycle 20: 7-3-0-5-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <0, (3, 7), 8> (Cycle 19) - Chord: 3-7
        - <1, (2, 4), 5> (Cycle 10) - Chord: 2-4
        - <2, (1, 7), 5> (Cycle 11) - Chord: 1-7
        - <3, (8, 9), 7> (Cycle 14) - Chord: 8-9
        - <6, (4, 2), 5> (Cycle 13) - Chord: 4-2
        - <7, (9, 5), 0> (Cycle 18) - Chord: 9-5

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [15]

Final Answer: [15]
