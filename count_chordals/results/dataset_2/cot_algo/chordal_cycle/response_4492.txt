Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 11) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (18, 2) (18, 12) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 17) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 1) (10, 2) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 11) (15, 16) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 6) (1, 14) (6, 1) (6, 4) (19, 9) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 5) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 9) (16, 15) (16, 4) (16, 5) (17, 2) (17, 12) (17, 9) (17, 4) (3, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (5, 11) (5, 16) (5, 3) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 14) (9, 17) (4, 6) (4, 16) (4, 17) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 6, 4, 3, 5, 11, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 4, 3, 14, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 4, 16, 5, 11, 0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 4, 17, 2, 10, 15, 11, 0, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 6, 4, 17, 12, 18, 2, 10, 15, 11, 0, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 6, 4, 17, 12, 7, 13, 0, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 6, 4, 3, 5, 16, 15, 10, 2, 18, 12, 7, 13, 0, 1)
- Cycle 8: (2, 10, 15, 16, 5, 11, 0, 13, 7, 12, 18, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 17, 12, 7, 13, 0, 11, 15, 10, 2)
- Cycle 10: (3, 4, 6, 1, 14, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 4, 6, 1, 0, 11, 5, 16, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 6, 1, 0, 13, 7, 12, 18, 2, 10, 15, 16, 5, 11, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 4, 17, 2, 10, 15, 11, 0, 1) => Chord: (2, 10)
- Cycle 6: (1, 6, 4, 17, 12, 7, 13, 0, 1) => Chord: (12, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
- <1, 6, 4, 17, (2, 10), 15, 11> 
- <1, 6, 4, 17, 12, 7, 13, (12, 7), 0>
