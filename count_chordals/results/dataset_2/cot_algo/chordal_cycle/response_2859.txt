Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- <1, 4, 5, 2>
- <1, 4, 6, 0>
- <1, 4, 8, 9>
- <1, 4, 5, 7>
- <1, 5, 2, 9>
- <1, 5, 7, 9>
- <1, 6, 0, 8>
- <1, 8, 9, 7>
- <1, 8, 7, 2>
- <2, 5, 7, 9>
- <4, 5, 7, 6>
- <4, 5, 7, 9>
- <4, 6, 7, 5>
- <4, 8, 9, 7>
- <4, 8, 7, 5>

Step 2:
- <1, 4, 5, 7> has exactly one chord (1, 5)
- <1, 8, 7, 2> has exactly one chord (8, 2)
- <2, 5, 7, 9> has exactly one chord (5, 9)
- <4, 5, 7, 6> has exactly one chord (5, 7)
- <4, 5, 7, 9> has exactly one chord (5, 9)
- <4, 6, 7, 5> has exactly one chord (6, 7)
- <4, 8, 9, 7> has exactly one chord (8, 9)
- <4, 8, 7, 5> has exactly one chord (8, 7)

Step 3:
Out of the cycles with one chord, there are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles: 
- <1, 4, 5, 7>
- <1, 8, 7, 2>
- <2, 5, 7, 9>
- <4, 5, 7, 6>
- <4, 5, 7, 9>
- <4, 6, 7, 5>
- <4, 8, 9, 7>
- <4, 8, 7, 5>

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
