Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 17) (18, 13) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 18) (13, 2) (1, 11) (1, 17) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 0) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 0) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 17 - 16 - 11 - 1 - 17
- Cycle 2: 17 - 15 - 3 - 0 - 17
- Cycle 3: 17 - 15 - 2 - 7 - 17
- Cycle 4: 17 - 1 - 11 - 18 - 17
- Cycle 5: 17 - 18 - 13 - 9 - 17
- Cycle 6: 17 - 0 - 3 - 6 - 17
- Cycle 7: 17 - 15 - 19 - 18 - 17
- Cycle 8: 17 - 0 - 19 - 15 - 17
- Cycle 9: 12 - 5 - 14 - 8 - 12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1: <17, (16, 11), 1>
- Cycle 2: <17, (15, 3), 0>
- Cycle 3: <17, (15, 2), 7>
- Cycle 4: <17, (1, 18), 11>
- Cycle 5: <17, (18, 9), 13>
- Cycle 6: <17, (0, 3), 6>
- Cycle 7: <17, (19, 18), 15>
- Cycle 8: <17, (19, 0), 15>
- Cycle 9: <12, (5, 14), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found: [<17, (16, 11), 1>, <17, (15, 3), 0>, <17, (15, 2), 7>, <17, (1, 18), 11>, <17, (18, 9), 13>, <17, (0, 3), 6>, <17, (19, 18), 15>, <17, (19, 0), 15>, <12, (5, 14), 8>].
