The edges are as follows: (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 23) (22, 18) (22, 2) (22, 14) (3, 15) (3, 29) (15, 13) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 26) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 20) (7, 4) (7, 23) (7, 1) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 23) (18, 20) (0, 27) (0, 8) (27, 0) (27, 10) (27, 16) (10, 27) (10, 25) (10, 14) (11, 24) (11, 2) (6, 9) (6, 29) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 29) (9, 25) (9, 21) (9, 14) (2, 22) (2, 18) (2, 11) (2, 5) (28, 29) (28, 19) (29, 3) (29, 6) (29, 9) (29, 28) (29, 21) (20, 4) (20, 18) (5, 13) (5, 2) (26, 15) (1, 15) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 23) (23, 13) (23, 7) (23, 18) (23, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 24) (8, 25) (19, 28) (19, 21) (12, 6) (12, 17) (17, 12) (17, 25) (17, 16) (25, 10) (25, 9) (25, 8) (25, 17) (24, 11) (24, 8) (14, 22) (14, 10) (14, 9) (16, 27) (16, 17) (21, 9) (21, 29) (21, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle <0, 27, 10, 25>
- Cycle <0, 27, 16, 17>
- Cycle <1, 15, 3, 29>
- Cycle <1, 15, 26, 20>
- Cycle <1, 7, 23, 18>
- Cycle <2, 22, 18, 23>
- Cycle <2, 22, 14, 10>
- Cycle <2, 18, 23, 7>
- Cycle <4, 7, 23, 18>
- Cycle <6, 29, 9, 25>
- Cycle <6, 29, 21, 19>
- Cycle <6, 9, 25, 8>
- Cycle <8, 0, 27, 10>
- Cycle <8, 0, 27, 16>
- Cycle <8, 6, 29, 21>
- Cycle <9, 6, 8, 24>
- Cycle <9, 6, 29, 3>
- Cycle <9, 25, 10, 14>
- Cycle <10, 27, 0, 8>
- Cycle <10, 27, 16, 17>
- Cycle <11, 2, 22, 18>
- Cycle <12, 6, 29, 21>
- Cycle <14, 22, 18, 20>
- Cycle <15, 3, 29, 6>
- Cycle <16, 27, 0, 8>
- Cycle <17, 12, 6, 29>
- Cycle <18, 22, 2, 11>
- Cycle <21, 9, 6, 29>
- Cycle <22, 18, 23, 7>
- Cycle <25, 10, 27, 0>
- Cycle <26, 15, 3, 29>
- Cycle <27, 0, 8, 24>
- Cycle <29, 3, 15, 1>

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord):
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, (13, 15), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, (2, 18), 23>
- Chordal 4-cycle <21, (6, 29), 19>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 31 chordless cycles, so the final number inside brackets is [31].
