Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 10) (21, 1) (21, 12) (21, 15) (21, 29) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 13) (5, 6) (5, 24) (22, 26) (22, 24) (22, 20) (22, 29) (22, 7) (26, 22) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 17) (7, 22) (7, 25) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 17) (25, 7) (25, 23) (10, 1) (15, 21) (15, 23) (15, 28) (11, 9) (11, 20) (23, 25) (23, 15) (23, 2) (23, 24) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 27) (14, 1) (14, 26) (14, 7) (24, 5) (24, 22) (24, 23) (24, 16) (17, 26) (17, 7) (17, 27) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 28) (0, 18) (0, 19) (3, 0) (3, 4) (16, 24) (16, 20) (28, 15) (28, 0) (28, 13) (2, 26) (2, 7) (2, 23) (12, 21) (12, 8) (20, 22) (20, 11) (20, 16) (4, 3) (4, 19) (4, 13) (19, 6) (19, 0) (19, 4) (29, 21) (29, 22) (13, 9) (13, 28) (13, 4) (18, 0) (27, 8) (27, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <1, 21, 15, 23>
- Cycle 2: <1, 21, 29, 22>
- Cycle 3: <1, 21, 12, 8>
- Cycle 4: <1, 21, 29, 22, 26>
- Cycle 5: <1, 21, 12, 8, 9>
- Cycle 6: <1, 21, 29, 22, 7>
- Cycle 7: <1, 21, 15, 23, 25>
- Cycle 8: <1, 14, 26, 17>
- Cycle 9: <1, 14, 26, 17, 27>
- Cycle 10: <1, 14, 26, 17, 7>
- Cycle 11: <1, 14, 7, 22>
- Cycle 12: <1, 14, 7, 22, 29>
- Cycle 13: <1, 14, 7, 22, 26>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, 21, 15, 23> (Chord: 21-23) -> Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 21, (15, 23)>
- <1, 21, 29, 22> (Chord: 21-22) -> Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 21, (29, 22)>
- <1, 21, 12, 8> (Chord: 12-8) -> Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 21, (12, 8)>
- <1, 14, 26, 17> (Chord: 14-17) -> Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 14, (26, 17)>
- <1, 14, 7, 22> (Chord: 14-7) -> Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 14, (7, 22)>
- <1, 14, 26, 17, 7> (Chord: 26-7) -> Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 14, (17, 7)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, 21, (15, 23)>
<1, 21, (29, 22)>
<1, 21, (12, 8)>
<1, 14, (26, 17)>
<1, 14, (7, 22)>
<1, 14, (17, 7)>
