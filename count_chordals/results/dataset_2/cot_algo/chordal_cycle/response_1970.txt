Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 5) (3, 14) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 13) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 11) (7, 1) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 10) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: {6, 9, 7, 6} (chordless)
- Cycle 2: {6, 7, 0, 6} (chordless)
- Cycle 3: {6, 4, 8, 6} (chordless)
- Cycle 4: {9, 7, 0, 9} (chordless)
- Cycle 5: {4, 8, 2, 4} (chordless)
- Cycle 6: {8, 2, 12, 8} (chordless)
- Cycle 7: {2, 5, 14, 2} (chordless)
- Cycle 8: {0, 11, 3, 0} (chordless)
- Cycle 9: {7, 1, 5, 7} (chordless)
- Cycle 10: {13, 12, 10, 13} (chordless)
- Cycle 11: {3, 14, 13, 3} (chordless)
- Cycle 12: {10, 4, 13, 10} (chordless)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 4: {9, 7, 0, 9} has exactly one chord (edges (9, 0))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 11.
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <9, (7, 0), 9>.
