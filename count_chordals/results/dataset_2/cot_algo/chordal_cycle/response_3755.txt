Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 2) (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 15) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 19) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 2) (2, 16) (2, 17) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 2) (8, 19) (8, 12) (8, 18) (4, 1) (4, 15) (18, 8) (18, 19) (18, 7) (0, 7) (0, 15) (7, 9) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 13) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 8) (19, 18) (19, 1) (1, 4) (1, 19) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 0) (13, 7) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 12) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 12) (10, 9) (10, 6) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- <0, 15, 4, 1>
- <0, 15, 5, 9>
- <0, 15, 5, 19>
- <1, 4, 15, 0>
- <1, 4, 15, 5>
- <2, 17, 3, 6>
- <2, 17, 3, 12>
- <2, 17, 14, 19>
- <2, 17, 14, 19>
- <2, 17, 14, 19>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the above cycles:
- <0, 15, 4, 1> does not have any chord.
- <0, 15, 5, 9> has a chord: (5, 9).
- <0, 15, 5, 19> has a chord: (5, 19).
- <1, 4, 15, 0> does not have any chord.
- <1, 4, 15, 5> has a chord: (4, 15).
- <2, 17, 3, 6> has a chord: (3, 17).
- <2, 17, 3, 12> does not have any chord.
- <2, 17, 14, 19> has a chord: (14, 17).
- <2, 17, 14, 19> has a chord: (2, 17).
- <2, 17, 14, 19> has a chord: (14, 19).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
Since there are 5 cycles with exactly one chord, the final count is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 15, 5, 9> with chord (5, 9)
<0, 15, 5, 19> with chord (5, 19)
<1, 4, 15, 5> with chord (4, 15)
<2, 17, 3, 6> with chord (3, 17)
<2, 17, 14, 19> with chords (2, 17), (14, 17), and (14, 19)
