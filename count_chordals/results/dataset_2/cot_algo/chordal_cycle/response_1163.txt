Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
1. (5, 9, 1, 3, 5)
2. (5, 4, 8, 5)
3. (8, 1, 3, 5, 8)
4. (8, 1, 9, 5, 8)
5. (8, 4, 2, 6, 8)
6. (8, 6, 7, 0, 8)
7. (8, 6, 2, 4, 8)
8. (8, 7, 6, 2, 8)
9. (0, 7, 6, 8, 0)
10. (0, 7, 2, 9, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the cycles listed above:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 3).
- Cycle 2 is chordal: <1, (4, 8), 5)>
- Cycle 3 is chordal: <3, (1, 5), 8)>
- Cycle 4 has a chord (1, 9).
- Cycle 5 has a chord (4, 6).
- Cycle 6 is chordal: <6, (7, 8), 0)>
- Cycle 7 has a chord (6, 2).
- Cycle 8 has a chord (6, 7).
- Cycle 9 is chordal: <6, (7, 8), 0)>
- Cycle 10 has a chord (2, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 6 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the number of chordless cycles is [4].
