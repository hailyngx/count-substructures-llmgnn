Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        
        - Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 11 - 6 - 5
        - Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 7 - 3 - 5
        - Cycle 3: 5 - 12 - 6 - 11 - 5
        - Cycle 4: 5 - 13 - 2 - 1 - 5
        - Cycle 5: 5 - 10 - 1 - 14 - 5
        - Cycle 6: 5 - 7 - 9 - 11 - 5
        - Cycle 7: 5 - 7 - 3 - 4 - 5
        - Cycle 8: 5 - 7 - 8 - 1 - 5
        - Cycle 9: 5 - 7 - 3 - 11 - 5
        - Cycle 10: 5 - 7 - 8 - 0 - 5
        - Cycle 11: 9 - 8 - 0 - 6 - 9
        - Cycle 12: 9 - 8 - 3 - 7 - 9
        - Cycle 13: 6 - 0 - 8 - 3 - 6
        - Cycle 14: 14 - 1 - 2 - 13 - 14
        - Cycle 15: 14 - 1 - 10 - 5 - 14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (9, 11), 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (9, 7), 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (12, 6), 11>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (13, 2), 1>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (10, 1), 14>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, (7, 9), 11>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, (7, 3), 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, (7, 8), 1>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <5, (7, 3), 11>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <5, (7, 8), 0>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 11: <9, (8, 0), 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 12: <9, (8, 3), 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 13: <6, (0, 8), 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 14: <14, (1, 2), 13>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 15: <14, (1, 10), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
