Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 4) (1, 22) (1, 12) (21, 13) (21, 29) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 11) (0, 13) (27, 12) (27, 19) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 28) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 19) (22, 1) (22, 23) (22, 6) (22, 24) (23, 22) (23, 12) (12, 1) (12, 27) (12, 17) (12, 23) (28, 14) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 3) (29, 21) (29, 28) (29, 16) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 15) (6, 14) (6, 22) (6, 5) (6, 8) (13, 21) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 11) (26, 3) (26, 7) (11, 0) (11, 28) (11, 13) (11, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (3, 0) (3, 28) (3, 26) (3, 7) (3, 18) (16, 17) (16, 29) (16, 10) (18, 3) (18, 19) (18, 20) (19, 27) (19, 17) (19, 18) (15, 0) (15, 5) (15, 24) (15, 4) (7, 26) (7, 3) (7, 10) (2, 13) (2, 10) (20, 18) (10, 16) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 4) (4, 1) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 15) (4, 10) (24, 22) (24, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - (1, 4, 14, 17, 1)
        - (1, 22, 23, 12, 1)
        - (1, 12, 17, 19, 1)
        - (1, 22, 6, 14, 4, 1)
        - (1, 22, 6, 5, 15, 0, 1)
        - (1, 22, 24, 15, 0, 1)
        - (21, 13, 0, 1, 22, 21)
        - (21, 13, 11, 0, 1, 22, 21)
        - (21, 13, 11, 4, 1, 22, 21)
        - (21, 13, 0, 15, 24, 22, 21)
        - (21, 29, 16, 17, 12, 23, 21)
        - (21, 29, 16, 10, 2, 13, 21)
        - (0, 3, 26, 7, 10, 16, 29, 21, 13, 0)
        - (0, 3, 26, 7, 10, 2, 13, 21, 29, 28, 11, 0)
        - (0, 3, 26, 7, 10, 2, 13, 0)
        - (0, 3, 28, 11, 13, 2, 10, 7, 26, 3, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        <1, (22, 6), 14>
        <21, (13, 0), 1>
        <21, (29, 16), 17>
        <0, (3, 26), 7>
        <0, (3, 28), 11>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        [5]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
        <1, (22, 6), 14>
        <21, (13, 0), 1>
        <21, (29, 16), 17>
        <0, (3, 26), 7>
        <0, (3, 28), 11>
