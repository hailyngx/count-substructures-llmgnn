- Cycle 2 with chord (0, 4)  
- Cycle 3 with chord (5, 10)  
- Cycle 4 with chord (7, 10)  
- Cycle 5 with chord (1, 6)  
- Cycle 6 with chord (0, 11)  
- Cycle 7 with chord (0, 11)  
- Cycle 8 with chord (13, 4)  
- Cycle 9 with chord (8, 11)  
- Cycle 10 with chord (7, 14)  
- Cycle 11 with chord (1, 7)  
- Cycle 12 with chord (0, 13)  
- Cycle 13 with chord (8, 5)  
- Cycle 14 with chord (3, 11)  
- Cycle 15 with chord (2, 13)  
- Cycle 16 with chord (2, 4)  
- Cycle 17 with chord (1, 7)  
- Cycle 18 with chord (2, 5)  
- Cycle 19 with chord (6, 14)
