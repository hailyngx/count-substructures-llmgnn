Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 14) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 12) (4, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 13) (14, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 14) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 8) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 4, 3, 1, 2, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 10, 7, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 9, 10, 14, 13, 8, 2, 6)
- Cycle 4: (9, 6, 2, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 2, 8, 13, 4, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 10, 7, 3, 1, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 10, 14, 13, 4, 3, 9)
- Cycle 8: (1, 3, 2, 8, 13, 12, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 3, 4, 12, 11, 7, 10, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 5, 14, 13, 8, 2, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 5, 8, 13, 12, 11, 7, 10, 1)
- Cycle 12: (3, 4, 12, 11, 7, 10, 14, 3)
- Cycle 13: (10, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 2, 8, 13, 12, 1> has one chord (2, 8)
- <1, 5, 14, 13, 8, 2, 1> has one chord (5, 14)
- <3, 4, 12, 11, 7, 10, 14, 3> has one chord (4, 11)
- <10, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 10> has one chord (7, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 9 chordless cycles found. 

Therefore, the final count is [9].
