Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 7) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (8, 19) (8, 5) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 10) (2, 19) (2, 9) (12, 16) (12, 0) (12, 18) (16, 17) (16, 12) (16, 18) (16, 9) (11, 4) (11, 17) (11, 19) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 3) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 18) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (9, 15) (0, 12) (15, 17) (15, 9) (15, 13) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 15) (10, 7) (10, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 4-13-3-14-4 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 2: 4-13-15-9-4 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 3: 4-13-3-5-4 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 4: 4-9-2-19-4 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 5: 4-9-16-12-4 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 6: 4-11-17-15-4 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 7: 7-14-6-18-7 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 8: 7-14-3-13-7 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 9: 7-14-18-12-7 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 10: 7-14-19-8-7 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 11: 7-14-19-10-7 (chordless cycle of length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <4, (13, 3), 14>
- Cycle 2: <4, (13, 15), 9>
- Cycle 3: <4, (13, 5), 4>
- Cycle 4: <4, (9, 16), 12>
- Cycle 5: <4, (9, 2), 19>
- Cycle 6: <4, (11, 17), 15>
- Cycle 7: <7, (14, 6), 18>
- Cycle 8: <7, (14, 3), 13>
- Cycle 9: <7, (14, 18), 12>
- Cycle 10: <7, (14, 19), 8>
- Cycle 11: <7, (14, 19), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 11 chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final number is [11].
