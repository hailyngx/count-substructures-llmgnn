Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 5) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 8) (10, 13) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 1) (3, 12) (3, 10) (3, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 10) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 9) (2, 1) (2, 10) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 3) (9, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 1, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 0, 7, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 7, 0, 5, 1>
- Cycle 4: <3, 12, 5, 0, 3>
- Cycle 5: <5, 12, 13, 11, 5>
- Cycle 6: <6, 1, 7, 0, 6>
- Cycle 7: <8, 5, 1, 6, 8>
- Cycle 8: <10, 8, 5, 0, 10>
- Cycle 9: <11, 13, 12, 5, 11>
- Cycle 10: <12, 9, 4, 7, 12>
- Cycle 11: <13, 14, 12, 5, 13>
- Cycle 12: <14, 8, 5, 1, 14>
- Cycle 13: <14, 12, 3, 10, 14>
- Cycle 14: <14, 9, 12, 4, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 1, 5, 0> has a chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 0, 7, 1> has a chord (0, 7)
- Cycle 8: <10, 8, 5, 0, 10> has a chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 11: <13, 14, 12, 5, 13> has a chord (12, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 14 cycles of length 4 or more and 4 of them have exactly one chord. So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 7, 1, 5, 0> with chord (1, 5)
<1, 5, 0, 7, 1> with chord (0, 7)
<10, 8, 5, 0, 10> with chord (5, 8)
<13, 14, 12, 5, 13> with chord (12, 5)
