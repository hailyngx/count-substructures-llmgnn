Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 2) (15, 8) (14, 17) (14, 0) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 11) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (13, 8) (10, 17) (10, 19) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 19) (0, 14) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 16) (12, 7) (12, 16) (12, 11) (12, 9) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 19) (4, 1) (18, 19) (18, 11) (18, 16) (19, 10) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 18) (19, 9) (16, 7) (16, 12) (16, 1) (16, 18) (11, 17) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 18) (9, 0) (9, 12) (9, 19) (2, 15) (2, 17) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: <3, 15, 2, 5, 8>
        - Cycle 2: <3, 8, 5, 2, 15>
        - Cycle 3: <3, 15, 8, 13, 5>
        - Cycle 4: <15, 8, 6, 19, 10, 17>
        - Cycle 5: <14, 17, 2, 15, 3>
        - Cycle 6: <14, 17, 11, 18, 16, 12, 7, 0>
        - Cycle 7: <14, 17, 11, 0, 9, 19, 6, 8>
        - Cycle 8: <14, 17, 11, 18, 16, 1, 19, 10>
        - Cycle 9: <14, 17, 11, 18, 16, 7, 0, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Cycle 1 has a chord: (8, 2)
        - Cycle 2 has a chord: (8, 15)
        - Cycle 4 has a chord: (15, 19)
        - Cycle 5 has a chord: (17, 3)
        - Cycle 6 has a chord: (11, 14)
        - Cycle 7 has a chord: (17, 8)
        - Cycle 8 has a chord: (17, 10)
        - Cycle 9 has a chord: (17, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

        There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
