Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 9) (13, 18) (22, 5) (22, 10) (22, 20) (4, 7) (4, 25) (4, 29) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 24) (7, 1) (10, 22) (10, 11) (10, 27) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 27) (11, 25) (11, 17) (12, 27) (12, 0) (27, 10) (27, 11) (27, 12) (27, 20) (1, 7) (1, 26) (1, 28) (26, 1) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 2) (2, 26) (2, 5) (2, 21) (8, 5) (8, 21) (8, 6) (19, 26) (19, 17) (19, 28) (19, 9) (23, 11) (23, 26) (3, 28) (3, 6) (28, 1) (28, 19) (28, 3) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 16) (24, 7) (24, 0) (17, 11) (17, 19) (17, 6) (5, 22) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 16) (15, 7) (15, 0) (15, 29) (15, 21) (0, 12) (0, 24) (0, 15) (14, 18) (18, 13) (18, 14) (18, 16) (18, 21) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 18) (29, 4) (29, 15) (20, 22) (20, 27) (25, 4) (25, 11) (21, 2) (21, 8) (21, 15) (21, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 22, 10, 27)
- Cycle 2: (1, 7, 24, 0)
- Cycle 3: (2, 26, 19, 17)
- Cycle 4: (11, 10, 22, 5)
- Cycle 5: (15, 7, 24, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: Chord (10, 27) -> <1, (10, 27), 5>
- Cycle 2: Chord (7, 24) -> <2, (7, 24), 0>
- Cycle 3: Chord (26, 19) -> <3, (26, 19), 17>
- Cycle 5: Chord (7, 24) -> <5, (7, 24), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]
