Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (3, 5, 4, 9, 3)
- Cycle 3: (1, 4, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 4, 9, 1, 3)
- Cycle 5: (1, 8, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 6: (3, 8, 4, 9, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 6, 7, 8, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 2, 6, 7, 3)
- Cycle 9: (4, 1, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 0, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 11: (9, 4, 1, 8, 9)
- Cycle 12: (9, 0, 4, 1, 9)
- Cycle 13: (5, 1, 8, 9, 5)
- Cycle 14: (5, 9, 4, 1, 5)
- Cycle 15: (6, 3, 8, 7, 6)
- Cycle 16: (6, 2, 3, 8, 6)
- Cycle 17: (7, 8, 1, 5, 7)
- Cycle 18: (7, 6, 0, 9, 7)
- Cycle 19: (8, 1, 5, 7, 8)
- Cycle 20: (8, 4, 1, 5, 8)
- Cycle 21: (0, 9, 4, 1, 0)
- Cycle 22: (0, 6, 3, 8, 0)

Step 2: Check for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1: Chord (5, 9) forms <1, (5, 9), 4>
- Cycle 2: Chord (5, 9) forms <2, (5, 9), 3>
- Cycle 3: Chord (4, 3) forms <3, (4, 3), 1>
- Cycle 4: Chord (4, 1) forms <4, (4, 1), 3>
- Cycle 5: Chord (8, 1) forms <5, (8, 1), 4>
- Cycle 6: Chord (8, 3) forms <6, (8, 3), 3>
- Cycle 7: Chord (6, 7) forms <7, (6, 7), 3>
- Cycle 8: Chord (6, 3) forms <8, (6, 3), 2>
- Cycle 9: Chord (8, 7) forms <9, (8, 7), 4>
- Cycle 10: Chord (0, 6) forms <10, (0, 6), 4>
- Cycle 11: Chord (8, 4) forms <11, (8, 4), 9>
- Cycle 12: Chord (9, 0) forms <12, (9, 0), 11>
- Cycle 13: Chord (5, 9) forms <13, (5, 9), 1>
- Cycle 14: Chord (1, 4) forms <14, (1, 4), 5>
- Cycle 15: Chord (6, 7) forms <15, (6, 7), 3>
- Cycle 16: Chord (3, 8) forms <16, (3, 8), 6>
- Cycle 17: Chord (1, 5) forms <17, (1, 5), 7>
- Cycle 18: Chord (7, 6) forms <18, (7, 6), 8>
- Cycle 19: Chord (8, 1) forms <19, (8, 1), 5>
- Cycle 20: Chord (1, 4) forms <20, (1, 4), 8>
- Cycle 21: Chord (9, 4) forms <21, (9, 4), 0>
- Cycle 22: Chord (0, 6) forms <22, (0, 6), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [22]
