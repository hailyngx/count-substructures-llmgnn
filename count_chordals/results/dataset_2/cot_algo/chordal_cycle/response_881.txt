Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 13) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 10) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) (7, 9) (7, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 0) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 10) (0, 4) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 14) (10, 13) 

Response:
Following the steps provided, we first need to list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle: 6-9-2-6
2. Cycle: 6-9-10-1-6
3. Cycle: 4-12-5-8-4
4. Cycle: 4-12-14-1-4
5. Cycle: 4-12-0-4
6. Cycle: 4-3-13-10-4
7. Cycle: 6-11-3-4-6
8. Cycle: 6-11-14-1-6
9. Cycle: 6-11-0-12-6
10. Cycle: 6-1-14-10-6

Next, we need to check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle 6-9-2-6 has exactly one chord (6, 2), forming a chordal 4-cycle <6, (6, 2), 9>.
- The cycle 6-9-10-1-6 has exactly one chord (9, 1), forming a chordal 4-cycle <6, (9, 1), 10>.
- The cycle 4-12-5-8-4 has exactly one chord (12, 5), forming a chordal 4-cycle <4, (12, 5), 8>.
- The cycle 6-11-3-4-6 has exactly one chord (11, 4), forming a chordal 4-cycle <6, (11, 4), 3>.
- The cycle 6-1-14-10-6 has exactly one chord (1, 10), forming a chordal 4-cycle <6, (1, 10), 14>.

Therefore, we have found 5 unique chordal 4-cycles, and the final count is [5].
