Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (10, 5), 3, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (4, 14), 3, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (10, 11), 3, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (5, 12), 10, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (7, 8), 3, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <3, (4, 14), 8, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, (7, 8), 1, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <3, (10, 11), 2, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, (8, 14), 3, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <5, (1, 12), 10, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <7, (3, 1), 8, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <8, (14, 4), 3, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <10, (1, 12), 5, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <11, (2, 1), 10, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <12, (1, 5), 10, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <14, (4, 2), 8, 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final answer is [16].
