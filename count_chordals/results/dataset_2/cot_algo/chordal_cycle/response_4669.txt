Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 6 - 4 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 6 - 5 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 8 - 1 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 4: 1 - 3 - 2 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 5: 2 - 3 - 5 - 0 - 2
- Cycle 6: 3 - 4 - 7 - 9 - 3

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 <0, 6, 4, 7>: Chords: (6, 4)
- Cycle 2 <0, 6, 5, 2>: Chords: (6, 5)
- Cycle 3 <0, 8, 1, 2>: Chords: (8, 1)
- Cycle 4 <1, 3, 2, 7>: Chords: (3, 2)
- Cycle 5 <2, 3, 5, 0>: Chords: (3, 5)
- Cycle 6 <3, 4, 7, 9>: Chords: (4, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 6, 4, 7> with chord (6, 4)
<0, 6, 5, 2> with chord (6, 5)
<0, 8, 1, 2> with chord (8, 1)
<1, 3, 2, 7> with chord (3, 2)
<2, 3, 5, 0> with chord (3, 5)
<3, 4, 7, 9> with chord (4, 7)
