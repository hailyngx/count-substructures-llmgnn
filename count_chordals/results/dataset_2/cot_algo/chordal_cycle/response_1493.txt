Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 14) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 6) (7, 16) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 18) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 10) (8, 6) (10, 8) (10, 15) (10, 18) (10, 13) (15, 10) (15, 19) (15, 6) (19, 4) (19, 15) (19, 14) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 15) (6, 17) (17, 11) (17, 12) (17, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (14, 16) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 19) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 10) (18, 12) (18, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:  
- Cycle 1: 0-5-1-2-0 
- Cycle 2: 3-7-8-6-3 
- Cycle 3: 3-14-19-15-10-13-3 
- Cycle 4: 4-19-15-10-8-6-4 
- Cycle 5: 4-19-14-3-7-8-6-4 
- Cycle 6: 5-1-13-10-15-6-5 
- Cycle 7: 5-14-16-13-1-5 
- Cycle 8: 6-4-19-14-16-7-6 
- Cycle 9: 7-16-14-19-4-6-8-7 
- Cycle 10: 8-7-3-9-12-17-6-8 
- Cycle 11: 9-11-13-1-2-9 
- Cycle 12: 9-12-17-6-8-10-9 
- Cycle 13: 10-13-1-5-0-3-14-10 
- Cycle 14: 11-13-10-15-19-14-16-11 
- Cycle 15: 12-9-3-14-19-4-6-12 
- Cycle 16: 16-14-19-15-10-13-16 
- Cycle 17: 17-12-9-11-13-10-18-17 
- Cycle 18: 18-10-13-16-14-19-15-18 

Step 2:
Cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (13), 10, 15> 
- <3, (14), 19, 4> 
- <3, (14), 19, 6> 

Step 3:
As we have found 3 unique chordal 4-cycles, the total count is [3].
