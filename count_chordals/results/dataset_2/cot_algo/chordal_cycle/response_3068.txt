Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 3) (4, 11) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 13) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (6, 3, 13, 12, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 12, 1, 11, 10, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 12, 13, 11, 10, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 10, 11, 1, 7, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 10, 2, 14, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 10, 7, 1, 2, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 10, 7, 12, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 14, 2, 8, 3, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 14, 0, 7, 10, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 14, 0, 9, 2, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 14, 3, 13, 12, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<6, 3, 13, 12, 6> - Chord: (6, 12)
<6, 12, 1, 11, 10, 6> - Chord: (6, 10)
<6, 12, 13, 11, 10, 6> - Chord: (6, 10)
<6, 10, 11, 1, 7, 6> - Chord: (6, 7)
<6, 10, 2, 14, 6> - Chord: (6, 14)
<6, 10, 7, 1, 2, 6> - Chord: (6, 2)
<6, 10, 7, 12, 6> - Chord: (6, 12)
<6, 14, 2, 8, 3, 6> - Chord: (6, 3)
<6, 14, 0, 7, 10, 6> - Chord: (6, 10)
<6, 14, 0, 9, 2, 6> - Chord: (6, 9)
<6, 14, 3, 13, 12, 6> - Chord: (6, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [0] chordless cycles found in the graph.
