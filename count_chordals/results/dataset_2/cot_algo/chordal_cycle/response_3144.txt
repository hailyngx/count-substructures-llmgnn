Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (9, 10) (9, 8) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 14) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more (chordal and non-chordal):
- Cycle 1: <1, 10, 8, 4, 12, 0, 3, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 10, 8, 4, 5, 13, 14, 3, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 11, 2, 8, 10, 12, 0, 3, 14, 13>
- Cycle 4: <1, 11, 7, 5, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 13>
- Cycle 5: <3, 0, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 13, 5, 6>
- Cycle 6: <3, 0, 4, 5, 7, 6, 2, 11, 1, 10>
- Cycle 7: <10, 1, 11, 7, 6, 4, 8, 13, 14, 0>
- Cycle 8: <10, 1, 11, 2, 6, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14>
- Cycle 9: <10, 8, 4, 12, 0, 14, 13, 5, 7, 11>
- Cycle 10: <10, 8, 13, 14, 3, 0, 4, 5, 7, 11>
- Cycle 11: <11, 1, 10, 12, 0, 3, 14, 13, 5, 7>
- Cycle 12: <11, 2, 8, 4, 12, 0, 3, 14, 13, 7>
- Cycle 13: <8, 10, 12, 4, 5, 7, 6, 2, 11, 1>
- Cycle 14: <8, 13, 14, 3, 1, 10, 12, 4, 5, 7>
- Cycle 15: <4, 8, 10, 12, 0, 14, 13, 5, 7, 6>
- Cycle 16: <4, 0, 3, 14, 13, 5, 7, 6, 2, 11>
- Cycle 17: <5, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 3, 0, 6, 7>
- Cycle 18: <6, 4, 0, 3, 14, 13, 5, 7, 11, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 10, 8, 4, 12, 0, 3, 1> (Chord: (10, 8))
- <1, 10, 8, 4, 5, 13, 14, 3, 1> (Chord: (4, 3))
- <1, 11, 2, 8, 10, 12, 0, 3, 14, 13> (Chord: (8, 14))
- <1, 11, 7, 5, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 13> (Chord: (4, 14))
- <3, 0, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14, 13, 5, 6> (Chord: (4, 5))
- <3, 0, 4, 5, 7, 6, 2, 11, 1, 10> (Chord: (4, 11))
- <10, 1, 11, 7, 6, 4, 8, 13, 14, 0> (Chord: (8, 14))
- <10, 1, 11, 2, 6, 4, 8, 10, 12, 14> (Chord: (4, 12))
- <10, 8, 13, 14, 3, 0, 4, 5, 7, 11> (Chord: (3, 5))
- <11, 1, 10, 12, 0, 3, 14, 13, 5, 7> (Chord: (3, 5))
- <11, 2, 8, 4, 12, 0, 3, 14, 13, 7> (Chord: (8, 14))
- <8, 10, 12, 4, 5, 7, 6, 2, 11, 1> (Chord: (10, 2))
- <8, 13, 14, 3, 1, 10, 12, 4, 5, 7> (Chord: (1, 3))
- <4, 8, 10, 12, 0, 14, 13, 5, 7, 6> (Chord: (8, 14))
- <6, 4, 0, 3, 14, 13, 5, 7, 11, 2> (Chord: (4, 13))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [13]
