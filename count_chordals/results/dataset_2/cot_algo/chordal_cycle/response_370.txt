Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 0) (11, 17) (16, 13) (16, 14) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 15) (7, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 18) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 16) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 15) (17, 11) (17, 6) (17, 19) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 14) (18, 3) (18, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 1) (6, 17) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 0) (15, 7) (15, 10) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (19, 17) (19, 2) (19, 0) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle: (3, 1, 6, 17, 11, 0)
- Cycle: (12, 1, 6, 17, 11, 0)
- Cycle: (12, 1, 6, 17, 19, 0)
- Cycle: (12, 1, 6, 17, 19, 2)
- Cycle: (12, 1, 4, 10, 15, 7)
- Cycle: (12, 1, 4, 10, 15, 9)
- Cycle: (12, 1, 4, 5, 14, 16)
- Cycle: (12, 1, 3, 9, 15, 7)
- Cycle: (12, 1, 3, 9, 15, 10)
- Cycle: (12, 1, 3, 9, 7, 15)
- Cycle: (12, 3, 1, 4, 5, 14)
- Cycle: (12, 3, 1, 6, 17, 11)
- Cycle: (12, 3, 1, 6, 17, 19)
- Cycle: (12, 3, 1, 6, 17, 0)
- Cycle: (12, 3, 9, 7, 15, 10)
- Cycle: (12, 3, 9, 7, 15, 1)
- Cycle: (12, 3, 9, 15, 10, 4)
- Cycle: (12, 8, 10, 15, 9, 7)
- Cycle: (12, 8, 0, 11, 17, 6)
- Cycle: (12, 8, 0, 11, 17, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, (1, 6), 17, 11, 0> (Chord: (1, 6))
- <12, (1, 6), 17, 11, 0> (Chord: (1, 6))
- <12, (1, 6), 17, 19, 0> (Chord: (1, 6))
- <12, (1, 6), 17, 19, 2> (Chord: (1, 6))
- <12, (1, 4), 10, 15, 7> (Chord: (1, 4))
- <12, (1, 4), 10, 15, 9> (Chord: (1, 4))
- <12, (1, 4), 5, 14, 16> (Chord: (1, 4))
- <12, (1, 3), 9, 15, 7> (Chord: (1, 3))
- <12, (1, 3), 9, 15, 10> (Chord: (1, 3))
- <12, (1, 3), 9, 7, 15> (Chord: (1, 3))
- <12, (3, 1), 4, 5, 14> (Chord: (1, 4))
- <12, (3, 1), 6, 17, 11> (Chord: (1, 6))
- <12, (3, 1), 6, 17, 19> (Chord: (1, 6))
- <12, (3, 1), 6, 17, 0> (Chord: (1, 6))
- <12, (3, 9), 7, 15, 10> (Chord: (3, 9))
- <12, (3, 9), 7, 15, 1> (Chord: (3, 9))
- <12, (3, 9), 15, 10, 4> (Chord: (3, 9))
- <12, 8, 10, 15, 9, 7> (Chord: (10, 15))
- <12, 8, 0, 11, 17, 6> (Chord: (11, 17))
- <12, 8, 0, 11, 17, 19> (Chord: (11, 17))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
  
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [12].
