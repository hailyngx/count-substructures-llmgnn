Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 9) (15, 14) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 14) (9, 15) (9, 5) (9, 18) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 8) (13, 17) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 0) (11, 1) (11, 17) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 19) (10, 2) (17, 13) (17, 11) (17, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 16) (16, 7) (16, 4) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 19) (18, 9) (18, 6) (18, 12) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 2) (19, 10) (19, 0) (19, 2) (8, 6) (8, 12) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 1) (2, 19) (2, 4) (14, 15) (14, 5) (12, 17) (12, 18) (12, 8) (4, 16) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists -

Cycles:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-15-14-5
- Cycle 2: 6-18-9-15-6
- Cycle 3: 13-1-11-17-13
- Cycle 4: 13-0-10-19-13
- Cycle 5: 2-1-11-17-2
- Cycle 6: 7-3-15-13-7
- Cycle 7: 4-16 -7-13 -4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord -

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <5, 9, 15, 14> (Chord: 9-14)
- <13, 1, 11, 17> (Chord: 1-17)
- <13, 0, 10, 19> (Chord: 0-10)
- <2, 1, 11, 17> (Chord: 1-11)
- <7, 3, 15, 13> (Chord: 3-15)
- <4, 16, 7, 13> (Chord: 16-13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found -

There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [6].
