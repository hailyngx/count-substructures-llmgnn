Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 10) (4, 3) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (11, 13) (11, 4) (11, 0) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 6) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 11) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 14) (10, 3) (10, 7) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-8-1-5
- Cycle 2: 5-12-7-9-5
- Cycle 3: 5-1-2-13-5
- Cycle 4: 5-3-6-7-5
- Cycle 5: 5-3-4-13-5
- Cycle 6: 9-8-13-4-9
- Cycle 7: 9-7-6-3-9
- Cycle 8: 1-8-13-2-1
- Cycle 9: 1-3-0-13-1
- Cycle 10: 3-6-14-7-3
- Cycle 11: 3-4-12-7-3
- Cycle 12: 8-9-7-12-8
- Cycle 13: 8-1-3-0-8
- Cycle 14: 13-2-10-7-13
- Cycle 15: 13-4-0-11-13
- Cycle 16: 7-12-4-13-7
- Cycle 17: 1-3-5-9-1
- Cycle 18: 1-8-9-7-1
- Cycle 19: 3-4-6-7-3
- Cycle 20: 13-2-1-5-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 5: 5-3-4-13-5 has a chord (3, 13)
- Cycle 13: 8-1-3-0-8 has a chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 15: 13-4-0-11-13 has a chord (4, 11)
- Cycle 20: 13-2-1-5-13 has a chord (1, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 17

Therefore, the final answer is [17].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <5, (3, 13), 4, 5>
- <8, (1, 3), 0, 8>
- <13, (4, 11), 0, 13>
- <13, (1, 5), 2, 13>
