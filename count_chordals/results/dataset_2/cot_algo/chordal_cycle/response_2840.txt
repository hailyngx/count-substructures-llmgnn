Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 9) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 8) (3, 15) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 8) (15, 12) (10, 17) (10, 4) (17, 10) (17, 2) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 18) (18, 3) (18, 8) (18, 5) (18, 7) (1, 16) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 0) (0, 16) (0, 1) (7, 18) (7, 13) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (6, 14) (6, 19) (2, 17) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 13) (19, 6) (19, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (5, 4) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 12) (12, 15) (12, 9) (12, 5) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: 0 - 16 - 1 - 5 - 0
        - Cycle 2: 0 - 1 - 13 - 7 - 18 - 8 - 0
        - Cycle 3: 2 - 17 - 10 - 4 - 8 - 2
        - Cycle 4: 2 - 17 - 10 - 4 - 5 - 1 - 16 - 8 - 2
        - Cycle 5: 2 - 13 - 1 - 16 - 8 - 2
        - Cycle 6: 3 - 15 - 12 - 9 - 11 - 3
        - Cycle 7: 3 - 15 - 12 - 5 - 4 - 10 - 17 - 2 - 13 - 3
        - Cycle 8: 3 - 15 - 8 - 18 - 7 - 13 - 3
        - Cycle 9: 4 - 10 - 17 - 2 - 13 - 9 - 12 - 5 - 4
        - Cycle 10: 5 - 12 - 15 - 3 - 18 - 7 - 13 - 1 - 5
        - Cycle 11: 5 - 18 - 7 - 13 - 1 - 16 - 8 - 4 - 5
        - Cycle 12: 6 - 14 - 9 - 11 - 3 - 18 - 7 - 13 - 6
        - Cycle 13: 9 - 11 - 3 - 18 - 8 - 16 - 1 - 13 - 9
        
Step 2: Check for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: Has exactly one chord
        - Cycle 2: Has exactly one chord
        - Cycle 3: Has exactly one chord
        - Cycle 4: Has exactly one chord
        - Cycle 5: Has exactly one chord
        - Cycle 6: Does not have a chord
        - Cycle 7: Does not have a chord
        - Cycle 8: Does not have a chord
        - Cycle 9: Does not have a chord
        - Cycle 10: Does not have a chord
        - Cycle 11: Does not have a chord
        - Cycle 12: Does not have a chord
        - Cycle 13: Does not have a chord
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found
        
Therefore, the final count is [5].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
        - <0, 1, 5, 16>, with 13 as the chord
        - <0, 1, 13, 2>, with 16 as the chord
        - <2, 13, 1, 16>, with 8 as the chord
        - <2, 17, 10, 4>, with 8 as the chord
        - <2, 17, 10, 4>, with 5 as the chord
