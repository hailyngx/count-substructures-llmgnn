Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 10) (22, 17) (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 29) (9, 20) (2, 18) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 25) (5, 6) (5, 29) (5, 27) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 29) (0, 12) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 10) (19, 26) (19, 8) (19, 25) (19, 24) (26, 18) (26, 19) (26, 8) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 19) (8, 26) (3, 21) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 16) (11, 3) (11, 23) (11, 7) (11, 12) (17, 22) (17, 28) (20, 9) (20, 28) (15, 1) (15, 23) (23, 18) (23, 11) (23, 15) (23, 16) (23, 27) (29, 9) (29, 5) (29, 0) (29, 24) (7, 11) (7, 24) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 25) (28, 17) (28, 20) (28, 27) (24, 0) (24, 19) (24, 29) (24, 7) (16, 2) (16, 3) (16, 23) (25, 18) (25, 19) (25, 12) (10, 13) (10, 14) (10, 27) (27, 5) (27, 23) (27, 28) (27, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 21, 3, 6, 5, 29, 24, 0, 14, 10, 13, 9)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 1, 15, 23, 18, 2, 16, 3, 21)
- Cycle 3: (17, 22, 17, 28, 20, 9, 6, 3, 11, 7)
- Cycle 4: (1, 4, 1, 21, 3, 6, 5, 27, 23, 18)
- Cycle 5: (8, 9, 6, 5, 29, 24, 0, 12, 11, 23, 16)
- Cycle 6: (1, 4, 1, 21, 3, 6, 9, 20, 28, 17)

Step 2:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (5, 24)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (3, 16)
- Cycle 3 has no chords
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (5, 23)
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (6, 23)
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (6, 17)

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph: <1, (5, 24), 21, 3), <2, (3, 16), 21, 1), <4, (5, 23), 21, 1), <6, (6, 17), 9, 20)>.
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [4].
