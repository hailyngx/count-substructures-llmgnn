Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-1-3-6-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-4-6-5
- Cycle 3: 5-1-8-6-5
- Cycle 4: 5-3-1-4-5
- Cycle 5: 3-1-4-6-3

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, (1, 3), 6>
- <5, (1, 4), 6>
- <5, (1, 8), 6>
- <5, (3, 4), 1>
- <3, (1, 4), 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
