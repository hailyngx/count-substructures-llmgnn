Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 8) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 11) (10, 9) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 14) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 5) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 8) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- <1, 14, 7, 12, 1>
- <3, 12, 7, 11, 3>
- <4, 13, 7, 12, 4>
- <5, 11, 7, 13, 5>
- <9, 10, 11, 7, 14, 9>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 14, 7, 12, 1> contains exactly one chord (7, 12).
- <3, 12, 7, 11, 3> contains exactly one chord (7, 11).
- <4, 13, 7, 12, 4> contains exactly one chord (7, 12).
- <5, 11, 7, 13, 5> contains exactly one chord (7, 13).
- <9, 10, 11, 7, 14, 9> contains exactly one chord (11, 14).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 14, 7, 12, 1>
- <3, 12, 7, 11, 3>
- <4, 13, 7, 12, 4>
- <5, 11, 7, 13, 5>
- <9, 10, 11, 7, 14, 9>
