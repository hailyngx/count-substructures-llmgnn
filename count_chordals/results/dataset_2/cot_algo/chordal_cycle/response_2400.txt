Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 

- Cycle 1: <1, 2, 3, 7>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 5, 7>
- Cycle 3: <1, 7, 0, 9>
- Cycle 4: <2, 3, 7, 9>
- Cycle 5: <2, 4, 5, 9>
- Cycle 6: <3, 6, 5, 7>
- Cycle 7: <5, 6, 0, 7>
- Cycle 8: <5, 8, 9, 4>
- Cycle 9: <6, 0, 2, 3>
- Cycle 10: <0, 2, 9, 7>

Step 2:

- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - <1, 2, 3, 7> has chord (2, 7)
    - <1, 4, 5, 7> has chord (4, 7)
    - <1, 7, 0, 9> has chord (7, 9)
    - <2, 3, 7, 9> has chord (3, 9)
    - <2, 4, 5, 9> has chord (4, 5)
    - <3, 6, 5, 7> has chord (5, 6)
    - <5, 6, 0, 7> has chord (6, 7)
    - <5, 8, 9, 4> has chord (8, 9)
    - <6, 0, 2, 3> has chord (0, 2)
    - <0, 2, 9, 7> has chord (2, 7)

Step 3:

- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, 2, 3, 7> with chord (2, 7)
<1, 4, 5, 7> with chord (4, 7)
<1, 7, 0, 9> with chord (7, 9)
<2, 3, 7, 9> with chord (3, 9)
<2, 4, 5, 9> with chord (4, 5)
<3, 6, 5, 7> with chord (5, 6)
<5, 6, 0, 7> with chord (6, 7)
<5, 8, 9, 4> with chord (8, 9)
<6, 0, 2, 3> with chord (0, 2)
<0, 2, 9, 7> with chord (2, 7)
