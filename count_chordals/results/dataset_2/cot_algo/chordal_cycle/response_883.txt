Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 21) (9, 23) (26, 9) (26, 12) (14, 11) (14, 24) (17, 19) (18, 22) (18, 16) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 4) (4, 22) (4, 27) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 20) (2, 11) (21, 9) (21, 28) (21, 23) (21, 25) (21, 29) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 12) (13, 11) (13, 7) (20, 2) (20, 23) (20, 11) (20, 10) (27, 4) (27, 3) (27, 5) (15, 16) (15, 1) (15, 7) (15, 5) (16, 18) (16, 15) (16, 7) (16, 10) (1, 28) (1, 15) (1, 25) (24, 14) (24, 6) (24, 19) (7, 13) (7, 15) (7, 16) (6, 24) (6, 29) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 20) (29, 21) (29, 6) (29, 25) (29, 3) (3, 8) (3, 27) (3, 29) (25, 21) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 0) (10, 20) (10, 16) (10, 5) (0, 25) (0, 12) (19, 17) (19, 24) (5, 27) (5, 15) (5, 10) (12, 26) (12, 18) (12, 28) (12, 0) (12, 23) (23, 9) (23, 21) (23, 20) (23, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (9, 26, 12, 31, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 23, 21, 28, 1, 15, 7, 13, 11, 14, 24, 6, 29, 25, 0, 12, 18, 22, 4, 27, 3, 8, 2, 20, 10, 5, 15, 16, 18, 12, 28, 21, 25, 29, 6, 24, 19, 17, 19, 24, 14, 11, 2, 8, 3, 27, 4, 22, 18, 16, 7, 13, 7, 15, 1, 28, 12, 26, 9, 21, 23)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The only chordal 4-cycle found is <9, 12, 26, 21>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Since there was only one chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [1].
