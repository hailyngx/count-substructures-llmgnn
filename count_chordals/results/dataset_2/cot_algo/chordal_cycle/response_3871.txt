Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 16) (7, 4) (7, 15) (7, 18) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 8) (14, 4) (14, 17) (17, 14) (17, 2) (17, 18) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 6) (8, 3) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 2) (19, 3) (19, 16) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 17) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 15) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 10) (16, 19) (16, 12) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 18) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 0) (15, 18) (0, 15) (18, 7) (18, 17) (18, 5) (18, 15) (13, 4) 

Response:
Step 1:  
There are several cycles in the graph that have a length of 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-15-2-4
- Cycle 2: 4-16-12-3-4
- Cycle 3: 4-14-17-2-4
- Cycle 4: 7-18-15-2-7
- Cycle 5: 7-18-17-14-4-7
- Cycle 6: 3-12-16-4-3
- Cycle 7: 3-8-9-2-3
- Cycle 8: 3-1-5-2-3
- Cycle 9: 7-15-0-18-7
- Cycle 10: 16-19-3-12-16

Step 2:  
The cycles that have exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes) are:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-15-2-4 with chord (15, 2)
- Cycle 2: 4-16-12-3-4 with chord (12, 3)
- Cycle 3: 3-1-5-2-3 with chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 4: 16-19-3-12-16 with chord (3, 12)

Step 3:  
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <4, 7, 15, 2> with chord (15, 2)
- <4, 16, 12, 3> with chord (12, 3)
- <3, 1, 5, 2> with chord (1, 5)
- <16, 19, 3, 12> with chord (3, 12)
