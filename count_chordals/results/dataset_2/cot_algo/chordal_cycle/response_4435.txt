Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 18) (14, 4) (10, 11) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 8) (11, 15) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 19) (13, 8) (13, 16) (13, 19) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (19, 8) (19, 13) (19, 3) (19, 12) (15, 11) (15, 18) (15, 12) (7, 6) (7, 16) (7, 3) (16, 10) (16, 13) (16, 7) (18, 9) (18, 14) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 3) (3, 19) (3, 7) (3, 18) (3, 4) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (12, 19) (12, 15) (12, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 9, 2, 0, 5)
- (5, 11, 15, 12, 5)
- (9, 18, 15, 12, 9)
- (14, 18, 15, 12, 14)
- (10, 11, 15, 12, 10)
- (8, 11, 15, 12, 8)
- (13, 8, 11, 15, 13)
- (6, 5, 11, 15, 6)
- (4, 2, 9, 18, 4)
- (19, 8, 13, 16, 19)
- (19, 13, 16, 7, 19)
- (15, 11, 10, 16, 15)
- (6, 7, 3, 18, 6)
- (2, 0, 6, 7, 2)
- (4, 1, 5, 11, 4)
- (0, 2, 9, 5, 0)
- (12, 15, 11, 8, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordless cycles:
- <5, 9, 2, 0, 5>
- <5, 11, 15, 12, 5>
- <9, 18, 15, 12, 9>
- <14, 18, 15, 12, 14>
- <10, 11, 15, 12, 10>
- <8, 11, 15, 12, 8>
- <13, 8, 11, 15, 13>
- <6, 5, 11, 15, 6>
- <4, 2, 9, 18, 4>
- <19, 8, 13, 16, 19>
- <19, 13, 16, 7, 19>
- <15, 11, 10, 16, 15>
- <6, 7, 3, 18, 6>
- <2, 0, 6, 7, 2>
- <4, 1, 5, 11, 4>
- <0, 2, 9, 5, 0>
- <12, 15, 11, 8, 12>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [17].
