Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Possible 4-cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 6, 9, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 2, 6, 9, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 2, 7, 8, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 5, 8, 7, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

Out of the 4-cycles listed above, only Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 have exactly one chord. 

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 1, 6, 9> with a chord (0, 9)
- <0, 2, 7, 8> with a chord (0, 7)
