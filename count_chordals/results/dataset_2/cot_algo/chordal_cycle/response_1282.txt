Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 9) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 15) (0, 4) (0, 2) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 19) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 14) (1, 2) (1, 5) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 17) (5, 3) (5, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (8, 10) (6, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 15) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 10) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (10, 18) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 7 -> 12 -> 4 -> 0 -> 7
- Cycle 2: 7 -> 12 -> 17 -> 16 -> 19 -> 7
- Cycle 3: 7 -> 11 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 4 -> 12 -> 7
- Cycle 4: 12 -> 17 -> 16 -> 8 -> 3 -> 11 -> 7 -> 12
- Cycle 5: 12 -> 9 -> 18 -> 4 -> 12
- Cycle 6: 4 -> 18 -> 9 -> 14 -> 2 -> 0 -> 4
- Cycle 7: 4 -> 6 -> 4
- Cycle 8: 18 -> 10 -> 2 -> 14 -> 15 -> 17 -> 12 -> 4 -> 18
- Cycle 9: 3 -> 8 -> 16 -> 19 -> 7 -> 11 -> 3
- Cycle 10: 16 -> 13 -> 12 -> 17 -> 16
- Cycle 11: 0 -> 2 -> 1 -> 5 -> 3 -> 8 -> 16 -> 19 -> 0
- Cycle 12: 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 14 -> 15 -> 11 -> 7 -> 19 -> 5
- Cycle 13: 9 -> 18 -> 10 -> 8 -> 3 -> 11 -> 7 -> 12 -> 9
- Cycle 14: 19 -> 17 -> 12 -> 4 -> 0 -> 2 -> 10 -> 18 -> 9 -> 19
- Cycle 15: 2 -> 10 -> 18 -> 4 -> 12 -> 13 -> 16 -> 8 -> 3 -> 2

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <7, 12, 4, 0, (7, 4)>
- <7, 12, 17, 16, 19, (7, 16)>
- <7, 11, 3, 5, 1, 2, 0, 4, (7, 0)>
- <12, 17, 16, 8, 3, 11, 7, (12, 7)>
- <12, 9, 18, 4, (12, 4)>
- <4, 18, 9, 14, 2, 0, (4, 0)>
- <5, 1, 2, 14, 15, 11, 7, (5, 7)>
- <9, 18, 10, 8, 3, 11, 7, (9, 7)>
- <16, 13, 12, 17, (16, 17)>
- <10, 18, 9, 14, 15, 17, 12, (10, 12)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0].
