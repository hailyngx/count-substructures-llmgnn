Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 16) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 18) (2, 1) (2, 12) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 8) (7, 1) (7, 17) (12, 2) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 17) (19, 17) (19, 10) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 11) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 15) (17, 7) (17, 5) (17, 19) (17, 13) (17, 11) (4, 16) (4, 14) (0, 18) (0, 16) (16, 9) (16, 4) (16, 0) (16, 10) (14, 3) (14, 4) (14, 15) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 14) (10, 6) (10, 19) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
The cycles in the graph are:
1. (6, 9, 16, 4)
2. (1, 3, 8, 18)
3. (1, 3, 14, 4)
4. (1, 5, 17, 13)
5. (1, 7, 17, 13)
6. (1, 2, 12, 2)
7. (3, 14, 4, 16)
8. (3, 8, 15, 13)
9. (2, 12, 2, 1)
10. (5, 11, 17, 7)
11. (17, 13, 15, 14)
12. (10, 19, 17, 13)
13. (10, 19, 17, 5)
14. (10, 19, 17, 7)
15. (10, 19, 17, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, 3, 8, 18> with a chord (1, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 14 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
