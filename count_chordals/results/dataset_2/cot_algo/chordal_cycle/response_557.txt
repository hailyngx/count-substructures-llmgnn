Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 7) (17, 4) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 13) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 14) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 12) (5, 15) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 0) (13, 6) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 0) (7, 19) (3, 18) (3, 6) (3, 12) (1, 2) (1, 16) (1, 9) (9, 1) (9, 19) (9, 12) (15, 5) (15, 14) (15, 16) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 15) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 12) (14, 2) (14, 15) (19, 13) (19, 7) (19, 9) (11, 0) (12, 18) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. (4, 13, 6, 10)
2. (4, 18, 7, 0)
3. (4, 18, 12, 3)
4. (4, 13, 19, 9)
5. (4, 17, 18, 7)
6. (4, 17, 18, 12)
7. (4, 17, 18, 3)
8. (4, 18, 3, 6)
9. (4, 13, 6, 3)
10. (18, 3, 12, 9)

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
1. <4, 13, 6, 10> (chord: (4, 10))
2. <4, 18, 7, 0> (chord: (18, 7))
3. <4, 18, 12, 3> (chord: (18, 12))
4. <4, 13, 19, 9> (chord: (13, 19))
5. <4, 17, 18, 7> (chord: (17, 18))
6. <4, 17, 18, 12> (chord: (17, 18))
7. <4, 17, 18, 3> (chord: (17, 18))
8. <4, 18, 3, 6> (chord: (18, 6))
9. <4, 13, 6, 3> (chord: (13, 3))
10. <18, 3, 12, 9> (chord: (3, 9))

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
