Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 9) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 2) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 12) (0, 13) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 6) (8, 2) (3, 10) (3, 11) (3, 14) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 9) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 9) (12, 1) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 9, 13)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 11, 10)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 8, 2)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 10, 3)
- Cycle 5: (1, 12, 0, 13)
- Cycle 6: (2, 5, 7, 4)
- Cycle 7: (2, 5, 13, 1)
- Cycle 8: (2, 7, 4, 11)
- Cycle 9: (2, 7, 5, 13)
- Cycle 10: (2, 8, 6, 10)
- Cycle 11: (3, 10, 6, 1)
- Cycle 12: (3, 10, 11, 4)
- Cycle 13: (3, 11, 9, 4)
- Cycle 14: (3, 11, 14, 1)
- Cycle 15: (4, 5, 7, 2)
- Cycle 16: (4, 7, 11, 14)
- Cycle 17: (4, 9, 11, 14)
- Cycle 18: (5, 7, 2, 8)
- Cycle 19: (5, 13, 0, 12)
- Cycle 20: (6, 8, 2, 7)
- Cycle 21: (9, 4, 11, 14)
- Cycle 22: (9, 11, 3, 10)
- Cycle 23: (9, 13, 1, 4)
- Cycle 24: (12, 0, 13, 9)
  
Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <1, (6, 10), 3)>
- Chordal Cycle 2: <2, (5, 7), 4)>
- Chordal Cycle 3: <4, (7, 11), 14)>
- Chordal Cycle 4: <9, (11, 3), 10)>
- Chordal Cycle 5: <13, (1, 4), 9)>
- Chordal Cycle 6: <4, (9, 11), 14)>
- Chordal Cycle 7: <12, (0, 13), 9)>

Step 3:
There are [7] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
