Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 26) (13, 21) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 11) (22, 0) (22, 29) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (14, 17) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 28) (17, 11) (12, 27) (27, 12) (27, 29) (27, 24) (27, 6) (6, 7) (6, 27) (6, 28) (6, 11) (6, 16) (28, 17) (28, 6) (28, 21) (1, 26) (1, 16) (26, 13) (26, 1) (26, 24) (26, 20) (21, 13) (21, 28) (21, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 18) (11, 22) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 3) (24, 27) (24, 26) (24, 8) (24, 2) (20, 26) (0, 22) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (10, 2) (10, 23) (10, 25) (23, 10) (23, 29) (15, 19) (15, 8) (15, 5) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 25) (5, 0) (5, 15) (5, 8) (9, 13) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 25) (25, 10) (25, 19) (25, 9) (8, 24) (8, 15) (8, 5) (2, 24) (2, 10) (29, 22) (29, 27) (29, 23) (16, 14) (16, 6) (16, 1) (18, 21) (18, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: {13, 22, 11, 6, 13}
- Cycle 2: {13, 22, 0, 7, 6, 13}
- Cycle 3: {13, 22, 29, 27, 12, 13}
- Cycle 4: {4, 9, 7, 6, 27, 4}
- Cycle 5: {17, 14, 16, 1, 26, 17}
- Cycle 6: {17, 14, 16, 1, 26, 24, 27, 6, 17}
- Cycle 7: {17, 14, 16, 1, 26, 24, 2, 10, 25, 19, 15, 5, 8, 24, 27, 6, 17}
- Cycle 8: {17, 14, 16, 1, 26, 24, 2, 10, 23, 29, 22, 13, 9, 25, 19, 15, 5, 0, 4, 9, 7, 6, 28, 17}
- Cycle 9: {17, 14, 16, 1, 26, 24, 27, 6, 11, 3, 19, 25, 9, 13, 22, 29, 23, 10, 2, 24, 8, 15, 5, 0, 7, 9, 4, 27, 17}
- Cycle 10: {17, 14, 16, 1, 26, 24, 27, 29, 23, 10, 2, 24, 8, 15, 19, 3, 11, 6, 7, 0, 22, 13, 9, 4, 27, 17}
- Cycle 11: {17, 14, 16, 1, 26, 24, 8, 15, 19, 25, 10, 2, 24, 27, 12, 29, 22, 13, 9, 7, 0, 4, 27, 6, 11, 3, 18, 21, 28, 17}

Step 2 & 3: Checking for chords in each cycle and counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (16, 26), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (10, 24), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (19, 25), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (9, 7), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (15, 19), 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (27, 22), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (13, 6), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (24, 16), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, (17, 1), 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, (2, 23), 29>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <11, (3, 16), 14>

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
