Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 18) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (0, 20) (0, 22) (0, 8) (27, 14) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 9) (25, 6) (25, 23) (22, 0) (22, 6) (22, 10) (23, 25) (23, 17) (23, 29) (5, 9) (5, 29) (5, 11) (5, 21) (9, 25) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 13) (20, 0) (20, 8) (20, 28) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 28) (7, 17) (12, 7) (4, 9) (4, 18) (4, 21) (18, 3) (18, 4) (18, 13) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 14) (8, 0) (8, 20) (13, 9) (13, 18) (26, 10) (26, 29) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 1) (19, 15) (19, 10) (16, 7) (16, 2) (16, 1) (17, 15) (17, 25) (17, 23) (17, 7) (10, 22) (10, 7) (10, 26) (10, 19) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 16) (21, 5) (21, 4) (21, 24) (24, 21) (6, 25) (6, 22) (6, 29) (29, 23) (29, 5) (29, 26) (29, 6) (28, 20) (28, 7) (28, 14) (14, 27) (14, 2) (14, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: <3, 15, 19, 17, 3>
        - Cycle 2: <3, 11, 5, 9, 25, 3>
        - Cycle 3: <3, 18, 4, 9, 25, 3>
        - Cycle 4: <3, 25, 23, 29, 6, 22, 0, 20, 8, 22, 6, 25, 3>
        - Cycle 5: <0, 20, 8, 22, 6, 25, 23, 29, 26, 10, 19, 15, 17, 23, 25, 6, 22, 0>
        - Cycle 6: <7, 12, 14, 2, 16, 7>
        - Cycle 7: <7, 16, 1, 11, 5, 9, 4, 18, 13, 9, 5, 11, 1, 2, 14, 27, 7>
        - Cycle 8: <7, 17, 23, 25, 17>
        - Cycle 9: <10, 22, 0, 20, 8, 28, 14, 2, 1, 16, 7, 10>
        - Cycle 10: <10, 19, 15, 17, 7, 16, 2, 14, 28, 20, 0, 22, 6, 25, 9, 4, 18, 13, 9, 5, 11, 1, 2, 7, 17, 23, 29, 6, 22, 10>
        - Cycle 11: <21, 5, 9, 4, 18, 13, 9, 25, 3, 15, 19, 10, 7, 17, 23, 25, 6, 29, 26, 10, 19, 21>
        - Cycle 12: <24, 21, 5, 11, 1, 2, 14, 27, 7, 16, 2, 10, 19, 21>
        - Cycle 13: <26, 10, 19, 15, 17, 7, 28, 20, 0, 22, 6, 29, 23, 17, 25, 6, 22, 0, 8, 20, 28, 14, 2, 16, 7, 12, 14, 27, 2, 1, 11, 5, 29, 26>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Only Cycle 1 has exactly one non-adjacent edge: (3, 17) as the chord
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        - There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found
        
Therefore, the final number is [1]. 
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <3, (3, 17), 15, 19>.
