Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (3, 12) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (8, 9) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (6, 12) (6, 13) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 0) (0, 11) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: 
1. Cycle <5, 9, 13, 5>
2. Cycle <7, 11, 13, 6>
3. Cycle <3, 11, 14, 2>
4. Cycle <3, 4, 10, 1>
5. Cycle <4, 5, 2, 1>
6. Cycle <4, 10, 12, 6>
7. Cycle <0, 11, 1, 4>

Step 2:
Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 13, 5> has a chord (9, 13).
2. Cycle <7, 11, 13, 6> has a chord (7, 13).
3. Cycle <3, 11, 14, 2> has a chord (3, 14).
4. Cycle <3, 4, 10, 1> has a chord (3, 10).
5. Cycle <4, 5, 2, 1> has a chord (5, 1).
6. Cycle <4, 10, 12, 6> has a chord (10, 12).
7. Cycle <0, 11, 1, 4> has a chord (11, 1).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
