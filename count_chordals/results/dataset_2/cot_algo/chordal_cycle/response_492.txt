Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 3) (16, 8) (6, 9) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 19) (10, 9) (10, 17) (10, 13) (10, 5) (17, 10) (17, 0) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (8, 16) (8, 1) (8, 18) (4, 17) (4, 19) (18, 17) (18, 8) (18, 1) (5, 10) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 7) (3, 19) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 8) (1, 18) (1, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (15, 17) (15, 13) (19, 9) (19, 4) (19, 3) (19, 14) (12, 1) (12, 14) (14, 7) (14, 19) (14, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 8, 1, 18, 17, 10, 13, 6, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 2: (11, 16, 8, 18, 17, 4, 19, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 3: (11, 16, 8, 18, 17, 10, 13, 15, 17, 4, 19, 9)
- Cycle 4: (11, 16, 8, 18, 1, 12, 14, 19, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, (18, 17), 10, 13, 6, 9, 7, 3> (Chord: (18, 17))
- <11, (16, 8), 18, 17, 4, 19, 9, 7, 3> (Chord: (16, 8))
- <11, 16, 8, (18, 1), 12, 14, 19, 9> (Chord: (18, 1))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

- There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [3].
