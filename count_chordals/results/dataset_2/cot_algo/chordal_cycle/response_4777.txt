Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 23) (3, 8) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 4) (15, 2) (14, 28) (14, 16) (17, 20) (17, 23) (17, 11) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 27) (0, 27) (0, 29) (0, 19) (27, 1) (27, 0) (27, 19) (22, 23) (22, 26) (23, 3) (23, 17) (23, 22) (23, 26) (23, 10) (28, 14) (28, 8) (28, 12) (29, 0) (29, 5) (29, 10) (26, 22) (26, 23) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 21) (13, 1) (13, 26) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 6) (5, 29) (5, 13) (5, 11) (20, 17) (20, 9) (18, 26) (18, 9) (18, 8) (7, 25) (25, 7) (25, 21) (8, 3) (8, 28) (8, 18) (8, 19) (19, 0) (19, 27) (19, 8) (19, 10) (11, 17) (11, 5) (11, 4) (12, 1) (12, 28) (16, 14) (16, 9) (9, 20) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 2) (6, 15) (6, 13) (2, 15) (2, 9) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 11) (10, 23) (10, 29) (10, 13) (10, 19) (21, 26) (21, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <3, 15, 4, 11>
- Cycle 2: <14, 28, 12, 1>
- Cycle 3: <17, 20, 9, 16>
- Cycle 4: <27, 1, 13, 26>
- Cycle 5: <0, 27, 19, 8>
- Cycle 6: <22, 23, 26, 13>
- Cycle 7: <26, 18, 9, 16>
- Cycle 8: <8, 3, 4, 15>
- Cycle 9: <5, 29, 0, 27>
- Cycle 10: <18, 26, 21, 25>

Step 2:
- Checking for chords:
    - Chordal cycle <3, 15, 4, 11> with chord (3, 4)
    - Chordal cycle <14, 28, 12, 1> with chord (14, 12)
    - Chordal cycle <17, 20, 9, 16> with chord (17, 9)
    - Chordal cycle <27, 1, 13, 26> with chord (27, 13)
    - Chordal cycle <0, 27, 19, 8> with chord (0, 19)

Step 3:
There are a total of [5] chordal 4-cycles found in the graph:
- <3, 15, 4, 11>
- <14, 28, 12, 1>
- <17, 20, 9, 16>
- <27, 1, 13, 26>
- <0, 27, 19, 8>
