Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 6 - 1 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 6 - 9 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 2 - 1 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 8 - 9 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 6 - 1 - 2 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 8 - 5 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 7: 6 - 1 - 5 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 8: 6 - 7 - 2 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 9: 6 - 4 - 0 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 10: 2 - 1 - 6 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 11: 2 - 4 - 0 - 8 - 2
- Cycle 12: 8 - 9 - 6 - 7 - 8
- Cycle 13: 8 - 0 - 6 - 4 - 8
- Cycle 14: 0 - 4 - 6 - 1 - 0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (6, 2)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (5, 1)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (6, 5)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (1, 2)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (2, 8)
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 14 has a chord: (6, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, (6, 2), 1)>
<5, (6, 8), 9)>
<9, (9, 2), 6)>
<6, (6, 5), 8)>
<2, (1, 2), 6)>
<8, (2, 8), 0)>
<0, (6, 4), 8)>
