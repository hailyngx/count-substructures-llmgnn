Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-8-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-9-3-1
- Cycle 4: 1-4-9-0-1
- Cycle 5: 1-4-6-7-1
- Cycle 6: 2-5-8-1-2
- Cycle 7: 2-5-1-6-2
- Cycle 8: 2-5-9-4-2
- Cycle 9: 2-7-4-9-2
- Cycle 10: 2-7-6-1-2
- Cycle 11: 3-9-4-0-3
- Cycle 12: 3-9-0-8-3
- Cycle 13: 4-1-5-2-4
- Cycle 14: 4-1-6-7-4
- Cycle 15: 4-9-5-2-4
- Cycle 16: 4-9-6-7-4
- Cycle 17: 5-1-6-2-5
- Cycle 18: 5-1-4-9-5
- Cycle 19: 6-1-5-2-6
- Cycle 20: 6-1-4-9-6
- Cycle 21: 6-2-5-8-6
- Cycle 22: 6-2-7-4-6
- Cycle 23: 6-7-4-9-6
- Cycle 24: 7-6-1-5-7
- Cycle 25: 7-6-2-5-7
- Cycle 26: 7-4-9-3-7
- Cycle 27: 8-1-5-2-8
- Cycle 28: 8-1-4-9-8
- Cycle 29: 8-5-1-6-8
- Cycle 30: 8-5-2-7-8
- Cycle 31: 9-3-2-5-9
- Cycle 32: 9-3-4-7-9
- Cycle 33: 9-0-4-7-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
<1, (4, 9), 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
