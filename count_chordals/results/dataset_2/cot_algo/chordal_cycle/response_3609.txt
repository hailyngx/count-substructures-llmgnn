Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 3) (11, 0) (16, 1) (16, 18) (16, 4) (3, 11) (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 6) (15, 2) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 5) (2, 15) (2, 9) (2, 7) (18, 16) (18, 9) (8, 19) (8, 6) (19, 8) (19, 10) (19, 6) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 18) (9, 10) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 6) (0, 11) (0, 3) (0, 13) (6, 15) (6, 8) (6, 19) (6, 7) (5, 17) (5, 4) (12, 14) (12, 10) (1, 16) (1, 13) (10, 19) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 4) (13, 0) (13, 1) (13, 4) (4, 16) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (3, 0, 11, 3)
        - Cycle 2: (3, 0, 13, 1, 16, 4, 5, 17, 14, 7, 3)
        - Cycle 3: (3, 7, 2, 15, 6, 8, 19, 10, 12, 14, 7)
        - Cycle 4: (9, 18, 16, 1, 13, 0, 3, 9)
        - Cycle 5: (9, 18, 16, 4, 13, 0, 3, 9)
        - Cycle 6: (9, 18, 16, 4, 5, 17, 14, 7, 2, 9)
        - Cycle 7: (10, 4, 13, 1, 16, 18, 9, 10)
        - Cycle 8: (10, 4, 13, 0, 3, 9, 10, 12)
        - Cycle 9: (10, 4, 16, 1, 13, 0, 3, 10)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - <3, (0, 11), 3>  (Cycle 1 has a chord (0, 11))
        - <3, (0, 13, 1), 16, 4, 5, 17, 14, 7>  (Cycle 2 has a chord (0, 13, 1))
        - <3, 7, (2, 15), 6, 8, 19, 10, 12, 14>  (Cycle 3 has a chord (2, 15))
        - <9, (18, 16), 1, 13, 0, 3>  (Cycle 4 has a chord (18, 16))
        - <9, (18, 16), 4, 13, 0, 3>  (Cycle 5 has a chord (18, 16))
        - <9, (18, 16), 4, 5, 17, 14, 7, 2>  (Cycle 6 has a chord (18, 16))
        - <10, 4, 13, (1, 16), 18, 9>  (Cycle 7 has a chord (1, 16))
        - <10, 4, 13, (0, 3), 9, 12>  (Cycle 8 has a chord (0, 3))
        - <10, (4, 16), 1, 13, 0, 3>  (Cycle 9 has a chord (4, 16))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
