Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 7) (15, 14) (27, 15) (27, 23) (14, 15) (14, 23) (14, 21) (17, 22) (17, 7) (1, 6) (3, 21) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 8) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 11) (25, 20) (25, 26) (25, 6) (25, 12) (4, 8) (4, 21) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 28) (8, 6) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 22) (11, 5) (28, 8) (28, 11) (28, 2) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 26) (5, 16) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 0) (21, 14) (21, 3) (21, 4) (21, 10) (21, 29) (29, 20) (29, 21) (29, 9) (29, 19) (9, 13) (9, 29) (9, 19) (9, 24) (9, 0) (10, 21) (10, 24) (10, 16) (0, 13) (0, 9) (0, 16) (0, 2) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 0) (26, 25) (26, 5) (6, 1) (6, 25) (6, 8) (6, 24) (24, 9) (24, 10) (24, 6) (18, 23) (23, 27) (23, 14) (23, 18) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 2) (19, 29) (19, 9) (22, 17) (22, 11) (12, 25) (2, 28) (2, 0) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (15, 14, 21, 3, 15)
- Cycle 2: (15, 27, 23, 14, 15)
- Cycle 3: (11, 28, 8, 3, 11)
- Cycle 4: (11, 28, 2, 0, 13, 9, 29, 20, 11)
- Cycle 5: (11, 28, 2, 0, 13, 9, 19, 29, 20, 11)
- Cycle 6: (11, 28, 2, 7, 17, 22, 11)
- Cycle 7: (11, 28, 2, 0, 13, 9, 24, 6, 25, 20, 11)
- Cycle 8: (11, 28, 2, 0, 13, 9, 24, 6, 8, 3, 11)
- Cycle 9: (11, 28, 2, 0, 13, 9, 29, 21, 14, 23, 18, 11)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: <15, (14, 21), 3, 15>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: <15, (27, 23), 14, 15>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: <11, (28, 8), 3, 11>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: <11, (28, 2), 0, 13, 9, 29, 20, 11>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: <11, (28, 2), 0, 13, 9, 19, 29, 20, 11>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: <11, (28, 2), 7, 17, 22, 11>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: <11, (28, 2), 0, 13, 9, 24, 6, 25, 20, 11>
- Cycle 8 has one chord: <11, (28, 2), 0, 13, 9, 24, 6, 8, 3, 11>
- Cycle 9 has one chord: <11, (28, 2), 0, 13, 9, 29, 21, 14, 23, 18, 11>

Step 3: Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [9].
