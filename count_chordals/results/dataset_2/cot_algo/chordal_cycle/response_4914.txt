Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 5) (1, 8) (1, 5) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (10, 2) (10, 14) 

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 3 - 13 - 12
- Cycle 2: 6 - 11 - 14 - 10
- Cycle 3: 6 - 8 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 4: 6 - 11 - 2 - 10
- Cycle 5: 6 - 8 - 2 - 11
- Cycle 6: 6 - 3 - 0 - 13
- Cycle 7: 6 - 3 - 5 - 7
- Cycle 8: 6 - 8 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 9: 3 - 0 - 2 - 11
- Cycle 10: 3 - 5 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 11: 11 - 2 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 12: 11 - 14 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 13: 11 - 12 - 13 - 0
- Cycle 14: 7 - 5 - 14 - 10
- Cycle 15: 12 - 0 - 7 - 9

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each of the cycles:
- <6, 3, 13, 12> has a chord (3, 13)
- <6, 11, 14, 10> has a chord (11, 14)
- <6, 8, 4, 2> has a chord (8, 2)
- <6, 11, 2, 10> has a chord (11, 2)
- <6, 8, 2, 11> has a chord (8, 2)
- <6, 3, 0, 13> has a chord (3, 13)
- <6, 3, 5, 7> has a chord (3, 5)
- <6, 8, 1, 5> has a chord (8, 5)
- <3, 0, 2, 11> has a chord (0, 2)
- <3, 5, 7, 2> has a chord (5, 7)
- <11, 2, 7, 5> has a chord (2, 7)
- <11, 14, 5, 0> has a chord (11, 5)
- <11, 12, 13, 0> has a chord (12, 13)
- <7, 5, 14, 10> has a chord (5, 14)
- <12, 0, 7, 9> has a chord (0, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the final count is [15].
