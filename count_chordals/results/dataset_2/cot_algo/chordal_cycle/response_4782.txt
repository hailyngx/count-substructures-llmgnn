Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 14) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 3) (16, 5) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 12) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 4) (10, 2) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 6) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (5, 16) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 0) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (4, 10) (18, 10) (18, 9) (18, 3) (19, 14) (19, 1) (19, 0) (1, 6) (1, 19) (1, 9) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 14) (9, 18) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (15, 11) (12, 17) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) (3, 16) (3, 18) (3, 12) (0, 5) (0, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 8, 10, 2, 7)
- Cycle 2: (5, 6, 8, 7, 9, 12)
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 8, 10, 18, 9)
- Cycle 4: (5, 6, 1, 19, 0, 5)

Step 2:
Among these cycles, only Cycle 2: (5, 6, 8, 7, 9, 12) has exactly one chord, which is (8, 9) connecting non-adjacent nodes 8 and 9.

Step 3:
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<<5, 6, 8, 7, 9, 12>> with the chord (8, 9)
