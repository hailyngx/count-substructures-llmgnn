Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 13) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 10) (2, 14) (2, 1) (2, 13) (9, 0) (9, 11) (9, 10) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 5) (10, 9) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, but for the sake of finding chordal 4-cycles, we are interested in cycles of length 4. These cycles can be found by following the edges in the graph:

1. Cycle: 0-5-8-14-0
2. Cycle: 0-13-4-12-0
3. Cycle: 1-2-14-13-1
4. Cycle: 1-7-3-6-1
5. Cycle: 3-5-10-9-3
6. Cycle: 3-7-1-2-3
7. Cycle: 4-5-8-14-4
8. Cycle: 6-3-0-9-6
9. Cycle: 10-4-12-13-10
10. Cycle: 11-8-14-13-11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord are:

1. Cycle: 0-13-4-12-0
   Chord: <5, 14>
   
2. Cycle: 1-2-14-13-1
   Chord: <7, 3>
   
3. Cycle: 3-5-10-9-3
   Chord: <7, 1>

4. Cycle: 11-8-14-13-11
   Chord: <6, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, which should be represented as [4].
