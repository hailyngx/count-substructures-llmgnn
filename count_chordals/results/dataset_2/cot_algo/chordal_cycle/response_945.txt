Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 29) (13, 18) (22, 26) (22, 17) (15, 0) (15, 25) (15, 14) (27, 14) (27, 10) (27, 2) (2, 27) (2, 29) (2, 10) (29, 13) (29, 2) (29, 0) (3, 25) (3, 26) (3, 8) (25, 15) (25, 3) (25, 20) (25, 16) (25, 4) (4, 25) (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 21) (7, 11) (7, 10) (21, 7) (21, 20) (21, 5) (20, 25) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 6) (19, 6) (19, 23) (26, 22) (26, 3) (26, 0) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 8) (17, 22) (17, 20) (17, 6) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 12) (28, 24) (8, 3) (8, 1) (11, 7) (6, 20) (6, 19) (6, 17) (6, 14) (14, 15) (14, 27) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 28) (9, 14) (9, 24) (9, 12) (0, 15) (0, 29) (0, 26) (5, 21) (5, 1) (23, 19) (23, 24) (10, 27) (10, 2) (10, 4) (10, 7) (16, 25) (16, 18) (24, 28) (24, 9) (24, 23) (18, 13) (18, 16) (12, 28) (12, 9) 

Response:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, (15, 29), 13, 26)>
<4, (25, 9), 14, 6)>
<7, (4, 10), 21, 20)>
