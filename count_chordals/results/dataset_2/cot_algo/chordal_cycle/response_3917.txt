Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-6-5-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-6-3-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-4-1-0
- Cycle 4: 1-4-2-3-1
- Cycle 5: 1-4-9-8-1
- Cycle 6: 2-4-9-8-2
- Cycle 7: 2-4-9-6-2
- Cycle 8: 5-6-9-8-5

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, (3, 6), 2>
2. <1, (2, 4), 9>
3. <1, (2, 3), 4>
4. <2, (6, 9), 4>
5. <5, (6, 9), 8>

Step 3: 
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
