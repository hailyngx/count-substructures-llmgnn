Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 12) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 11) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 2) (12, 10) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 9, 1, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 2, 11, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 9, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle 4: (0, 3, 8, 4, 0)
- Cycle 5: (7, 0, 5, 2, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 8, 3, 1, 7)
- Cycle 7: (9, 11, 4, 7, 9)
- Cycle 8: (11, 4, 8, 13, 11)
- Cycle 9: (13, 4, 7, 0, 13)
- Cycle 10: (2, 5, 0, 12, 2)
- Cycle 11: (12, 0, 7, 4, 12)
- Cycle 12: (12, 6, 13, 4, 12)
- Cycle 13: (8, 14, 13, 6, 8)
- Cycle 14: (10, 5, 9, 1, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- The cycle <0, 5, 9, 1, 0> has a chord: (5, 1)
- The cycle <0, 5, 2, 11, 0> has a chord: (5, 11)
- The cycle <2, 5, 0, 12, 2> has a chord: (5, 12)
- The cycle <10, 5, 9, 1, 10> has a chord: (5, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

From the above analysis, we can see that there are 10 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
