Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 8) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) (14, 4) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 12) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 13) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

- Cycle 1: (4, 8, 9, 7)
- Cycle 2: (4, 8, 10, 2)
- Cycle 3: (4, 1, 14, 12)
- Cycle 4: (7, 9, 6, 0)
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 0, 5)
- Cycle 6: (9, 6, 11, 10)
- Cycle 7: (9, 7, 5, 11)
- Cycle 8: (6, 11, 5, 4)
- Cycle 9: (6, 11, 14, 4)
- Cycle 10: (6, 0, 5, 3)
- Cycle 11: (10, 8, 4, 1)
- Cycle 12: (10, 8, 11, 13)
- Cycle 13: (10, 2, 1, 4)
- Cycle 14: (0, 6, 9, 12)
- Cycle 15: (0, 5, 11, 14)
- Cycle 16: (0, 5, 3, 12)
- Cycle 17: (14, 11, 6, 0)
- Cycle 18: (14, 11, 8, 4)
- Cycle 19: (14, 12, 9, 13)
- Cycle 20: (3, 13, 9, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- The cycle (6, 0, 5, 3) has a chord (6, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles is [19].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, 8, 9, 7>
- <4, 8, 10, 2>
- <4, 1, 14, 12>
- <7, 9, 6, 0>
- <9, 7, 5, 11>
- <6, 11, 5, 4>
- <6, 11, 14, 4>
- <10, 8, 4, 1>
- <10, 8, 11, 13>
- <10, 2, 1, 4>
- <0, 6, 9, 12>
- <0, 5, 11, 14>
- <14, 11, 6, 0>
- <14, 11, 8, 4>
- <14, 12, 9, 13>
- <3, 13, 9, 7>
