Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 14) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 12) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 13) (1, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 14) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 13) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 2) (14, 12) (14, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 13) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 14, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 10, 12, 8, 11, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 11, 7, 2, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (4, 8, 12, 14, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 1, 10, 12, 8, 4)
- Cycle 6: (8, 1, 7, 2, 6, 8)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (9, 14), 4, 5)>
- Cycle 2: <2, (10, 8), 11, 5)>
- Cycle 3: <3, (2, 6), 5, 11)>
- Cycle 4: <4, (8, 12), 14, 4)>
- Cycle 5: <5, (1, 10), 4, 8)>
- Cycle 6: <6, (1, 7), 8, 6)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (9, 14), 4, 5)>
<2, (10, 8), 11, 5)>
<3, (2, 6), 5, 11)>
<4, (8, 12), 14, 4)>
<5, (1, 10), 4, 8)>
<6, (1, 7), 8, 6)>
