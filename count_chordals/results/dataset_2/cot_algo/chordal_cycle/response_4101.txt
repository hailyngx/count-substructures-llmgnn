Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 14) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 10) (11, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 0) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2) (4, 14)

- Cycle <0, 3, 4, 2>
- Cycle <1, 4, 2, 13>
- Cycle <1, 4, 10, 6>
- Cycle <1, 7, 9, 6>
- Cycle <1, 7, 3, 0>
- Cycle <2, 4, 10, 6>
- Cycle <2, 4, 14, 13>
- Cycle <2, 12, 5, 4>
- Cycle <3, 4, 10, 6>
- Cycle <3, 4, 2, 12>
- Cycle <3, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle <5, 12, 2, 13>
- Cycle <5, 12, 0, 3>
- Cycle <6, 10, 4, 1>
- Cycle <6, 10, 11, 13>

- Cycle <6, 11, 10, 4>
- Cycle <7, 1, 4, 10>
- Cycle <7, 1, 0, 3>
- Cycle <9, 13, 2, 12>
- Cycle <9, 13, 14, 11>
- Cycle <9, 13, 11, 6>
- Cycle <9, 14, 8, 11>
- Cycle <9, 14, 13, 2>
- Cycle <10, 6, 0, 5>
- Cycle <11, 14, 13, 9>
- Cycle <11, 14, 4, 1>
- Cycle <13, 2, 12, 5>
- Cycle <13, 2, 4, 1>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<1, (4, 10), 6>

Step 3:
There is [1] unique chordal 4-cycle found.
