Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 1 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 7 - 1 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 8 - 1 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 5 - 1 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 5: 0 - 7 - 1 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 6: 0 - 8 - 1 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 7: 1 - 5 - 3 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 8: 1 - 7 - 3 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 9: 1 - 8 - 3 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 10: 2 - 1 - 7 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 11: 2 - 1 - 8 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 12: 2 - 3 - 1 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 13: 2 - 3 - 1 - 8 - 2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 7 has a chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (1, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord found is <1, 3, 2, 1>, and the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
