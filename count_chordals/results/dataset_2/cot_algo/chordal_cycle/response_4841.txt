- Cycle 27: (0, 6, 4, 9, 0)
- Cycle 28: (0, 6, 7, 8, 0)
- Cycle 29: (0, 1, 5, 2, 0)
- Cycle 30: (0, 1, 9, 6, 0)

- Cycle 39: (4, 6, 0, 1, 4)
- Cycle 40: (4, 3, 7, 9, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <7, (3, 1), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (1, 2), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, (7, 3), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <6, (0, 1), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6, (4, 3), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <7, (3, 1), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (6, 1), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, (0, 4), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <6, (3, 4), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <3, (7, 1), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <6, (1, 0), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <9, (1, 4), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <7, (6, 8), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <1, (3, 2), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <7, (0, 8), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <6, (0, 4), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <1, (5, 2), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <7, (3, 8), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <6, (7, 3), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 20: <4, (9, 8), 7>
