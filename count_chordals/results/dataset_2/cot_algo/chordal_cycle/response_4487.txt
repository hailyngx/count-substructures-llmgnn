Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 24) (2, 25) (29, 25) (0, 27) (0, 14) (0, 19) (27, 0) (27, 6) (22, 4) (22, 25) (22, 3) (23, 8) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 13) (18, 2) (18, 16) (8, 23) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 7) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 24) (21, 9) (21, 19) (28, 11) (28, 26) (11, 28) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 12) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 19) (17, 23) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 5) (26, 28) (26, 16) (10, 13) (15, 23) (15, 12) (15, 4) (20, 24) (4, 22) (4, 1) (4, 15) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 24) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 25) (5, 3) (9, 14) (9, 21) (9, 11) (9, 16) (16, 18) (16, 26) (16, 9) (3, 22) (3, 5) (24, 2) (24, 14) (24, 20) (24, 7) (25, 2) (25, 29) (25, 22) (25, 5) (25, 6) (6, 27) (6, 25) (6, 12) (6, 13) (19, 0) (19, 21) (19, 1) (19, 17) (13, 23) (13, 10) (13, 6) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph, such as:
- Cycle <0, 27, 6, 25, 2, 0> 
- Cycle <4, 22, 25, 5, 3, 22> 
- Cycle <7, 24, 2, 18, 16, 26, 28, 11, 7>
- Cycle <8, 23, 17, 1, 4, 22, 3, 5, 25, 6, 27, 0, 14, 9, 21, 19, 8>

Step 2:
Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 27, 6, 25, 2, 0> does not have a chord.
- Cycle <4, 22, 25, 5, 3, 22> does not have a chord.
- Cycle <7, 24, 2, 18, 16, 26, 28, 11, 7> has a chord 16.
- Cycle <8, 23, 17, 1, 4, 22, 3, 5, 25, 6, 27, 0, 14, 9, 21, 19, 8> has a chord 23.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 2, so the answer is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, 27, 6, 25, 2, 0>
- <4, 22, 25, 5, 3, 22>
