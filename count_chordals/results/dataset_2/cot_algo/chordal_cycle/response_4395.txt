Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 1 - 3 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 4: 9 - 6 - 7 - 3 - 9
- Cycle 5: 9 - 8 - 2 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 6: 6 - 7 - 3 - 4 - 6
- Cycle 7: 1 - 3 - 7 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 8: 3 - 6 - 2 - 4 - 3
- Cycle 9: 4 - 8 - 2 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 10: 5 - 0 - 7 - 0 - 5

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (6, 3), 5>
- Cycle 2: <2, (1, 4), 5>
- Cycle 3: <3, (8, 4), 5>
- Cycle 4: <4, (7, 3), 9>
- Cycle 5: <5, (2, 9), 4>
- Cycle 6: <6, (4, 3), 7>
- Cycle 7: <7, (0, 3), 1>
- Cycle 8: <8, (2, 6), 3>
- Cycle 9: <9, (2, 8), 4>
- Cycle 10: <10, (5, 7), 0>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is 10.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
