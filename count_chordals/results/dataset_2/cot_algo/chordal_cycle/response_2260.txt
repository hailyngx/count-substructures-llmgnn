Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 1) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 8) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 14) (12, 13) (12, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 3) (3, 0) (3, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 10) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
There are multiple cycles in the graph, but we will focus on cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 13 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 2: 10 - 11 - 8 - 2 - 10
- Cycle 3: 7 - 13 - 12 - 9 - 7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
Out of the cycles listed above, only Cycle 1 (4 - 7 - 13 - 8 - 4) has exactly one chord - the edge connecting nodes 7 and 8.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Since only Cycle 1 has exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

List of unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <4, 7, 13, 8>
