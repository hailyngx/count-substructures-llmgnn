Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 11) (4, 2) (4, 16) (18, 9) (18, 5) (18, 6) (13, 17) (13, 12) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (17, 13) (7, 3) (7, 16) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 7) (16, 19) (9, 3) (9, 18) (9, 13) (9, 0) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 15) (5, 8) (5, 18) (0, 9) (0, 15) (0, 19) (15, 11) (15, 0) (15, 6) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 6) (6, 18) (6, 13) (6, 15) (6, 12) (10, 2) (10, 13) (10, 19) (14, 1) (14, 19) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 10) (19, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <1, 11, 15, 0, 1>
- <1, 14, 19, 10, 13, 6, 15, 11, 1>
- <3, 7, 16, 19, 14, 1, 11, 12, 6, 15, 0, 9, 3>
- <3, 9, 13, 12, 6, 18, 5, 8, 11, 1, 14, 19, 10, 2, 4, 16, 7, 3>
- <16, 2, 4, 16>
- <16, 19, 0, 15, 6, 13, 17, 12, 11, 15, 0, 9, 13, 10, 2, 16>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, 14, 19, 10, 13, 6, 15, 11, 1> with chords (19, 10)
- <3, 9, 13, 12, 6, 18, 5, 8, 11, 1, 14, 19, 10, 2, 4, 16, 7, 3> with chords (13, 18)
- <16, 19, 0, 15, 6, 13, 17, 12, 11, 15, 0, 9, 13, 10, 2, 16> with chords (16, 0) and (13, 10)

Step 3:
There are [3] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
