Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 19) (3, 6) (3, 15) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 16) (15, 18) (15, 8) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 1) (10, 16) (17, 10) (17, 13) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 19) (19, 6) (19, 12) (16, 15) (16, 10) (16, 1) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 12) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 7) (1, 16) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 2) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 11) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 4) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 11) (18, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <1, 10, 17, 13>
2. <1, 10, 16, 15>
3. <1, 16, 15, 8>
4. <1, 16, 15, 3>
5. <1, 16, 10, 17>
6. <1, 7, 13, 12>
7. <2, 0, 10, 17>
8. <2, 0, 9, 12>
9. <2, 11, 14, 6>
10. <2, 11, 8, 3>
11. <3, 6, 14, 11>
12. <3, 8, 11, 2>
13. <3, 8, 11, 4>
14. <3, 8, 15, 16>
15. <4, 2, 0, 9>
16. <5, 9, 12, 7>
17. <5, 14, 11, 2>
18. <6, 14, 11, 2>
19. <6, 14, 11, 8>
20. <7, 1, 16, 10>
21. <7, 12, 9, 5>
22. <8, 3, 6, 14>
23. <8, 11, 14, 6>
24. <8, 11, 2, 0>
25. <9, 5, 14, 6>
26. <9, 12, 7, 13>
27. <10, 0, 2, 11>
28. <11, 2, 4, 11>
29. <12, 7, 1, 16>
30. <12, 9, 5, 14>
31. <13, 7, 1, 16>
32. <13, 17, 10, 0>
33. <14, 5, 9, 12>
34. <14, 6, 3, 8>
35. <15, 3, 8, 11>
36. <15, 16, 10, 0>
37. <16, 1, 7, 13>
38. <17, 10, 0, 2>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, 10, 16, 15> has one chord (10, 15)
- <1, 16, 15, 8> has one chord (16, 15)
- <1, 16, 15, 3> has one chord (16, 15)
- <1, 16, 10, 17> has one chord (16, 17)
- <2, 0, 10, 17> has one chord (0, 17)
- <2, 11, 14, 6> has one chord (11, 14)
- <7, 1, 16, 10> has one chord (1, 16)
- <5, 9, 12, 7> has one chord (9, 12)
- <6, 14, 11, 2> has one chord (11, 14)
- <8, 3, 6, 14> has one chord (3, 6)
- <9, 12, 7, 13> has one chord (12, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [11]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are as follows:
<1, 10, 16, 15>
<2, 0, 10, 17>
<7, 1, 16, 10>
<5, 9, 12, 7>
<6, 14, 11, 2>
<8, 3, 6, 14>
<9, 12, 7, 13>
