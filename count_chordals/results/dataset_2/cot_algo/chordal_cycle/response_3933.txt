Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (15, 3) (15, 12) (15, 4) (15, 2) (6, 9) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 19) (4, 15) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 13) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 5) (18, 19) (18, 5) (19, 11) (19, 0) (19, 18) (19, 17) (12, 15) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 16) (16, 12) (16, 17) (16, 13) (17, 3) (17, 19) (17, 16) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 18) (7, 10) (7, 2) (13, 14) (13, 16) (2, 15) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 9-6-12-15-9
- Cycle 2: 10-11-9-1-10
- Cycle 3: 14-13-16-17-14

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 6-15
- Cycle 2 has a chord 9-1
- Cycle 3 has a chord 13-16

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<9, (6, 15), 12>
<10, (9, 1), 11>
<14, (13, 16), 17>
