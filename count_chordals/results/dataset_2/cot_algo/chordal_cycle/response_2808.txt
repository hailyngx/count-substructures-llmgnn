Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are four cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
1. Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 4 - 7 - 5
2. Cycle 2: 5 - 8 - 9 - 4 - 5
3. Cycle 3: 5 - 7 - 4 - 8 - 5
4. Cycle 4: 2 - 6 - 7 - 4 - 2

Step 2: 
- Identifying the unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<1, (9, 4), 7)>
<2, (5, 4), 8)>
<3, (5, 8), 4)>
<4, (6, 7), 2)>

Step 3: 
- Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
