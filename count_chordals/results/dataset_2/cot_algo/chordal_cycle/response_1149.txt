Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-3-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-4-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-2-1
- Cycle 5: 1-3-8-1
- Cycle 6: 3-5-8-3
- Cycle 7: 3-5-4-3
- Cycle 8: 3-8-5-3
- Cycle 9: 4-5-8-4
- Cycle 10: 0-4-8-0
- Cycle 11: 0-4-1-0
- Cycle 12: 0-2-7-0

Step 2:
Among these cycles, we need to check for cycles with exactly one chord. 

The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (5, 3), 1>
- <1, (5, 4), 1>
- <1, (3, 2), 1>
- <3, (5, 8), 3>
- <3, (5, 4), 3>
- <3, (8, 5), 3>
- <4, (5, 8), 4>
- <0, (4, 8), 0>
- <0, (4, 1), 0>
- <0, (2, 7), 0>

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5, 3), 1>
- <1, (5, 4), 1>
- <1, (3, 2), 1>
