Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 28) (11, 9) (11, 8) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 10) (13, 22) (13, 21) (13, 15) (13, 0) (22, 13) (22, 23) (22, 27) (22, 8) (15, 13) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 25) (27, 22) (27, 12) (27, 14) (14, 27) (14, 17) (14, 2) (17, 16) (17, 14) (17, 21) (23, 22) (23, 1) (3, 0) (25, 15) (25, 5) (25, 18) (12, 27) (12, 29) (12, 19) (2, 14) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 25) (18, 2) (18, 4) (28, 11) (28, 29) (28, 8) (28, 19) (29, 12) (29, 28) (29, 9) (29, 7) (4, 16) (4, 18) (4, 5) (4, 21) (24, 26) (26, 24) (26, 6) (20, 8) (20, 6) (9, 11) (9, 29) (9, 19) (10, 16) (10, 0) (21, 13) (21, 17) (21, 4) (5, 25) (5, 2) (5, 4) (0, 13) (0, 15) (0, 3) (0, 10) (8, 11) (8, 22) (8, 28) (8, 20) (7, 2) (7, 29) (1, 23) (19, 12) (19, 2) (19, 28) (19, 9) (6, 26) (6, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 13-22-27-14-13
- Cycle 2: 15-25-18-2-15
- Cycle 3: 4-16-17-14-4
- Cycle 4: 5-25-18-4-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 has two chords: (22, 14)
- Cycle 2 has two chords: (25, 2)
- Cycle 3 has two chords: (16, 14)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (25, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There is one unique chordal 4-cycle found, which is <13, (22, 14), 27, 14, 13>, and the total count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
