Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 19) (10, 0) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 1) (11, 2) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 19) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 18) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 9) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 15) (14, 13) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 18) (15, 14) (15, 16) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 18) (17, 6) (17, 18) (16, 7) (16, 15) (16, 9) (16, 5) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 19) (12, 2) (12, 19) (12, 9) (6, 17) (5, 10) (5, 4) (5, 16) (19, 3) (19, 4) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 12) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 16) (9, 12) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 13) (18, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 11, 2, 12) with edges (1, 11), (11, 2), (2, 12), (12, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 11, 2, 19) with edges (1, 11), (11, 2), (2, 19), (19, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 11, 2, 12, 9) with edges (1, 11), (11, 2), (2, 12), (12, 9), (9, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 14, 15, 16) with edges (3, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 14, 15, 16, 5) with edges (3, 14), (14, 15), (15, 16), (16, 5), (5, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (14, 16).
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (14, 16).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are no chordal 4-cycles found in this graph since all cycles of length 4 or more have at least one chord.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
