Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 4) (14, 10) (14, 6) (14, 4) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 13) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 1) (8, 7) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 2) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
1. Cycle: (3, 5, 7, 9, 10)
2. Cycle: (3, 5, 7, 8, 11)
3. Cycle: (3, 6, 10, 12, 9)
4. Cycle: (1, 2, 13, 11, 8)
5. Cycle: (1, 2, 13, 3, 6)
6. Cycle: (4, 2, 13, 3, 5)
7. Cycle: (4, 2, 13, 11, 8)
8. Cycle: (4, 5, 3, 6, 10)
9. Cycle: (4, 5, 3, 7, 8)
10. Cycle: (4, 6, 10, 14, 2)
11. Cycle: (4, 6, 10, 12, 11)
12. Cycle: (6, 3, 7, 8, 11)
13. Cycle: (6, 3, 7, 9, 10)
14. Cycle: (6, 4, 5, 3, 7)
15. Cycle: (6, 4, 5, 6, 14)

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<1, (11, 8), 2>

Step 3:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
