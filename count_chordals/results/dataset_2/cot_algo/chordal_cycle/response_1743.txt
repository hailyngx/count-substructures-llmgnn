Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 8) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 0) (6, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 13) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 14) (5, 10) (5, 0) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 10) (14, 8) (14, 1) (14, 2) (14, 3) (13, 11) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-8-4-0 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 2: 0-1-13-7-0 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 3: 0-4-8-1-0 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 4: 0-9-2-7-0 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 5: 1-8-14-2-1 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 6: 1-13-7-9-1 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 7: 2-7-13-11-2 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 8: 3-7-13-0-3 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 9: 4-8-12-3-4 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 10: 5-0-4-9-5 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 11: 10-5-0-13-10 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 12: 11-2-9-13-11 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 13: 12-4-8-14-12 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 14: 13-0-4-8-13 (chordless cycle of length 4)
- Cycle 15: 14-2-7-13-14 (chordless cycle of length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, (1, 8), 4, 0> has one chord (1, 8)
- <0, (1, 13), 7, 0> has one chord (1, 13)
- <0, (4, 8), 1, 0> has one chord (4, 8)
- <0, (2, 7), 9, 0> has one chord (2, 7)
- <1, (8, 14), 2, 1> has one chord (8, 14)
- <1, (7, 13), 9, 1> has one chord (7, 13)
- <2, (7, 13), 11, 2> has one chord (7, 13)
- <3, (7, 13), 0, 3> has one chord (7, 13)
- <4, (8, 12), 3, 4> has one chord (8, 12)
- <5, (0, 4), 9, 5> has one chord (0, 4)
- <10, (5, 0), 13, 10> has one chord (5, 0)
- <11, (2, 9), 13, 11> has one chord (2, 9)
- <12, (4, 8), 14, 12> has one chord (4, 8)
- <13, (0, 4), 8, 13> has one chord (0, 4)
- <14, (2, 7), 13, 14> has one chord (2, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
