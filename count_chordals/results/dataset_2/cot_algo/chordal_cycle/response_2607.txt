Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (9, 5, 6, 9) 
- Cycle 2: (9, 6, 4, 9) 
- Cycle 3: (4, 6, 7, 4)  
- Cycle 4: (6, 7, 2, 6)  
- Cycle 5: (7, 2, 8, 7)  
- Cycle 6: (2, 8, 1, 2)  
- Cycle 7: (8, 1, 6, 8)  
- Cycle 8: (1, 6, 0, 1)  
- Cycle 9: (6, 9, 5, 6)  
- Cycle 10: (9, 2, 5, 9)  
- Cycle 11: (2, 5, 3, 2)  
- Cycle 12: (5, 3, 0, 5)  
- Cycle 13: (3, 0, 4, 3)  
- Cycle 14: (0, 4, 6, 0)  
- Cycle 15: (4, 7, 6, 4)  
- Cycle 16: (7, 8, 2, 7)  
- Cycle 17: (8, 5, 9, 8)  
- Cycle 18: (7, 4, 9, 7) 
- Cycle 19: (6, 5, 2, 6) 
- Cycle 20: (4, 0, 1, 4)  
- Cycle 21: (0, 1, 6, 0)  
- Cycle 22: (1, 8, 2, 1)  

Step 2: 
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the chordal 4-cycle: 
- <9, 5, 6, 9> with the chord (9, 6)

Step 3: 
- The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].
