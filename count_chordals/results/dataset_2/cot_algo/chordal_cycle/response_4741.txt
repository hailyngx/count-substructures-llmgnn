Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 10) (16, 6) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 8) (15, 19) (15, 17) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 5) (17, 15) (17, 14) (17, 8) (17, 2) (5, 14) (9, 4) (2, 17) (2, 12) (18, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 0) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 17) (8, 7) (1, 10) (1, 13) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 19) (19, 15) (19, 0) (19, 4) (4, 3) (4, 9) (4, 19) (4, 10) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 6) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 13) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3-10-1-13-3
- Cycle 2: 3-10-4-9-3
- Cycle 3: 13-1-10-16-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (10, 13), 3>
- Cycle 2: <3, (4, 9), 10>
- Cycle 3: <16, (10, 13), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (10, 13), 3>
- <3, (4, 9), 10>
- <16, (10, 13), 1>
