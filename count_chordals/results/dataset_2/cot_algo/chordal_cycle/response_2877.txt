Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles in the graph with length 4 or more:
1. Cycle 1: 0-4-6-2-0
2. Cycle 2: 1-4-6-2-1
3. Cycle 3: 2-6-9-3-2
4. Cycle 4: 3-9-8-7-0-3
5. Cycle 5: 3-9-8-7-5-3

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 1 has chord (4, 2)
2. Cycle 2 has chord (4, 6)
3. Cycle 3 has chord (6, 2)
4. Cycle 4 has chord (9, 7)
5. Cycle 5 has chord (9, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have [5].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (2, 4), 0>
<2, (4, 6), 1>
<3, (6, 2), 2>
<4, (9, 7), 3>
<5, (9, 8), 3>
