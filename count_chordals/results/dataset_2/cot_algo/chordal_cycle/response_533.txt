26. (5, 13, 1, 16) 
27. (5, 4, 11, 16) 
28. (13, 1, 16, 11) 
29. (13, 5, 18, 16) 
30. (7, 5, 18, 16)

Step 2:
Identifying the cycles with exactly one chord:
1. <11, 16, 1, 3> (chord: 16-1)
2. <11, 16, 18, 2> (chord: 16-18)
3. <16, 1, 0, 5> (chord: 1-5)
4. <16, 3, 15, 9> (chord: 3-15)
5. <16, 19, 4, 11> (chord: 19-4)
   
Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph, so the final count is [5].
