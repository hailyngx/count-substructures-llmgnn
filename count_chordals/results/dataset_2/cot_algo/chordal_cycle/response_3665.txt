Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 2) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 12) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 1) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 11) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 1) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 2) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 12) (13, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 14) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (10, 5, 11, 7) 
- Cycle 2: (10, 5, 1, 4) 
- Cycle 3: (10, 2, 7, 12) 
- Cycle 4: (10, 9, 13, 4) 
- Cycle 5: (11, 9, 13, 4) 
- Cycle 6: (11, 7, 12, 8) 
- Cycle 7: (4, 13, 11, 5) 
- Cycle 8: (4, 0, 6, 12) 
- Cycle 9: (4, 1, 5, 10) 
- Cycle 10: (8, 14, 4, 13) 
- Cycle 11: (8, 7, 12, 6) 
- Cycle 12: (5, 1, 0, 4) 
- Cycle 13: (6, 0, 4, 13) 
- Cycle 14: (7, 11, 13, 4) 
- Cycle 15: (7, 12, 6, 0) 
- Cycle 16: (12, 8, 14, 4) 
- Cycle 17: (0, 4, 1, 5) 
- Cycle 18: (3, 10, 5, 1) 
- Cycle 19: (3, 12, 6, 0) 
- Cycle 20: (14, 4, 1, 5) 
- Cycle 21: (13, 9, 10, 5) 
- Cycle 22: (1, 5, 11, 7) 
- Cycle 23: (2, 10, 9, 13) 

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:

- The chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: <1, (5, 10), 4> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- Number of chordless cycles: [0]
