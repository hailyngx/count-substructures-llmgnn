Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 12) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 4) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 4) (13, 6) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 14) (4, 3) (4, 11) (4, 0) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 1) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 4) (10, 9) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 12) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 7) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 14) (7, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 2-5-6-13-2
- Cycle 2: 3-2-5-6-13-3
- Cycle 3: 4-3-2-5-6-13-4
- Cycle 4: 8-12-6-5-2-11-8
- Cycle 5: 1-9-10-13-6-12-1
- Cycle 6: 7-8-12-6-5-13-14-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

I have found the following unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <2, 5, 6, 13> with chord (2, 13)
- <3, 2, 5, 6> with chord (3, 6)
- <4, 3, 2, 5> with chord (4, 5)
- <8, 12, 6, 5> with chord (8, 5)
- <1, 9, 10, 13> with chord (1, 13)
- <7, 8, 12, 6> with chord (7, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles found.

Final answer: [6]
