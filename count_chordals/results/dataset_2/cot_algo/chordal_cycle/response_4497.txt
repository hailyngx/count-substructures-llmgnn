Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 13) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 1) (0, 12) (0, 3) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 11) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 3) (11, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (1, 12) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 10) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: 5-9-8-6-5
        - Cycle 2: 9-8-13-7-9
        - Cycle 3: 8-13-3-14-8
        - Cycle 4: 13-7-11-2-13
        - Cycle 5: 7-11-4-10-7
        - Cycle 6: 11-2-5-4-11
        - Cycle 7: 10-7-14-1-10
        - Cycle 8: 2-5-4-1-2
        - Cycle 9: 5-4-11-7-5
        - Cycle 10: 4-11-2-9-4
        - Cycle 11: 11-4-10-12-11
        - Cycle 12: 1-14-3-8-1

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - In Cycle 1: <9, 8>
        - In Cycle 2: <8, 7>
        - In Cycle 3: <13, 14>
        - In Cycle 4: <13, 2>
        - In Cycle 5: <7, 10>
        - In Cycle 6: <11, 5>
        - In Cycle 7: <7, 14>
        - In Cycle 8: <5, 1>
        - In Cycle 9: <5, 11>
        - In Cycle 10: <11, 9>
        - In Cycle 11: <10, 12>
        - In Cycle 12: <3, 8>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        As there are 12 cycles with exactly one chord, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
