Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 13) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 10) (10, 13) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 10) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 10) (1, 0) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 12) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 3) (12, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 0, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 0, 5, 14, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 5, 0, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 5, 14, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 7, 5, 12, 6, 2, 8, 1, 10, 13, 9, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 7, 5, 12, 6, 2, 8, 1, 10, 13, 11, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (2, 6), 11, 13, 4> has only one chord (2, 6)
- <1, 5, (0, 2), 14, 4> has only one chord (0, 2)
- <1, 5, (0, 7), 14, 4> has only one chord (0, 7)
- <1, 10, (2, 8), 7, 4> has only one chord (2, 8)
- <1, 8, (2, 6), 7, 4> has only one chord (2, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [5].
