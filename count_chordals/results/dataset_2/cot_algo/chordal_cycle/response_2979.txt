Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 21) (11, 15) (11, 25) (16, 19) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 24) (3, 6) (3, 18) (15, 11) (15, 3) (15, 26) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 23) (6, 12) (6, 27) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 27) (0, 3) (0, 27) (0, 19) (27, 6) (27, 9) (27, 0) (20, 1) (20, 23) (25, 11) (25, 7) (25, 14) (25, 10) (22, 23) (22, 14) (22, 1) (23, 6) (23, 20) (23, 22) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 29) (7, 25) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (17, 5) (17, 2) (29, 4) (29, 19) (21, 11) (21, 28) (21, 14) (28, 21) (28, 8) (28, 18) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 29) (19, 26) (26, 15) (26, 19) (26, 24) (26, 2) (24, 3) (24, 26) (24, 8) (24, 14) (2, 17) (2, 26) (2, 13) (8, 7) (8, 28) (8, 24) (1, 20) (1, 22) (1, 7) (10, 25) (10, 13) (12, 6) (5, 17) (14, 25) (14, 22) (14, 4) (14, 21) (14, 24) (13, 2) (13, 10) (18, 3) (18, 28) 

Response:

- Cycle 4: (3, 6, 23, 22)
- Cycle 5: (3, 18, 28, 8)
- Cycle 6: (3, 18, 28, 21)
- Cycle 7: (15, 11, 21, 14)
- Cycle 8: (15, 26, 2, 17)
- Cycle 9: (15, 26, 24, 8)

- Cycle 12: (6, 23, 20, 1)
- Cycle 13: (6, 12, 27, 0)
- Cycle 14: (9, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 15: (9, 27, 0, 19)
- Cycle 16: (0, 3, 6, 23)
- Cycle 17: (0, 27, 6, 12)

- Cycle 19: (20, 1, 7, 25)
- Cycle 20: (25, 11, 21, 28)
- Cycle 21: (25, 11, 15, 26)
- Cycle 22: (25, 7, 1, 22)
- Cycle 23: (29, 4, 14, 24)
- Cycle 24: (21, 11, 15, 3)
- Cycle 25: (21, 28, 8, 24)
- Cycle 26: (22, 23, 6, 3)
- Cycle 27: (22, 14, 25, 7)
- Cycle 28: (24, 26, 15, 3)
- Cycle 29: (8, 24, 14, 25)
- Cycle 30: (1, 7, 25, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, 15, 11, 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, 15, 26, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, 6, 9, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, 6, 23, 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, 18, 28, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <15, 26, 2, 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6, 9, 4, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, 23, 22, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, 4, 7, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <20, 1, 7, 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <25, 11, 21, 28>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <29, 4, 14, 24>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <21, 11, 15, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <25, 7, 1, 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <8, 24, 14, 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <1, 7, 25, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [16].
