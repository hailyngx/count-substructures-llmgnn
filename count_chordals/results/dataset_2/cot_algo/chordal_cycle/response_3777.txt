The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 25) (26, 9) (26, 21) (11, 16) (11, 24) (11, 19) (16, 11) (16, 2) (16, 6) (16, 14) (6, 16) (6, 13) (14, 16) (14, 17) (14, 5) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 10) (17, 25) (17, 4) (10, 17) (10, 2) (10, 24) (2, 16) (2, 10) (2, 18) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 28) (7, 12) (7, 23) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 20) (12, 15) (21, 26) (21, 14) (21, 28) (28, 18) (28, 21) (28, 19) (28, 23) (22, 5) (22, 29) (22, 8) (24, 11) (24, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 0) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 1) (15, 29) (4, 17) (4, 12) (4, 3) (25, 9) (25, 17) (25, 8) (25, 29) (25, 0) (5, 14) (5, 22) (5, 23) (5, 29) (23, 7) (23, 28) (23, 5) (23, 20) (19, 11) (19, 28) (19, 13) (0, 1) (0, 25) (20, 12) (20, 23) (29, 22) (29, 15) (29, 25) (29, 5) (8, 22) (8, 3) (8, 25) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (9, 26, 21, 14)
- Cycle 2: (11, 16, 2, 10)
- Cycle 3: (16, 14, 17, 10)
- Cycle 4: (16, 6, 13, 1)
- Cycle 5: (21, 14, 17, 10)
- Cycle 6: (21, 26, 9, 25)
- Cycle 7: (28, 18, 2, 16)
- Cycle 8: (28, 21, 14, 5)
- Cycle 9: (28, 23, 5, 14)
- Cycle 10: (28, 19, 11, 16)
- Cycle 11: (5, 14, 16, 2)
- Cycle 12: (5, 29, 15, 1)
- Cycle 13: (5, 22, 29, 15)
- Cycle 14: (5, 23, 7, 12)
- Cycle 15: (2, 10, 24, 11)
- Cycle 16: (2, 18, 15, 1)
- Cycle 17: (17, 10, 24, 11)
- Cycle 18: (17, 25, 29, 5)
- Cycle 19: (17, 4, 3, 8)
- Cycle 20: (10, 17, 25, 8)
- Cycle 21: (10, 24, 11, 19)
- Cycle 22: (12, 7, 23, 28)
- Cycle 23: (12, 15, 29, 5)
- Cycle 24: (12, 4, 3, 8)
- Cycle 25: (14, 16, 2, 18)
- Cycle 26: (14, 17, 10, 24)
- Cycle 27: (14, 21, 26, 9)
- Cycle 28: (15, 18, 28, 23)
- Cycle 29: (15, 1, 0, 25)
- Cycle 30: (15, 29, 22, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (16, 6), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (10, 24), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <10, (11, 19), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <14, (5, 23), 28>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <15, (18, 2), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <17, (10, 24), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <21, (14, 5), 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <23, (7, 12), 28>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <28, (18, 2), 23>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <29, (15, 1), 22>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
