Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 12) (15, 7) (15, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 15) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (7, 15) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 18) (12, 3) (12, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (18, 7) (18, 11) (18, 17) (1, 17) (1, 19) (17, 9) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 18) (11, 2) (5, 4) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 0) (19, 1) (19, 5) (19, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 10) (10, 8) (10, 0) (16, 9) (14, 6) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3-2-13-15-7-12-3
- Cycle 2: 6-9-17-1-19-5-4-13-8-6
- Cycle 3: 8-13-15-7-11-18-17-5-0-10-8
- Cycle 4: 9-6-8-13-4-5-17-1-19-0-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has the chord (2, 13)
- Cycle 2 has the chord (17, 19)
- Cycle 3 has the chord (13, 7)
- Cycle 4 has the chord (8, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <3, (2, 13), 15, 7>
Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (17, 19), 5, 4>
Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <8, (13, 7), 11, 18>
Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <9, (8, 4), 17, 1>
