Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-5-8-4
- Cycle 2: 4-8-6-5-4
- Cycle 3: 4-1-6-5-4
- Cycle 4: 7-9-1-4-7
- Cycle 5: 7-5-8-0-7
- Cycle 6: 8-0-3-9-8
- Cycle 7: 6-3-0-2-6
- Cycle 8: 2-5-6-1-2
- Cycle 9: 1-9-3-0-1
- Cycle 10: 9-7-5-6-9

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-5-8-4 has one chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 2: 4-8-6-5-4 has one chord: (6, 5)
- Cycle 4: 7-9-1-4-7 has one chord: (1, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<4, 7, (5, 8), 8>
<4, 8, (6, 5), 5>
<7, 9, (1, 9), 4>
