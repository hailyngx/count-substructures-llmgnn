Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. Cycle 1-5-9-6-1
2. Cycle 1-5-9-2-1
3. Cycle 1-5-2-7-1
4. Cycle 1-7-2-9-1
5. Cycle 3-5-2-7-3
6. Cycle 3-4-5-2-3
7. Cycle 3-4-0-9-3
8. Cycle 3-7-2-8-3
9. Cycle 4-5-9-0-4
10. Cycle 6-9-2-8-6
11. Cycle 6-8-0-4-6
12. Cycle 7-1-5-3-7
13. Cycle 7-2-9-0-7
14. Cycle 8-6-9-2-8
15. Cycle 8-2-7-3-8

Step 2: 
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <1, 5, 9, (2, 6), 1>
2. <1, 5, 9, (2, 1), 7>
3. <3, 5, 2, (7, 3), 3>
4. <3, 4, 5, (2, 3, 4)>
5. <3, 4, 0, (9, 3), 4>
6. <6, 9, 2, (8, 6), 6>
7. <6, 8, 0, (4, 6), 6>
8. <7, 1, 5, (3, 7), 1>
9. <7, 2, 9, (0, 7), 7>
10. <8, 6, 9, (2, 8), 8>
11. <8, 2, 7, (3, 8), 8>

Step 3: 
The number of chordless cycles found = 15 - 11 = 4

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
