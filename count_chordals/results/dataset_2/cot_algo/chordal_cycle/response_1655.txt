Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 2) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 7) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 7) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 11) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 7) (10, 14) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 10) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 6, 2, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 8, 9, 6, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 10, 7, 4)
- Cycle 4: (2, 11, 3, 4, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 11, 12, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 14, 9, 6, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 14, 10, 7, 2)
- Cycle 8: (3, 8, 14, 13, 3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 11, 2, 6, 3)
- Cycle 10: (3, 11, 12, 1, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 7, 10, 14, 3)
- Cycle 12: (11, 2, 14, 13, 11)
- Cycle 13: (11, 12, 1, 2, 11)
- Cycle 14: (7, 10, 14, 13, 7)
- Cycle 15: (1, 4, 8, 10, 1)
- Cycle 16: (1, 11, 3, 4, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 6), 2> with chord (4, 6)
- <2, (11, 3), 4> with chord (11, 3)
- <3, (2, 6), 4> with chord (2, 6)
- <4, (8, 10), 7> with chord (8, 10)
- <5, (2, 14), 9> with chord (2, 14)
- <6, (3, 13), 8> with chord (3, 13)
- <7, (1, 11), 12> with chord (1, 11)
- <8, (7, 13), 14> with chord (7, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].
