This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 24) (11, 17) (16, 14) (16, 27) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 25) (7, 28) (7, 26) (21, 7) (21, 3) (21, 29) (1, 3) (1, 26) (1, 4) (3, 21) (3, 1) (3, 29) (8, 13) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 27) (26, 7) (26, 1) (26, 12) (2, 15) (2, 25) (4, 1) (4, 18) (4, 12) (18, 4) (18, 10) (18, 28) (18, 25) (17, 11) (17, 20) (0, 7) (0, 24) (0, 19) (0, 6) (25, 7) (25, 2) (25, 18) (25, 19) (23, 27) (23, 10) (20, 17) (20, 22) (20, 14) (20, 28) (12, 26) (12, 4) (12, 10) (5, 24) (19, 0) (19, 25) (19, 29) (19, 9) (24, 11) (24, 0) (24, 5) (6, 0) (6, 15) (14, 16) (14, 20) (14, 9) (29, 21) (29, 3) (29, 19) (29, 15) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 12) (10, 22) (27, 16) (27, 13) (27, 23) (27, 28) (9, 19) (9, 14) (28, 7) (28, 18) (28, 20) (28, 27) (15, 13) (15, 2) (15, 6) (15, 29) (22, 20) (22, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: {7, 21, 3, 1}
- Cycle 2: {7, 26, 1, 4}
- Cycle 3: {18, 25, 2, 15}
- Cycle 4: {26, 12, 4, 18}
- Cycle 5: {0, 24, 5, 19}
- Cycle 6: {10, 23, 27, 16}
- Cycle 7: {14, 20, 28, 27}
- Cycle 8: {10, 22, 20, 17}
- Cycle 9: {15, 2, 25, 18}
- Cycle 10: {15, 6, 0, 24}
- Cycle 11: {3, 29, 15, 2}
- Cycle 12: {21, 29, 15, 3}
- Cycle 13: {7, 25, 18, 4}

Step 2:

Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has a chord {21, 1}: <7, 21, (21, 1), 3>
- Cycle 2 has a chord {26, 4}: <7, 26, (26, 4), 1>
- Cycle 3 has a chord {25, 15}: <18, 25, (25, 15), 2>
- Cycle 4 has a chord {12, 18}: <26, 12, (12, 18), 4>
- Cycle 5 has a chord {24, 5}: <0, 24, (24, 5), 19>
- Cycle 9 has a chord {2, 18}: <15, 2, (2, 18), 25>

Step 3:

Counting the chordal 4-cycles:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the given graph is [6].
