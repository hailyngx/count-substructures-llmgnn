Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 9, 1, 4, 7, 6> with edges (0, 9), (9, 1), (1, 4), (4, 7), (7, 6), (6, 7).
2. Cycle <1, 9, 0, 7, 5, 3> with edges (1, 9), (9, 0), (0, 7), (7, 5), (5, 3), (3, 1).
3. Cycle <2, 9, 1, 4, 7, 5> with edges (2, 9), (9, 1), (1, 4), (4, 7), (7, 5), (5, 2).
4. Cycle <3, 1, 9, 0, 7, 5> with edges (3, 1), (1, 9), (9, 0), (0, 7), (7, 5), (5, 3).
5. Cycle <4, 9, 1, 7, 5, 2> with edges (4, 9), (9, 1), (1, 7), (7, 5), (5, 2), (2, 4).
6. Cycle <5, 7, 4, 9, 0, 2> with edges (5, 7), (7, 4), (4, 9), (9, 0), (0, 2), (2, 5).
7. Cycle <6, 7, 4, 9, 1, 2> with edges (6, 7), (7, 4), (4, 9), (9, 1), (1, 2), (2, 6).
8. Cycle <8, 9, 0, 7, 5, 3> with edges (8, 9), (9, 0), (0, 7), (7, 5), (5, 3), (3, 8).

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. <0, 9, 1, 4, 7, 6> has chord (1, 4).
2. <1, 9, 0, 7, 5, 3> has chord (0, 7).
3. <2, 9, 1, 4, 7, 5> has chord (1, 5).
4. <3, 1, 9, 0, 7, 5> has chord (1, 5).
5. <4, 9, 1, 7, 5, 2> has chord (1, 5).
6. <5, 7, 4, 9, 0, 2> has chord (4, 9).
7. <6, 7, 4, 9, 1, 2> has chord (1, 9).
8. <8, 9, 0, 7, 5, 3> has chord (0, 7).

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [8].
