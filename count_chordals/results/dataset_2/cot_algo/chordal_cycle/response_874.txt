Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4)

        - Cycle 22: 2-8-5-4-2
        - Cycle 23: 8-5-6-7-8
        - Cycle 24: 8-1-3-0-8
        - Cycle 25: 8-7-6-5-8
        - Cycle 26: 0-1-7-6-0
        - Cycle 27: 0-3-9-2-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Cycle 1: <5, (4, 1), 3>
        - Cycle 2: <5, (7, 1), 6>
        - Cycle 3: <5, (9, 6), 2>
        - Cycle 4: <5, (7, 1), 8>
        - Cycle 5: <3, (7, 6), 1>
        - Cycle 6: <3, (5, 0), 4>
        - Cycle 7: <3, (9, 6), 2>
        - Cycle 8: <6, (8, 1), 5>
        - Cycle 9: <6, (1, 3), 7>
        - Cycle 10: <6, (9, 3), 2>
        - Cycle 11: <1, (5, 4), 3>
        - Cycle 12: <1, (7, 3), 6>
        - Cycle 13: <1, (8, 5), 7>
        - Cycle 14: <7, (8, 5), 6>
        - Cycle 15: <7, (3, 0), 1>
        - Cycle 16: <7, (6, 5), 8>
        - Cycle 17: <4, (8, 2), 5>
        - Cycle 18: <4, (6, 7), 3>
        - Cycle 19: <4, (3, 1), 0>
        - Cycle 20: <2, (9, 3), 0>
        - Cycle 21: <2, (7, 6), 8>
        - Cycle 22: <2, (5, 4), 8>
        - Cycle 23: <8, (5, 6), 7>
        - Cycle 24: <8, (3, 0), 1>
        - Cycle 25: <8, (6, 5), 7>
        - Cycle 26: <0, (7, 6), 1>
        - Cycle 27: <0, (3, 2), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

        There are 27 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [27].
