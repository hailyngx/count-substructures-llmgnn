Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 5) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 18) (15, 17) (6, 1) (9, 16) (9, 12) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 8) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 19) (8, 10) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 18) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 0) (10, 14) (17, 15) (17, 10) (17, 7) (18, 15) (18, 13) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 7) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (7, 15) (7, 17) (7, 0) (7, 19) (19, 8) (19, 5) (19, 7) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (4, 11) (4, 12) (14, 1) (14, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 9, 16)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 9, 12)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 1, 8)
- Cycle 5: (1, 6, 1, 12)
- Cycle 6: (1, 6, 1, 14)
- Cycle 7: (1, 14, 10, 15)
- Cycle 8: (1, 14, 10, 17)
- Cycle 9: (1, 14, 10, 0)
- Cycle 10: (1, 14, 10, 8)
- Cycle 11: (3, 5, 11, 16)
- Cycle 12: (3, 5, 13, 16)
- Cycle 13: (3, 5, 13, 18)
- Cycle 14: (3, 5, 19, 8)
- Cycle 15: (3, 8, 10, 15)
- Cycle 16: (3, 8, 13, 16)
- Cycle 17: (3, 8, 13, 18)
- Cycle 18: (3, 8, 19, 5)
- Cycle 19: (3, 8, 19, 7)
- Cycle 20: (3, 8, 1, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 6, 9, 16> (Chord: (1, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 6, 9, 12> (Chord: (1, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, 5, 11, 16> (Chord: (3, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, 5, 13, 16> (Chord: (3, 13))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, 5, 13, 18> (Chord: (5, 13))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordless cycles: [15]
