Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 16) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (11, 15) (11, 9) (0, 5) (0, 13) (7, 10) (10, 15) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 12) (17, 16) (4, 15) (4, 1) (4, 12) (4, 19) (12, 6) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 18) (18, 12) (18, 19) (19, 4) (19, 18) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 12) (8, 5) (8, 10) (16, 3) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 2) (2, 9) (2, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 3-1-4-15-3
- Cycle 2: 3-14-12-6-3
- Cycle 3: 3-16-17-16-3
- Cycle 4: 15-11-9-6-15
- Cycle 5: 15-10-7-10-15
- Cycle 6: 15-4-12-6-15
- Cycle 7: 6-5-8-10-6
- Cycle 8: 6-9-2-16-6
- Cycle 9: 9-14-12-6-9
- Cycle 10: 1-13-12-4-1
- Cycle 11: 5-0-13-1-5
- Cycle 12: 5-10-8-5

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 <3, 1, (3, 15), 4>
- Cycle 2 <3, 14, (6, 12), 6>
- Cycle 3 <3, 16, (3, 17), 16>
- Cycle 6 <15, 4, (6, 12), 15>
- Cycle 7 <6, 5, (5, 8), 10>
- Cycle 8 <6, 9, (9, 16), 6>
- Cycle 9 <9, 14, (6, 12), 9>
- Cycle 10 <1, 13, (1, 12), 4>
- Cycle 11 <5, 0, (1, 13), 5>
- Cycle 12 <5, 10, (5, 8), 10>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
