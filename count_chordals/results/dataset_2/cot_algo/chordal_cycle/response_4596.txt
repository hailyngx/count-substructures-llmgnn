Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 28) (9, 27) (26, 9) (26, 6) (26, 4) (22, 23) (22, 19) (22, 0) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 18) (23, 29) (23, 6) (12, 27) (12, 24) (27, 9) (27, 12) (27, 14) (27, 3) (27, 16) (0, 22) (0, 20) (0, 11) (0, 19) (20, 0) (20, 19) (28, 9) (28, 21) (28, 13) (29, 23) (29, 25) (29, 24) (21, 28) (21, 3) (21, 17) (1, 17) (1, 14) (1, 8) (17, 21) (17, 1) (17, 2) (3, 27) (3, 21) (3, 13) (10, 15) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 11) (6, 26) (6, 23) (6, 24) (6, 4) (24, 12) (24, 29) (24, 6) (24, 8) (24, 5) (25, 29) (25, 11) (19, 22) (19, 0) (19, 20) (19, 7) (5, 23) (5, 24) (5, 18) (18, 23) (18, 5) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 2) (16, 27) (8, 1) (8, 24) (8, 14) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 8) (11, 0) (11, 15) (11, 25) (13, 28) (13, 3) (2, 17) (2, 7) (4, 26) (4, 15) (4, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 2: (22, 23, 5, 18, 22)
- Cycle 3: (23, 6, 24, 29, 23)
- Cycle 4: (27, 12, 24, 6, 27)
- Cycle 5: (0, 22, 19, 20, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 11, 15, 4, 26)  
- Cycle 7: (20, 19, 7, 14, 20)
- Cycle 8: (28, 21, 3, 13, 28)
- Cycle 9: (29, 25, 11, 0, 22)
- Cycle 10: (21, 17, 2, 7, 21)
- Cycle 11: (1, 17, 21, 28, 13)
- Cycle 12: (3, 27, 14, 7, 3)
- Cycle 13: (10, 15, 11, 25, 10)

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (17, 28), 13>
- <3, (27, 7), 13>
- <10, (15, 25), 11>

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [10]
