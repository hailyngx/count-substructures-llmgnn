Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (12, 7) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 16) (5, 14) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 18) (8, 7) (8, 18) (9, 10) (9, 11) (9, 18) (9, 2) (15, 17) (19, 4) (19, 6) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 3) (4, 17) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 0) (6, 11) (6, 19) (6, 0) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (16, 5) (16, 17) (18, 13) (18, 8) (18, 9) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (14, 5) (14, 1) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 16) (17, 2) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (7, 1, 0, 11, 7)
- (7, 1, 0, 6, 7)
- (7, 12, 7, 1, 14)
- (7, 12, 7, 3, 13)
- (7, 8, 18, 9, 10)
- (7, 8, 18, 13, 10)
- (7, 3, 4, 19, 6)
- (7, 3, 13, 18, 8)
- (7, 3, 4, 17, 16)
- (8, 18, 13, 3, 7)
- (8, 18, 9, 2, 11)
- (8, 18, 13, 5, 4)
- (9, 11, 0, 1, 7)
- (9, 11, 0, 6, 19)
- (9, 11, 2, 17, 16)
- (9, 18, 13, 3, 7)
- (9, 18, 13, 5, 4)
- (9, 18, 8, 7, 12)
- (5, 13, 18, 8, 7)
- (5, 13, 3, 7, 12)
- (5, 13, 18, 9, 10)
- (4, 5, 14, 1, 7)
- (4, 5, 13, 3, 7)
- (4, 5, 16, 17, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <7, (3, 13), 18, 8>
- <9, (18, 8), 7, 12>
- <5, (13, 18), 8, 7>
- <4, (5, 14), 1, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
