Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 17) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 14) (21, 23) (28, 12) (28, 18) (22, 26) (22, 9) (22, 19) (22, 14) (22, 7) (26, 22) (26, 10) (26, 11) (26, 4) (9, 22) (1, 17) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 27) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 25) (17, 24) (4, 26) (4, 27) (27, 1) (27, 4) (27, 25) (8, 15) (8, 10) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 27) (25, 19) (25, 29) (19, 22) (19, 25) (19, 14) (19, 12) (10, 26) (10, 8) (12, 28) (12, 19) (12, 13) (12, 6) (16, 24) (16, 6) (24, 17) (24, 16) (24, 18) (24, 29) (2, 23) (14, 20) (14, 22) (14, 19) (14, 23) (7, 20) (7, 22) (7, 1) (0, 11) (0, 29) (13, 1) (13, 12) (13, 11) (18, 28) (18, 24) (18, 6) (6, 12) (6, 16) (6, 18) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 14) (23, 29) (11, 26) (11, 0) (11, 13) (3, 5) (3, 29) (29, 25) (29, 24) (29, 0) (29, 23) (29, 3) (5, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (1, 17, 25, 27, 1)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 27, 25, 17, 1, 7, 22, 4)
        - Cycle 3: (24, 29, 3, 5, 3, 29, 24)
        - Cycle 4: (6, 12, 13, 1, 7, 22, 19, 14, 23, 29, 24, 16, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has no chord.
        - Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (1, 17).
        - Cycle 3 has no chord.
        - Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (12, 19).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [2].

Unique Chordal 4-Cycles:
        - <1, 17, 25, 27, 1> (Chord: (1, 17))
        - <6, 12, 13, 1, 7, 22, 19, 14, 23, 29, 24, 16, 6> (Chord: (12, 19))
