Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 18) (4, 7) (4, 16) (4, 17) (7, 4) (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 2) (3, 19) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 13) (11, 17) (6, 5) (6, 16) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 10) (14, 8) (18, 9) (18, 13) (18, 8) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 11) (15, 19) (15, 8) (8, 14) (8, 18) (8, 15) (8, 19) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 8) (19, 2) (19, 13) (12, 1) (12, 0) (12, 16) (16, 4) (16, 6) (16, 12) (16, 13) (2, 3) (2, 19) (13, 11) (13, 18) (13, 19) (13, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Four cycles found:
1. <0, 5, 6, 0>
2. <1, 3, 10, 14, 1>
3. <4, 7, 4, 16, 13, 4>
4. <8, 14, 10, 11, 17, 1, 12, 0, 8>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord:
<4, 7, (4, 16), 13, 4> 

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the answer is [1].
