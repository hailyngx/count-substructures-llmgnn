Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 18) (3, 29) (15, 3) (15, 26) (4, 16) (4, 11) (7, 21) (7, 12) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 28) (21, 2) (2, 21) (2, 29) (2, 19) (2, 16) (29, 3) (29, 2) (29, 0) (29, 22) (0, 29) (0, 17) (0, 13) (20, 9) (20, 23) (20, 11) (12, 7) (12, 25) (12, 1) (12, 9) (28, 21) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 14) (28, 24) (13, 0) (13, 26) (13, 18) (26, 15) (26, 13) (26, 5) (8, 9) (8, 24) (8, 6) (9, 3) (9, 20) (9, 12) (9, 8) (9, 25) (10, 18) (10, 23) (10, 16) (18, 3) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 27) (19, 2) (5, 26) (22, 29) (22, 28) (22, 16) (25, 12) (25, 9) (14, 3) (14, 28) (24, 28) (24, 8) (27, 18) (16, 4) (16, 2) (16, 10) (16, 22) (11, 4) (11, 20) (11, 17) (17, 0) (17, 11) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 28) (1, 23) (6, 8) (6, 23) (23, 20) (23, 10) (23, 1) (23, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 26, 13, 0, 29, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 26, 13, 18, 10, 23, 1, 7, 21, 2, 29, 3)
- Cycle 3: (4, 16, 2, 21, 7, 12, 9, 20, 11, 4)
- Cycle 4: (21, 2, 16, 4, 11, 20, 9, 12, 7, 1, 28, 21)
- Cycle 5: (0, 29, 2, 21, 28, 1, 23, 10, 18, 13, 26, 15, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <3, (13, 18), 26, 15>
- <3, (7, 21), 2, 29>
- <4, (2, 21), 7, 12>
- <21, (16, 4), 11, 20>
- <0, (2, 29), 21, 28>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. Therefore, there are [1] unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
