Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
Here are the cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-6-1-9-0
- Cycle 2: 0-6-1-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-7-5-0
- Cycle 4: 0-1-9-5-0
- Cycle 5: 0-3-5-9-0
- Cycle 6: 0-3-8-9-0
- Cycle 7: 0-4-5-9-0
- Cycle 8: 0-4-6-5-0
- Cycle 9: 1-6-3-8-1
- Cycle 10: 1-6-7-5-1
- Cycle 11: 1-7-5-9-1
- Cycle 12: 2-5-3-8-2
- Cycle 13: 2-5-9-1-2
- Cycle 14: 2-8-9-5-2
- Cycle 15: 3-5-7-1-3
- Cycle 16: 3-6-1-9-3
- Cycle 17: 4-0-1-6-4
- Cycle 18: 4-0-3-5-4
- Cycle 19: 4-5-9-0-4
- Cycle 20: 5-2-8-3-5
- Cycle 21: 5-4-6-0-5
- Cycle 22: 6-1-9-3-6
- Cycle 23: 7-1-6-3-7
- Cycle 24: 7-5-9-1-7
- Cycle 25: 8-2-5-9-8
- Cycle 26: 9-0-6-4-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
Here is the unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, 1, (6, 9), 0> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are [25] chordless cycles in the graph.
