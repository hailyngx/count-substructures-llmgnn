Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 15) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 13) (14, 10) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 18) (9, 17) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 2) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 15) (7, 19) (7, 10) (16, 13) (16, 18) (1, 6) (1, 9) (18, 8) (18, 16) (18, 19) (18, 15) (19, 7) (19, 18) (19, 15) (15, 5) (15, 12) (15, 18) (15, 19) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 17) (11, 0) (11, 4) (11, 17) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 17) (17, 9) (17, 2) (17, 11) (17, 3) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 7) (13, 0) (13, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (0, 6, 1, 9, 3, 0)
        - Cycle 2: (4, 6, 1, 9, 4)
        - Cycle 3: (8, 10, 7, 19, 18, 8)
        - Cycle 4: (12, 4, 2, 17, 3, 12)
        - Cycle 5: (15, 5, 2, 17, 11, 15)
        - Cycle 6: (18, 8, 3, 17, 19, 18)
        - Cycle 7: (19, 15, 12, 4, 11, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Cycle 1 has no chords.
        - Cycle 2 has no chords.
        - Cycle 3 has no chords.
        - Cycle 4 has no chords.
        - Cycle 5 has no chords.
        - Cycle 6 has the chord (4, 19).
        - Cycle 7 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 6 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [6].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <(4, 19), (18, 8), (3, 17), (5, 15)>.
