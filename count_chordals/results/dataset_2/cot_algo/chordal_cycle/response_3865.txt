Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 10) (9, 7) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (1, 15) (1, 0) (17, 12) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 4) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 1) (15, 17) (5, 11) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 6) (19, 13) (19, 10) (19, 5) (19, 4) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 4) (12, 3) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 18) (16, 12) (16, 4) (14, 8) (4, 17) (4, 19) (4, 0) (4, 16) (18, 17) (18, 12) (18, 7) (2, 6) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 5) (7, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (6, 2, 19, 6)
- Cycle 2: (9, 15, 1, 0, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 15, 17, 12, 3, 8, 13, 19, 10, 9)
- Cycle 4: (8, 13, 19, 4, 17, 15, 9, 7, 5, 11, 10, 8)
- Cycle 5: (8, 13, 7, 5, 19, 4, 0, 1, 15, 17, 12, 3, 8)
- Cycle 6: (13, 19, 4, 16, 12, 17, 15, 1, 0, 11, 5, 7)
- Cycle 7: (10, 9, 15, 17, 4, 19, 5, 11, 0, 1, 15, 10)
- Cycle 8: (10, 11, 5, 7, 18, 12, 17, 15, 1, 0, 4, 10)
- Cycle 9: (3, 8, 13, 19, 4, 16, 12, 17, 15, 1, 0, 11, 5, 7, 18, 3)
- Cycle 10: (1, 15, 17, 18, 7, 13, 19, 10, 9, 7, 5, 11, 0, 4, 16, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 2 has one chord: (1, 15)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 15)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (8, 13)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (8, 13)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (13, 19)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (10, 11)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (10, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <2, (1, 15), 0, 9>
2. <3, (1, 15), 17, 12>
3. <4, (8, 13), 10, 9>
4. <5, (8, 13), 4, 17>
5. <6, (13, 19), 12, 17>
6. <7, (10, 11), 5, 7>
