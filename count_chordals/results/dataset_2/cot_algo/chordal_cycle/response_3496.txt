Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 9-5-3-7-9
- Cycle 2: 9-5-3-1-9
- Cycle 3: 9-1-6-2-9
- Cycle 4: 9-1-6-2-4-8-9
- Cycle 5: 9-1-6-2-8-7-9
- Cycle 6: 0-5-3-1-9-0
- Cycle 7: 0-5-3-1-6-2-0
- Cycle 8: 0-5-3-7-8-4-0
- Cycle 9: 0-5-9-1-6-2-0
- Cycle 10: 0-5-9-8-7-3-0
- Cycle 11: 0-1-9-8-4-2-0
- Cycle 12: 0-1-6-2-4-8-0

Step 2:
Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
For Cycle 1, there is a chord <5, 3>.
For Cycle 2, there is a chord <5, 1>.
For Cycle 3, there is a chord <1, 6>.
For Cycle 4, there are no chords.
For Cycle 5, there are no chords.
For Cycle 6, there is a chord <5, 1>.
For Cycle 7, there is a chord <5, 3>.
For Cycle 8, there are no chords.
For Cycle 9, there is a chord <5, 6>.
For Cycle 10, there is a chord <1, 8>.
For Cycle 11, there is a chord <1, 8>.
For Cycle 12, there are no chords.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (5, 3), 9>
<2, (5, 1), 9>
<3, (1, 6), 9>
<7, (5, 1), 3>
<9, (5, 6), 0>
