Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 8) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 14) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 28) (9, 10) (9, 12) (15, 27) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 21) (27, 15) (27, 20) (27, 13) (7, 15) (7, 21) (7, 3) (7, 22) (21, 15) (21, 7) (21, 3) (22, 7) (22, 19) (22, 4) (22, 24) (23, 2) (23, 28) (28, 9) (28, 23) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 20) (29, 26) (2, 23) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 17) (2, 14) (8, 11) (8, 2) (8, 26) (17, 2) (17, 13) (17, 25) (17, 6) (20, 27) (20, 29) (4, 22) (4, 26) (13, 27) (13, 17) (13, 6) (3, 7) (3, 21) (3, 0) (3, 18) (25, 17) (25, 6) (25, 10) (19, 15) (19, 22) (6, 11) (6, 17) (6, 13) (6, 25) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 18) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 3) (26, 15) (26, 29) (26, 8) (26, 4) (14, 16) (14, 2) (24, 22) (10, 9) (10, 25) (18, 5) (18, 3) (18, 1) (12, 9) 

Response:
Step 1:  
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 1, 14)
- Cycle 2: (5, 18, 3, 0)
- Cycle 3: (9, 28, 29, 20)
- Cycle 4: (15, 27, 13, 17)
- Cycle 5: (7, 21, 3, 22)
- Cycle 6: (22, 19, 15, 21)
- Cycle 7: (23, 2, 8, 26)
- Cycle 8: (25, 17, 6, 13)

Step 2:  
- Checking Cycle 1 (11, 16, 1, 14): <12, (11, 14)>
- Checking Cycle 2 (5, 18, 3, 0): <2, (0, 5)>
- Checking Cycle 3 (9, 28, 29, 20): <5, (9, 29)>
- Checking Cycle 4 (15, 27, 13, 17): <8, (15, 17)>
- Checking Cycle 5 (7, 21, 3, 22): <28, (3, 22)>
- Checking Cycle 6 (22, 19, 15, 21): <19, (15, 22)>
- Checking Cycle 7 (23, 2, 8, 26): <9, (2, 8)>
- Checking Cycle 8 (25, 17, 6, 13): <16, (6, 17)>

Step 3:  
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found.  
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
