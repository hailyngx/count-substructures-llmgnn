Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 4, 8, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 7, 0, 1, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 2, 4, 5, 6)
- Cycle 4: (9, 4, 2, 7, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 1, 0, 7, 9)
- Cycle 6: (4, 8, 3, 0, 4)
- Cycle 7: (7, 0, 3, 5, 7)
- Cycle 8: (8, 3, 5, 2, 8)
- Cycle 9: (0, 1, 8, 6, 0)
- Cycle 10: (2, 7, 5, 3, 2)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (9, 8), 4>
- Cycle 2: <2, (1, 7), 6>
- Cycle 3: <3, (4, 5), 6>
- Cycle 4: <4, (9, 2), 7>
- Cycle 5: <5, (0, 9), 7>
- Cycle 6: <6, (4, 8), 0>
- Cycle 7: <7, (0, 5), 3>
- Cycle 8: <8, (2, 5), 7>
- Cycle 9: <9, (8, 1), 0>
- Cycle 10: <10, (3, 5), 7>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
