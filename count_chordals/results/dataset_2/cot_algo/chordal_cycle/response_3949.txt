Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: 1-4-7-5-3-1
        - Cycle 2: 1-4-8-5-2-1
        - Cycle 3: 1-4-8-7-3-1
        - Cycle 4: 1-7-4-8-5-1
        - Cycle 5: 1-7-4-8-1
        - Cycle 6: 1-7-8-4-5-1
        - Cycle 7: 1-7-8-5-2-1
        - Cycle 8: 1-8-4-7-5-1
        - Cycle 9: 1-8-4-7-1
        - Cycle 10: 1-8-7-4-5-1
        - Cycle 11: 3-7-4-8-5-3
        - Cycle 12: 3-7-8-4-5-3

Step 2: Check for chords in the cycles:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord: <1, (4, 7), 3>
        - Cycle 2 does not have a chord
        - Cycle 3 does not have a chord
        - Cycle 4 has a chord: <1, (4, 8), 5>
        - Cycle 5 does not have a chord
        - Cycle 6 does not have a chord
        - Cycle 7 does not have a chord
        - Cycle 8 does not have a chord
        - Cycle 9 does not have a chord
        - Cycle 10 has a chord: <1, (4, 7), 5>
        - Cycle 11 does not have a chord
        - Cycle 12 does not have a chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the answer is [3].

        The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
        <1, (4, 7), 3>
        <1, (4, 8), 5>
        <1, (4, 7), 5>
