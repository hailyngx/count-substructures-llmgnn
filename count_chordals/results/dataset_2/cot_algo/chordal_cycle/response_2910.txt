Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-9-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-6-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-6-7-1-0
- Cycle 4: 0-6-3-8-0
- Cycle 5: 1-4-2-8-1

Step 2:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (6, 1)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (6, 3)
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (4, 8)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (9, 2), 0>
- <2, (6, 7), 0>
- <3, (6, 1), 0>
- <4, (6, 3), 0>
- <5, (4, 8), 1>
