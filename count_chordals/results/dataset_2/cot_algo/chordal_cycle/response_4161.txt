Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 1) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 13) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 11) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 10) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
1. (6, 5, 4, 7, 6)
2. (9, 2, 0, 7, 4, 9)
3. (9, 1, 4, 5, 3, 9)
4. (9, 12, 10, 8, 3, 9)
5. (4, 13, 0, 2, 9, 4)
6. (7, 11, 5, 3, 0, 7)
7. (12, 14, 11, 1, 9, 12)
8. (2, 13, 0, 7, 11, 2)
9. (8, 1, 9, 12, 14, 8)
10. (5, 4, 1, 9, 12, 5)
11. (0, 2, 9, 3, 5, 0)
12. (3, 8, 1, 11, 14, 3)
13. (11, 7, 4, 1, 9, 11)
14. (14, 12, 10, 4, 1, 14)
15. (1, 11, 7, 0, 2, 1)
16. (10, 8, 3, 0, 13, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycle found is:
<4, 5, 3, 9, 4> with chord (1, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle, the count of chordless cycles is [15].
