Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 4) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 0) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 4) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 2) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: 1-13-8-12-0-7-1
- Cycle 2: 1-9-3-14-7-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-0-12-8-13-1
- Cycle 4: 3-14-7-12-0-2-3
- Cycle 5: 3-9-2-0-12-8-3
- Cycle 6: 10-11-5-8-6-3-10
- Cycle 7: 10-6-3-9-2-0-10
- Cycle 8: 10-12-0-7-14-6-10
- Cycle 9: 11-5-0-12-7-1-11
- Cycle 10: 11-12-0-2-9-3-11
- Cycle 11: 12-0-2-9-7-14-12
- Cycle 12: 5-8-12-0-7-14-5
- Cycle 13: 5-4-13-8-12-11-5
- Cycle 14: 6-3-9-7-14-4-6
- Cycle 15: 6-8-12-0-2-3-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1, <(8, 12), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2, <(1, 3), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3, <(0, 12), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4, <(7, 12), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5, <(3, 0), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6, <(5, 8), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7, <(6, 9), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8, <(10, 7), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9, <(1, 11), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10, <(12, 2), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the final answer is [10].
