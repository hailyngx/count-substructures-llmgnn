Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 22) (9, 20) (26, 10) (26, 27) (3, 15) (3, 5) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 8) (15, 29) (6, 9) (6, 25) (2, 17) (29, 15) (29, 14) (29, 10) (7, 21) (7, 0) (7, 27) (7, 1) (21, 7) (21, 8) (21, 14) (21, 4) (8, 3) (8, 15) (8, 21) (8, 24) (23, 12) (23, 13) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (17, 2) (17, 20) (17, 1) (17, 16) (19, 28) (19, 27) (13, 23) (13, 16) (13, 20) (22, 9) (22, 14) (22, 0) (20, 9) (20, 17) (20, 13) (20, 12) (0, 7) (0, 18) (0, 22) (4, 21) (4, 12) (4, 24) (4, 1) (27, 26) (27, 7) (27, 19) (27, 10) (11, 12) (5, 3) (12, 23) (12, 20) (12, 4) (12, 11) (28, 19) (1, 7) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 10) (16, 18) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 10) (10, 26) (10, 29) (10, 27) (10, 1) (10, 16) (14, 29) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 25) (24, 8) (24, 4) (25, 6) (25, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: (3, 15, 29, 14)
        - Cycle 2: (7, 27, 26, 10, 1)
        - Cycle 3: (9, 6, 25, 14)
        - Cycle 4: (9, 20, 13, 16)
        - Cycle 5: (16, 13, 23, 12)
        - Cycle 6: (20, 13, 23, 12)
        - Cycle 7: (20, 13, 16, 17)
        - Cycle 8: (20, 13, 16, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Only Cycle 1: (3, 15, 29, 14) has exactly one chord (15, 29). Therefore, it forms a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        - There is 1 chordal 4-cycle, so the final count is [1].

Unique Chordal 4-cycle found:
        - <3, (15, 29), 14>
