Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 4-7-1-5-4
- Cycle 2: 4-7-8-5-4
- Cycle 3: 4-9-1-5-4
- Cycle 4: 4-9-2-5-4
- Cycle 5: 4-2-5-8-4
- Cycle 6: 4-2-9-0-4
- Cycle 7: 4-0-6-1-4
- Cycle 8: 4-0-9-2-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle: <1, 5, (7, 8)>
- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle: <4, 5, (7, 8)>
- Cycle 3 is a chordal 4-cycle: <1, 9, (4, 5)>
- Cycle 4 is a chordal 4-cycle: <2, 9, (4, 5)>
- Cycle 5 is not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 6 is a chordal 4-cycle: <2, 9, (0, 4)>
- Cycle 7 is a chordal 4-cycle: <1, 6, (0, 4)>
- Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle: <2, 9, (0, 4)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 5, (7, 8)>
- <4, 5, (7, 8)>
- <1, 9, (4, 5)>
- <2, 9, (4, 5)>
- <1, 6, (0, 4)>
