Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 10) (3, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 12) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 10) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 11) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 7) (10, 9) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 13) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 12) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 10) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 5) (13, 2) (13, 11) (13, 0) (13, 6) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1:  
There are several cycles in the graph of length 4 or more. After checking, the following cycles are found:  
- Cycle 1: 4-8-2-13-4  
- Cycle 2: 4-8-5-12-4  
- Cycle 3: 4-8-1-11-4  
- Cycle 4: 4-9-10-2-4  
- Cycle 5: 4-9-1-6-4  
- Cycle 6: 4-1-6-11-4  
- Cycle 7: 4-1-14-12-4  
- Cycle 8: 8-2-13-11-8  
- Cycle 9: 8-5-7-0-8  
- Cycle 10: 8-5-7-10-8  
- Cycle 11: 8-1-11-13-8  
- Cycle 12: 8-1-6-4-8  
- Cycle 13: 2-10-9-4-2  
- Cycle 14: 2-10-7-5-2  
- Cycle 15: 3-7-10-9-3  
- Cycle 16: 11-1-14-13-11  
- Cycle 17: 11-6-12-14-11  
- Cycle 18: 0-7-5-12-0  
- Cycle 19: 0-7-10-9-0  
- Cycle 20: 0-13-14-12-0  

Step 2:  
After checking each cycle, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:  
<4, (8, 1), 11>  

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [1].
