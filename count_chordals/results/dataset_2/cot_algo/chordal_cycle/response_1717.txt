Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-8-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-3-6-1-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-7-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-1-6-3-4-0
- Cycle 5: 0-1-6-9-4-0
- Cycle 6: 0-1-8-4-0
- Cycle 7: 0-1-8-3-6-0
- Cycle 8: 0-2-5-1-0
- Cycle 9: 0-2-5-4-3-0
- Cycle 10: 0-2-3-4-0
- Cycle 11: 0-2-3-6-1-0
- Cycle 12: 0-2-7-1-0
- Cycle 13: 0-2-7-9-6-0
- Cycle 14: 0-4-9-6-3-0
- Cycle 15: 0-4-2-7-1-0

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-8-1-0  (<4, 1>)
- Cycle 2: 0-1-8-4-0  (<8,  1>) 
- Cycle 3: 0-2-5-4-3-0  (<5, 3>) 

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
