Step 2: Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <9, (26, 1), 3, 9>
- <16, (2, 14), 11, 16>
- <16, (18, 1), 2, 16>
- <16, (2, 25), 21, 16>
- <16, (2, 18), 14, 16>
- <17, (20, 25), 21, 17>
- <17, (26, 1), 3, 17>
- <1, (18, 2), 25, 1>
- <3, (1, 18), 2, 3>
- <20, (17, 28), 27, 20>
- <25, (6, 8), 22, 25>
- <25, (2, 16), 12, 25>
- <12, (10, 20), 17, 12>
- <27, (28, 17), 26, 27>
- <2, (16, 0), 14, 2>
- <2, (16, 12), 10, 2>
- <0, (16, 2), 14, 0>
- <12, (6, 8), 22, 12>
- <5, (28, 17), 26, 5>
- <23, (26, 1), 3, 23>
- <23, (7, 27), 29, 23>
- <19, (13, 21), 25, 19>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 21 unique chordal 4-cycles found in total, so the final count is [21].
