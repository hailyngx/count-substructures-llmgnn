Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 4) (11, 2) (11, 20) (11, 25) (16, 11) (1, 21) (1, 25) (1, 20) (1, 24) (21, 1) (21, 23) (21, 2) (7, 20) (7, 6) (7, 22) (8, 5) (8, 0) (13, 29) (10, 27) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 5) (17, 18) (2, 11) (2, 21) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 27) (18, 29) (22, 7) (22, 26) (22, 9) (26, 22) (26, 28) (26, 15) (9, 17) (9, 22) (9, 15) (28, 26) (28, 3) (28, 0) (28, 14) (5, 8) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 2) (19, 5) (29, 13) (29, 18) (29, 23) (0, 8) (0, 28) (0, 23) (23, 21) (23, 29) (23, 0) (3, 28) (3, 6) (3, 12) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 3) (24, 1) (24, 20) (15, 26) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 4) (20, 11) (20, 1) (20, 7) (20, 24) (14, 18) (14, 28) (14, 5) (14, 15) (25, 11) (25, 1) (25, 12) (27, 10) (27, 18) (12, 3) (12, 25) (4, 11) (4, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 11 -> 16 -> 11 -> 4 -> 15 -> 11
- Cycle 2: 11 -> 25 -> 12 -> 25 -> 11
- Cycle 3: 1 -> 21 -> 2 -> 19 -> 1
- Cycle 4: 20 -> 7 -> 22 -> 9 -> 20
- Cycle 5: 18 -> 2 -> 21 -> 23 -> 18
- Cycle 6: 26 -> 22 -> 7 -> 6 -> 26
- Cycle 7: 9 -> 17 -> 18 -> 29 -> 9
- Cycle 8: 28 -> 26 -> 22 -> 9 -> 28
- Cycle 9: 5 -> 8 -> 0 -> 28 -> 5
- Cycle 10: 19 -> 5 -> 8 -> 0 -> 19
- Cycle 11: 29 -> 13 -> 4 -> 15 -> 29
- Cycle 12: 15 -> 26 -> 22 -> 9 -> 15
- Cycle 13: 20 -> 1 -> 24 -> 20
- Cycle 14: 14 -> 18 -> 17 -> 6 -> 14
- Cycle 15: 25 -> 1 -> 21 -> 2 -> 25
- Cycle 16: 27 -> 18 -> 2 -> 21 -> 27
- Cycle 17: 12 -> 25 -> 1 -> 24 -> 12

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for a single chord:

<11, 4, 15, 11> has chord (4, 15)
<11, 25, 12, 25> has chord (25, 12)
<1, 21, 2, 19> has chord (2, 19)
<20, 7, 22, 9> has chord (7, 9)
<18, 2, 21, 23> has chord (2, 23)
<26, 22, 7, 6> has chord (22, 6)
<9, 17, 18, 29> has chord (17, 29)
<28, 26, 22, 9> has chord (26, 9)
<5, 8, 0, 28> has chord (8, 28)
<19, 5, 8, 0> has chord (5, 0)
<29, 13, 4, 15> has chord (13, 15)
<15, 26, 22, 9> has chord (26, 9)
<20, 1, 24, 20> has chord (1, 24)
<14, 18, 17, 6> has chord (18, 6)
<25, 1, 21, 2> has chord (1, 2)
<27, 18, 2, 21> has chord (18, 21)
<12, 25, 1, 24> has chord (25, 24)

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].
