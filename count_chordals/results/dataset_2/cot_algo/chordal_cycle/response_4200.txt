Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0)

- Cycle <5, 7, 9, 2>
- Cycle <6, 2, 9, 0>
- Cycle <7, 9, 0, 4>
- Cycle <7, 9, 2, 6>
- Cycle <8, 1, 3, 0>
- Cycle <8, 1, 6, 2>
- Cycle <8, 2, 6, 1>
- Cycle <8, 2, 6, 5>
- Cycle <9, 7, 5, 4>
- Cycle <9, 2, 1, 3>

Step 2:  
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 4, 3, 1> with chord (3, 0)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 3, 4, 8> with chord (3, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 6, 5, 4> with chord (6, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 8, 4, 5> with chord (8, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 6, 1, 3> with chord (6, 1)
  
Step 3:  
Number of chordless cycles found = [31]
