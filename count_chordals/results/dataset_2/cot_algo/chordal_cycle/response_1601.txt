Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 15) (1, 28) (1, 22) (1, 18) (21, 3) (21, 23) (2, 29) (29, 2) (29, 9) (29, 7) (29, 0) (5, 9) (5, 26) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 29) (9, 5) (9, 22) (9, 28) (10, 17) (10, 22) (11, 12) (20, 26) (20, 3) (20, 28) (25, 27) (25, 23) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 15) (17, 7) (6, 17) (6, 28) (6, 16) (28, 1) (28, 9) (28, 20) (28, 6) (22, 1) (22, 9) (22, 10) (22, 16) (22, 24) (0, 29) (0, 16) (0, 12) (0, 26) (7, 29) (7, 5) (7, 17) (15, 1) (15, 17) (15, 8) (15, 4) (18, 1) (18, 27) (18, 24) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 0) (3, 21) (3, 20) (3, 13) (16, 6) (16, 22) (16, 0) (27, 25) (27, 18) (8, 15) (8, 19) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 13) (14, 19) (14, 12) (14, 13) (24, 22) (24, 18) (23, 21) (23, 25) (23, 12) (13, 3) (13, 19) (13, 14) (12, 11) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 23) (4, 5) (4, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 15, 17, 7, 5, 9, 28, 6, 16, 0, 12, 14, 13, 3, 20, 26)
- Cycle 2: (1, 22, 10, 17, 15, 4, 5, 7, 17)
- Cycle 3: (1, 28, 6, 17, 15, 8, 19, 13, 3, 20, 26, 5, 9)
- Cycle 4: (1, 28, 20, 3, 13, 19, 8, 15, 17, 10, 22)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: <1, 5>
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <1, 10>
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <1, 9>
- Cycle 4 has a chord: <20, 10>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count is [0].
