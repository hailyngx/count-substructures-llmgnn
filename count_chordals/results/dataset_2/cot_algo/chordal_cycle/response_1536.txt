        - Cycle <2, 8, 11, 1>
        - Cycle <2, 8, 5, 4>
        - Cycle <2, 10, 7, 3>
        - Cycle <2, 10, 7, 1>
        - Cycle <3, 7, 10, 2>
        - Cycle <3, 8, 11, 1>
        - Cycle <3, 11, 14, 5>
        - Cycle <4, 0, 3, 7>
        - Cycle <4, 0, 7, 1>
        - Cycle <4, 5, 8, 11>
        - Cycle <5, 2, 6, 0>
        - Cycle <5, 8, 11, 1>
        - Cycle <5, 12, 9, 0>
        - Cycle <6, 0, 4, 5>
        - Cycle <6, 1, 7, 3>
        - Cycle <7, 0, 9, 12>
        - Cycle <7, 1, 6, 2>
        - Cycle <7, 3, 11, 14>
        - Cycle <7, 10, 2, 6>
        - Cycle <9, 0, 4, 5>
        - Cycle <9, 12, 1, 14>

        - Cycle <14, 1, 6, 2>
        - Cycle <14, 5, 8, 11>

Step 2: Check for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle <0, 3, 7, 1> has a chord (3, 1)
        - Cycle <0, 3, 11, 1> has a chord (3, 1)
        - Cycle <0, 4, 11, 1> has a chord (4, 1)
        - Cycle <0, 7, 10, 2> has a chord (7, 2)
        - Cycle <0, 9, 12, 1> has a chord (9, 1)
        - Cycle <1, 11, 14, 5> has a chord (11, 5)
        - Cycle <1, 6, 2, 5> has a chord (6, 5)
        - Cycle <2, 8, 11, 1> has a chord (8, 11)
        - Cycle <3, 7, 10, 2> has a chord (7, 2)
        - Cycle <4, 5, 8, 11> has a chord (5, 8)
        - Cycle <6, 1, 7, 3> has a chord (1, 3)
        - Cycle <7, 0, 9, 12> has a chord (0, 12)
        - Cycle <10, 2, 6, 1> has a chord (2, 6)
        - Cycle <12, 1, 7, 3> has a chord (1, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 14 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [14].

        Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <0, 3, 7, 1>
        <0, 3, 11, 1>
        <0, 4, 11, 1>
        <0, 7, 10, 2>
        <0, 9, 12, 1>
        <1, 11, 14, 5>
        <1, 6, 2, 5>
        <2, 8, 11, 1>
        <3, 7, 10, 2>
        <4, 5, 8, 11>
        <6, 1, 7, 3>
        <7, 0, 9, 12>
        <10, 2, 6, 1>
        <12, 1, 7, 3>
