Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 13) (8, 4) (8, 13) (8, 1) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 3) (1, 8) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 12) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 12) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 3) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 12) (12, 5) (12, 1) (12, 11) (12, 9) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: 4-7-6-5-4
        - Cycle 2: 4-7-13-5-4
        - Cycle 3: 4-8-13-5-4
        - Cycle 4: 7-6-5-13-7
        - Cycle 5: 5-6-7-13-5
        - Cycle 6: 2-5-13-7-2
        - Cycle 7: 1-8-13-7-1
        - Cycle 8: 3-7-13-5-3
        - Cycle 9: 11-4-8-1-11
        - Cycle 10: 2-5-6-7-2
        - Cycle 11: 6-7-3-0-6
        - Cycle 12: 14-13-5-6-14
        - Cycle 13: 9-2-5-13-9
        - Cycle 14: 12-1-8-13-12
        - Cycle 15: 10-6-7-3-10

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
        - <4, (7, 13), 5> - Chord (7, 13)
        - <4, (8, 13), 5> - Chord (8, 13)
        - <7, (6, 5), 13> - Chord (6, 5)
        - <5, (6, 7), 13> - Chord (6, 7)
        - <2, (5, 13), 7> - Chord (5, 13)
        - <1, (8, 13), 7> - Chord (8, 13)
        - <3, (7, 13), 5> - Chord (7, 13)
        - <11, (4, 8), 1> - Chord (4, 8)
        - <2, (5, 6), 7> - Chord (5, 6)
        - <6, (7, 3), 0> - Chord (7, 3)
        - <14, (13, 5), 6> - Chord (13, 5)
        - <9, (2, 5), 13> - Chord (2, 5)
        - <12, (1, 8), 13> - Chord (1, 8)
        - <10, (6, 7), 3> - Chord (6, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [14]
