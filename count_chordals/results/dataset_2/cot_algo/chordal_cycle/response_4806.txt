Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 9 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 2: 4 - 3 - 5 - 2 - 4
- Cycle 3: 4 - 1 - 6 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 4: 7 - 9 - 2 - 5 - 7
- Cycle 5: 7 - 5 - 3 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 6: 1 - 6 - 8 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 7: 3 - 5 - 2 - 9 - 3
- Cycle 8: 6 - 8 - 0 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 9: 9 - 1 - 0 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 10: 8 - 3 - 0 - 6 - 8

Step 2:
After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <4, (7, 9), 1>

Step 3:
The final number of chordless cycles is [9].
