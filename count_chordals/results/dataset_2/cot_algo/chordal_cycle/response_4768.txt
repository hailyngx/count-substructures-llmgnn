Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 13) (13, 2) (13, 15) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 4) (4, 10) (4, 17) (12, 5) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 14) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 3) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 6) (19, 3) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 0) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 8) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (11, 14, 7, 16, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 17, 3, 14, 11)
- Cycle 3: (16, 18, 15, 0, 16)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 8, 2, 5)
- Cycle 5: (10, 15, 13, 2, 10)
- Cycle 6: (10, 7, 14, 11, 10)
- Cycle 7: (9, 5, 0, 15, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 18, 6, 2, 9)
- Cycle 9: (8, 9, 18, 16, 8)
- Cycle 10: (15, 13, 2, 6, 15)
- Cycle 11: (15, 0, 3, 17, 15)
- Cycle 12: (13, 15, 0, 6, 13)
- Cycle 13: (17, 4, 10, 11, 17)
- Cycle 14: (4, 10, 15, 0, 4)
- Cycle 15: (7, 16, 18, 9, 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 14, 3, 17, 7)
- Cycle 17: (14, 11, 10, 4, 14)
- Cycle 18: (14, 7, 16, 1, 14)
- Cycle 19: (18, 15, 10, 7, 18)
- Cycle 20: (18, 9, 5, 0, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (2, 6), 18>
2. <1, (2, 6), 15>
3. <1, (6, 18), 2>
4. <1, (15, 6), 2>
5. <1, (15, 13), 2>
6. <5, (8, 18), 9>
7. <5, (8, 2), 9>
8. <5, (9, 2), 8>
9. <5, (9, 18), 8>
10. <9, (5, 0), 15>
11. <9, (5, 18), 8>
12. <9, (0, 15), 5>
13. <9, (18, 15), 5>
14. <10, (11, 17), 3>
15. <10, (4, 0), 15>
16. <10, (15, 13), 2>
17. <16, (7, 14), 11>
18. <16, (7, 10), 14>
19. <16, (14, 3), 7>
20. <16, (18, 15), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [20].
