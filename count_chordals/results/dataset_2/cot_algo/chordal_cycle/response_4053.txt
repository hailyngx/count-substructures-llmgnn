Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-3-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-6-2-5
- Cycle 3: 5-1-4-7-5
- Cycle 4: 5-1-4-0-5
- Cycle 5: 5-1-9-6-5
- Cycle 6: 5-4-7-9-5
- Cycle 7: 5-4-7-0-5
- Cycle 8: 5-4-1-9-5
- Cycle 9: 5-8-2-6-5
- Cycle 10: 5-8-2-4-5
- Cycle 11: 5-8-2-9-5
- Cycle 12: 5-0-4-1-5
- Cycle 13: 5-0-4-7-5

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3: 5-1-4-7-5 has a chord (1, 7) -> Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 4: 5-1-4-0-5 has a chord (1, 0) -> Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 5: 5-1-9-6-5 has a chord (1, 6) -> Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 6: 5-4-7-9-5 has a chord (4, 9) -> Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 7: 5-4-7-0-5 has a chord (4, 7) -> Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 8: 5-4-1-9-5 has a chord (4, 1) -> Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 9: 5-8-2-6-5 has a chord (8, 2) -> Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 10: 5-8-2-4-5 has a chord (8, 2) -> Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 11: 5-8-2-9-5 has a chord (8, 2) -> Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 12: 5-0-4-1-5 has a chord (0, 4) -> Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 13: 5-0-4-7-5 has a chord (0, 4) -> Not a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordal 4-cycles found in this graph. So, the answer is [0].
