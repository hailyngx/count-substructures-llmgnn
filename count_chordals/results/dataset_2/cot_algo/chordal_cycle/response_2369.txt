Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (15, 3) (15, 0) (4, 10) (4, 16) (7, 6) (7, 19) (7, 14) (7, 9) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 17) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 9) (18, 17) (18, 1) (5, 19) (5, 1) (5, 17) (19, 7) (19, 13) (19, 5) (19, 9) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 2) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 10) (0, 15) (0, 11) (6, 7) (6, 17) (6, 16) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 5) (17, 6) (17, 12) (12, 17) (12, 9) (10, 4) (10, 14) (10, 1) (1, 18) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) (16, 4) (16, 6) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 19) (9, 12) (9, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0 - 15 - 3 - 2 - 0
        - Cycle 2: 1 - 10 - 4 - 16 - 1
        - Cycle 3: 5 - 1 - 10 - 14 - 5
        - Cycle 4: 5 - 17 - 6 - 16 - 5
        - Cycle 5: 17 - 18 - 1 - 5 - 17
        - Cycle 6: 6 - 7 - 19 - 5 - 6
        - Cycle 7: 6 - 17 - 5 - 19 - 6
        - Cycle 8: 6 - 17 - 8 - 14 - 6
        - Cycle 9: 8 - 14 - 11 - 0 - 8
        - Cycle 10: 8 - 13 - 19 - 5 - 8
        - Cycle 11: 8 - 17 - 6 - 16 - 8
        - Cycle 12: 9 - 7 - 14 - 11 - 9
        - Cycle 13: 9 - 13 - 8 - 14 - 9
        - Cycle 14: 9 - 19 - 5 - 1 - 9
        - Cycle 15: 9 - 1 - 18 - 17 - 9
        - Cycle 16: 12 - 17 - 8 - 13 - 12

Step 2: Checking for one chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 3 has one chord: <1, 14>
        - Cycle 4 has one chord: <5, 16>
        - Cycle 5 has one chord: <1, 10>
        - Cycle 6 has one chord: <6, 19>
        - Cycle 7 has one chord: <6, 17>
        - Cycle 8 has one chord: <8, 14>
        - Cycle 9 has one chord: <0, 11>
        - Cycle 10 has one chord: <13, 19>
        - Cycle 11 has one chord: <6, 16>
        - Cycle 12 has one chord: <9, 14>
        - Cycle 13 has one chord: <13, 8>
        - Cycle 14 has one chord: <1, 5>
        - Cycle 15 has one chord: <1, 17>
        - Cycle 16 has one chord: <8, 13>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Putting it all together: [14]
        Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        <1, 14, 5, 16>
        <5, 16, 6, 17>
        <5, 1, 10, 14>
        <6, 19, 7, 14>
        <6, 17, 5, 19>
        <8, 14, 11, 0>
        <13, 19, 9, 1>
        <1, 10, 4, 16>
        <13, 8, 14, 9>
        <9, 14, 7, 11>
        <6, 16, 4, 10>
        <17, 5, 1, 9>
        <1, 17, 18, 5>
        <8, 13, 19, 5>
