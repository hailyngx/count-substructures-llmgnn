Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (3, 11) (3, 7) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 12) (13, 11) (13, 4) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the given graph. We need to list them out.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: {10, 1, 6, 7, 10}
- Cycle 2: {10, 1, 2, 11, 10}
- Cycle 3: {10, 5, 12, 7, 10}
- Cycle 4: {9, 11, 3, 7, 9}
- Cycle 5: {9, 11, 2, 1, 9}
- Cycle 6: {9, 11, 14, 10, 9}
- Cycle 7: {9, 14, 12, 5, 9}
- Cycle 8: {12, 7, 3, 11, 12}
- Cycle 9: {12, 7, 1, 2, 12}
- Cycle 10: {12, 5, 10, 1, 12}
- Cycle 11: {5, 10, 1, 2, 5}

Note: We've listed cycles with 4 or more nodes, as per the definition.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1: <10, (1, 6), 7>
- Cycle 2: <10, (1, 11), 2>
- Cycle 3: <10, (5, 12), 7>
- Cycle 4: <9, (11, 3), 7>
- Cycle 5: <9, (11, 2), 1>
- Cycle 6: <9, (11, 14), 10>
- Cycle 7: <9, (12, 5), 14>
- Cycle 8: <12, (7, 3), 11>
- Cycle 9: <12, (7, 1), 2>
- Cycle 10: <12, (5, 10), 1>
- Cycle 11: <5, (10, 1), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph. Therefore, the count is [0].
