- Cycle 6: (3, 6, 0, 7)
- Cycle 7: (3, 6, 0, 1)
- Cycle 8: (3, 6, 0, 1, 9)
- Cycle 9: (3, 17, 8, 16, 12)
- Cycle 10: (3, 17, 16, 12, 11)
- Cycle 11: (3, 17, 16, 12, 11, 15)
- Cycle 12: (10, 19, 7, 0)
- Cycle 13: (10, 19, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 14: (10, 19, 7, 0, 1, 9)
- Cycle 15: (10, 19, 15, 11)
- Cycle 16: (10, 19, 15, 11, 6)
- Cycle 17: (10, 19, 15, 11, 5)
- Cycle 18: (10, 19, 18, 5)
- Cycle 19: (10, 19, 18, 5, 11)
- Cycle 20: (10, 3, 17, 16)
- Cycle 21: (10, 3, 17, 16, 12)
- Cycle 22: (10, 3, 17, 16, 12, 11)
- Cycle 23: (10, 3, 17, 16, 13)
- Cycle 24: (10, 3, 6, 0)
- Cycle 25: (10, 3, 6, 0, 7)
- Cycle 26: (10, 3, 6, 0, 1)
- Cycle 27: (10, 3, 6, 0, 1, 9)

Step 2: Identify the chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, 17, 16, 12, (10)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <10, 19, 7, 0, (1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <10, 19, 15, 11, (6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <10, 19, 18, 5, (11)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <10, 3, 6, 0, (1)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [22]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<3, 17, 16, 12, (10)>
<10, 19, 7, 0, (1)>
<10, 19, 15, 11, (6)>
<10, 19, 18, 5, (11)>
<10, 3, 6, 0, (1)>
