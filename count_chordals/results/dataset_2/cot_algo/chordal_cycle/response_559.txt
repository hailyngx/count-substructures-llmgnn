Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (16, 8) (16, 2) (16, 6) (6, 16) (6, 9) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (9, 13) (10, 11) (10, 18) (10, 4) (8, 16) (8, 9) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 3) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 5) (14, 1) (14, 15) (1, 14) (1, 17) (17, 13) (17, 1) (17, 18) (19, 15) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 16) (2, 7) (12, 0) (12, 19) (12, 3) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 7) (7, 19) (7, 2) (7, 3) (5, 0) (5, 4) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 19) (15, 18) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 5) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

1. Cycle <0, 3, 13, 9>
2. Cycle <0, 3, 12, 19>
3. Cycle <0, 4, 9, 6>
4. Cycle <0, 4, 6, 16>
5. Cycle <0, 4, 5, 14>
6. Cycle <1, 14, 15, 9>
7. Cycle <1, 14, 17, 13>
8. Cycle <2, 7, 19, 15>
9. Cycle <2, 7, 3, 13>
10. Cycle <4, 5, 0, 3>
11. Cycle <4, 5, 0, 12>
12. Cycle <4, 5, 14, 1>
13. Cycle <6, 9, 13, 17>
14. Cycle <6, 9, 15, 14>
15. Cycle <6, 9, 15, 18>
16. Cycle <7, 3, 13, 17>
17. Cycle <7, 3, 12, 19>
18. Cycle <9, 13, 17, 18>
19. Cycle <10, 4, 6, 9>
20. Cycle <10, 4, 5, 0>
21. Cycle <10, 4, 5, 14>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, 3, 12, 19> with chord (3, 12)
- <4, 5, 0, 3> with chord (0, 3)

Step 3:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
