Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 17) (6, 18) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 0) (9, 12) (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 20) (17, 6) (17, 9) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 23) (3, 17) (3, 11) (25, 4) (25, 22) (12, 9) (12, 27) (12, 2) (27, 12) (27, 18) (27, 7) (1, 26) (26, 1) (26, 8) (22, 25) (22, 5) (24, 4) (24, 13) (21, 0) (5, 22) (5, 13) (5, 28) (13, 24) (13, 5) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 2) (2, 12) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 23) (2, 16) (8, 26) (8, 28) (28, 5) (28, 8) (28, 19) (28, 15) (29, 7) (7, 14) (7, 27) (7, 29) (0, 9) (0, 21) (0, 11) (0, 18) (20, 14) (20, 4) (18, 6) (18, 27) (18, 0) (18, 15) (16, 9) (16, 13) (16, 2) (16, 23) (16, 19) (23, 17) (23, 2) (23, 16) (15, 28) (15, 18) (15, 4) (4, 25) (4, 24) (4, 20) (4, 15) (4, 10) (10, 13) (10, 4) (19, 28) (19, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
         - Cycle 1: (6, 9, 17, 6)
         - Cycle 2: (9, 17, 14, 7, 9)
         - Cycle 3: (9, 17, 3, 11, 0, 9)
         - Cycle 4: (9, 16, 13, 5, 22, 25, 4, 9)
         - Cycle 5: (13, 16, 19, 28, 8, 26, 1, 26, 8, 28, 19, 16, 13)
         - Cycle 6: (13, 16, 19, 28, 5, 22, 25, 4, 10, 13)
         - Cycle 7: (15, 28, 19, 16, 2, 23, 17, 3, 11, 0, 21, 15)

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
         - Cycle 1 has a chord: <1, 7>
         - Cycle 2 has a chord: <0, 14>
         - Cycle 3 has a chord: <9, 17>
         - Cycle 4 has a chord: <5, 13>
         - Cycle 5 has a chord: <26, 8>
         - Cycle 6 has a chord: <4, 25>
         - Cycle 7 has a chord: <15, 28>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
         - There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
