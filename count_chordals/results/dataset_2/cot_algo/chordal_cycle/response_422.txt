Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 7) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 0) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Identifying cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 7, 10, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 11, 7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 8, 7, 11, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 1, 4, 11, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 1, 5, 13, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 1, 8, 7, 3)
- Cycle 7: (4, 1, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 7, 8, 1, 4)
- Cycle 9: (5, 1, 4, 11, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 1, 8, 7, 5)
- Cycle 11: (5, 3, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 3, 13, 7, 5)
- Cycle 13: (7, 1, 8, 11, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 4, 11, 1, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 4, 10, 2, 7)
- Cycle 16: (10, 2, 5, 3, 10)
- Cycle 17: (11, 7, 4, 10, 11)
- Cycle 18: (13, 5, 3, 1, 13)

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles from the cycles mentioned above:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (10, 4), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (11, 7), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (8, 7), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, (1, 4), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, (8, 7), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, (1, 8), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (1, 8), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <10, (2, 5), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <11, (4, 10), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <13, (3, 1), 5>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore, the answer is [10].
