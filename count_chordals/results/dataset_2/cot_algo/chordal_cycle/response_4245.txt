- Cycle 33: 2-7-4-1-2
- Cycle 34: 2-3-6-4-2

Step 2:
The cycles that have exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6, (4, 7), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, (9, 2), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, (7, 2), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <6, (4, 3), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6, (1, 5), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (0, 8), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <9, (6, 4), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <9, (6, 2), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, (7, 0), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <4, (7, 2), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <4, (3, 6), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <4, (1, 9), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <7, (4, 1), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <7, (4, 2), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <7, (9, 1), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <1, (9, 6), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <1, (4, 7), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <1, (4, 2), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <1, (5, 7), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 20: <3, (6, 4), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 21: <3, (4, 7), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 22: <3, (2, 6), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 23: <8, (6, 4), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 24: <8, (6, 5), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 25: <8, (0, 7), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 26: <5, (6, 2), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 27: <5, (1, 9), 6>
