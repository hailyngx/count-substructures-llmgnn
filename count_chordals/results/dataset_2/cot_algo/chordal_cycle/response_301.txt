Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the given graph are: <0, 5, 1, 7>, <0, 5, 1, 9>, <0, 5, 3, 1>

Step 2: 
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 5, 1, 7> has one chord: (1, 3)
- <0, 5, 1, 9> has one chord: (1, 3)
- <0, 5, 3, 1> has one chord: (3, 6)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Thus, the final answer is [0].
