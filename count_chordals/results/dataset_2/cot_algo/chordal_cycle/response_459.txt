Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 5) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 12) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 0) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 10) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 6) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 9) (7, 1) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 10) (4, 1) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (6, 14) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 4) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-7-11-3-2-13-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-8-6-14-12-4-11-0
- Cycle 3: 0-11-4-12-14-6-8-5-13-2-0
- Cycle 4: 3-2-13-5-11-4-12-14-6-3
- Cycle 5: 3-6-14-12-4-11-7-0-5-13-3
- Cycle 6: 3-9-7-11-0-5-13-3
- Cycle 7: 5-8-6-13-7-11-4-12-5
- Cycle 8: 5-11-4-9-3-13-7-0-5
- Cycle 9: 5-13-7-9-4-12-14-6-5
- Cycle 10: 7-11-4-12-6-14-1-7
- Cycle 11: 7-13-6-14-12-4-11-0-7
- Cycle 12: 12-4-11-7-1-14-6-13-5-12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <0, (5, 13), 3, 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 12 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
