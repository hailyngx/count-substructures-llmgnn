Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 19) (17, 16) (17, 8) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 15) (8, 17) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 15) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 19) (14, 15) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 11) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 13) (3, 9) (11, 1) (11, 19) (11, 18) (19, 10) (19, 14) (19, 11) (19, 2) (16, 17) (16, 5) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 15) (2, 19) (2, 9) (15, 4) (15, 0) (15, 14) (15, 9) (5, 12) (5, 16) (5, 18) (18, 11) (18, 5) (13, 10) (13, 4) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (1, 8, 0, 15, 14, 1)
        - Cycle 2: (1, 8, 4, 13, 6, 1)
        - Cycle 3: (2, 9, 3, 2)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 12, 1, 6, 13, 10, 19, 14, 15, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 12, 1, 7, 12, 14, 0, 15, 5)
        - Cycle 6: (5, 12, 7, 1, 6, 13, 10, 19, 2, 9, 15, 5)
        - Cycle 7: (5, 12, 7, 1, 8, 0, 15, 9, 2, 19, 10, 13, 6, 1, 5)
        - Cycle 8: (5, 12, 7, 1, 11, 18, 5)
        - Cycle 9: (5, 12, 14, 0, 8, 1, 11, 18, 5)
        - Cycle 10: (8, 0, 15, 9, 2, 19, 11, 18, 5, 16, 17, 8)
        - Cycle 11: (8, 1, 12, 14, 0, 15, 9, 2, 19, 11, 18, 5, 16, 17, 8)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        From the listed cycles above, we can see that Cycle 6: (5, 12, 7, 1, 6, 13, 10, 19, 2, 9, 15, 5) has one chord (6, 15).
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        The number of chordal 4-cycles for the given graph is [0].
        
Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <6, 15>.
