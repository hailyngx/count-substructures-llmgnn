Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 16) (8, 11) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 18) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 13) (11, 17) (5, 19) (5, 14) (19, 5) (19, 14) (19, 9) (15, 4) (15, 16) (15, 17) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 10) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 0) (12, 14) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 1) (10, 16) (10, 2) (10, 18) (10, 9) (17, 3) (17, 11) (17, 15) (17, 18) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 5) (14, 19) (14, 12) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 4) (9, 19) (9, 10) (9, 14) (13, 11) (13, 6) (18, 3) (18, 0) (18, 10) (18, 17) (1, 7) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4 - 7 - 2 - 10 - 4
- Cycle 2: 4 - 9 - 19 - 14 - 4
- Cycle 3: 4 - 15 - 16 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 4: 4 - 15 - 17 - 3 - 4
- Cycle 5: 4 - 15 - 17 - 11 - 4
- Cycle 6: 4 - 9 - 10 - 16 - 4
- Cycle 7: 4 - 9 - 14 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 8: 4 - 15 - 17 - 18 - 4
- Cycle 9: 7 - 2 - 10 - 16 - 7
- Cycle 10: 7 - 2 - 10 - 18 - 7
- Cycle 11: 7 - 4 - 15 - 16 - 7
- Cycle 12: 7 - 4 - 15 - 17 - 7
- Cycle 13: 7 - 1 - 0 - 2 - 7

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Only Cycle 1 <4, 10, 2, 7> has exactly one chord: (4, 10).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<4, 10, 2, 7>
