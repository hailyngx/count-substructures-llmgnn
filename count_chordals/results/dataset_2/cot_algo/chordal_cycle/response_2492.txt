Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 21) (9, 20) (1, 21) (1, 29) (1, 20) (1, 14) (21, 9) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 12) (3, 25) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 19) (25, 3) (25, 23) (25, 22) (26, 11) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 27) (11, 3) (11, 26) (11, 6) (11, 23) (11, 8) (4, 9) (4, 27) (4, 13) (27, 6) (27, 4) (27, 14) (27, 23) (16, 21) (16, 28) (28, 16) (28, 15) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 20) (15, 28) (15, 22) (15, 24) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 18) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 24) (17, 7) (23, 25) (23, 11) (23, 27) (23, 18) (0, 17) (2, 9) (2, 10) (12, 21) (12, 6) (12, 8) (29, 1) (7, 3) (7, 17) (7, 8) (8, 11) (8, 12) (8, 7) (14, 1) (14, 27) (14, 20) (22, 25) (22, 15) (20, 9) (20, 1) (20, 10) (20, 14) (18, 13) (18, 23) (19, 3) (19, 13) (24, 15) (24, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-21-1-5
- Cycle 2: 3-25-22-15-3
- Cycle 3: 6-11-8-7-6
- Cycle 4: 4-9-21-12-4
- Cycle 5: 27-6-12-8-27

Step 2:
Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- For Cycle 1: <1, 16>
- For Cycle 2: <3, 24>
- For Cycle 3: <3, 17>
- For Cycle 4: <4, 27>
- For Cycle 5: <6, 11>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5-9-21-1, (1, 16)>
<3-25-22-15, (3, 24)>
<6-11-8-7, (3, 17)>
<4-9-21-12, (4, 27)>
<27-6-12-8, (6, 11)>
