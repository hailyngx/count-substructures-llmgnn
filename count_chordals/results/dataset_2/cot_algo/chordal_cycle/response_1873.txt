Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 27) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 13) (16, 14) (3, 25) (3, 12) (25, 3) (25, 5) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 27) (10, 5) (1, 23) (17, 29) (17, 13) (29, 17) (29, 23) (29, 22) (29, 14) (21, 9) (28, 24) (28, 2) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 23) (4, 0) (4, 20) (18, 4) (18, 26) (18, 23) (18, 24) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 26) (26, 18) (26, 7) (26, 14) (13, 16) (13, 17) (13, 19) (13, 6) (14, 16) (14, 29) (14, 26) (14, 8) (14, 9) (6, 0) (6, 13) (6, 8) (24, 28) (24, 18) (24, 2) (2, 28) (2, 7) (2, 24) (12, 3) (12, 19) (15, 11) (15, 19) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 12) (19, 15) (5, 25) (5, 10) (5, 27) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 22) (23, 1) (23, 29) (23, 4) (23, 18) (20, 4) (9, 21) (9, 14) (9, 27) (27, 11) (27, 10) (27, 5) (27, 9) (22, 29) (22, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 13, 6, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 16, 14, 29, 23, 4, 19, 13, 11)
- Cycle 3: (11, 16, 14, 9, 21, 9, 14, 29, 17, 13, 16, 11)
- Cycle 4: (11, 16, 14, 8, 6, 13, 16, 11)
- Cycle 5: (11, 16, 14, 8, 22, 29, 17, 13, 16, 11)
- Cycle 6: (11, 10, 0, 4, 19, 13, 17, 29, 23, 11)
- Cycle 7: (11, 10, 0, 4, 23, 18, 26, 7, 2, 24, 28, 2, 7, 0, 10, 11)
- Cycle 8: (11, 10, 5, 25, 3, 25, 5, 27, 9, 14, 27, 11)
- Cycle 9: (11, 15, 19, 12, 3, 25, 5, 27, 9, 21, 9, 14, 16, 11)
- Cycle 10: (11, 27, 9, 21, 9, 14, 29, 17, 13, 19, 4, 0, 10, 27, 11)
- Cycle 11: (11, 27, 9, 21, 9, 14, 16, 13, 19, 4, 0, 10, 5, 27, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (14, 9), 21, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The number of chordless cycles found is [11].
