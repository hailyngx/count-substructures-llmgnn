Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 3 - 4 - 5
2. Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 8 - 5
3. Cycle 3: 5 - 7 - 3 - 5
4. Cycle 4: 9 - 4 - 0 - 6 - 9
5. Cycle 5: 9 - 3 - 1 - 0 - 9
6. Cycle 6: 6 - 8 - 5 - 2 - 6
7. Cycle 7: 3 - 1 - 8 - 4 - 3
8. Cycle 8: 3 - 0 - 4 - 8 - 3

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <5, 9, 4, 3> has one chord (9, 3): <5, (9, 3), 4, 3>
- Cycle 2 <5, 4, 8, 5> has one chord (4, 8): <5, 4, (8, 5), 8>
- Cycle 4 <9, 4, 0, 6> has one chord (4, 6): <9, 4, (0, 6), 6>
- Cycle 5 <9, 3, 1, 0> has one chord (3, 1): <9, 3, (1, 0), 0>
- Cycle 7 <3, 1, 8, 4> has one chord (1, 8): <3, (1, 8), 4, 3>
- Cycle 8 <3, 0, 4, 8> has one chord (0, 4): <3, 0, (4, 8), 3>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<5, (9, 3), 4, 3>
<5, 4, (8, 5), 8>
<9, 4, (0, 6), 6>
<9, 3, (1, 0), 0>
<3, (1, 8), 4, 3>
