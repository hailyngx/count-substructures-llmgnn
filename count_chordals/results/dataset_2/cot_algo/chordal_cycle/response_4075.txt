Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 2) (15, 25) (15, 5) (27, 15) (12, 22) (12, 8) (0, 20) (0, 9) (0, 22) (0, 2) (20, 0) (20, 22) (20, 6) (1, 26) (1, 8) (1, 7) (26, 1) (26, 14) (26, 2) (26, 17) (4, 16) (18, 11) (18, 6) (28, 29) (28, 16) (28, 13) (29, 28) (29, 5) (29, 3) (29, 14) (16, 4) (16, 28) (16, 7) (16, 3) (25, 15) (25, 23) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 10) (14, 26) (14, 29) (14, 11) (14, 24) (14, 10) (11, 18) (11, 14) (11, 21) (5, 15) (5, 29) (5, 23) (23, 25) (23, 5) (23, 19) (8, 12) (8, 1) (2, 15) (2, 0) (2, 26) (2, 3) (9, 0) (9, 24) (21, 11) (3, 29) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 3) (10, 22) (10, 24) (17, 26) (17, 24) (17, 19) (24, 14) (24, 9) (24, 10) (24, 17) (13, 28) (13, 6) (6, 20) (6, 18) (6, 13) (22, 12) (22, 0) (22, 20) (22, 10) (19, 23) (19, 17) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <15, 27, 5, 23>
- <12, 22, 0, 20>
- <1, 26, 2, 3>
- <1, 26, 17, 19>
- <26, 2, 0, 20>
- <26, 2, 3, 10>
- <26, 17, 19, 23>
- <18, 11, 21, 17>
- <29, 5, 23, 19>
- <16, 3, 2, 26>
- <16, 7, 1, 26>
- <16, 4, 18, 6>
- <16, 28, 13, 6>
- <11, 21, 17, 19>
- <5, 29, 14, 24>
- <5, 23, 19, 17>
- <0, 20, 22, 10>
- <0, 22, 12, 8>
- <7, 1, 26, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <15, 27, 5, 23> has a chord (15, 5) 
- <12, 22, 0, 20> has a chord (12, 20)
- <1, 26, 2, 3> has a chord (1, 2)
- <1, 26, 17, 19> has a chord (1, 17)
- <26, 2, 0, 20> has a chord (26, 0)
- <26, 2, 3, 10> has no chord
- <26, 17, 19, 23> has no chord
- <18, 11, 21, 17> has a chord (18, 21)
- <29, 5, 23, 19> has a chord (29, 23)
- <16, 3, 2, 26> has a chord (16, 26)
- <16, 7, 1, 26> has no chord
- <16, 4, 18, 6> has a chord (4, 18)
- <16, 28, 13, 6> has no chord
- <11, 21, 17, 19> has no chord
- <5, 29, 14, 24> has no chord
- <5, 23, 19, 17> has a chord (5, 19)
- <0, 20, 22, 10> has a chord (0, 22)
- <0, 22, 12, 8> has a chord (0, 12)
- <7, 1, 26, 2> has a chord (7, 26)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [9]

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<15, 27, 5, 23>
<12, 22, 0, 20>
<1, 26, 2, 3>
<1, 26, 17, 19>
<18, 11, 21, 17>
<29, 5, 23, 19>
<16, 4, 18, 6>
<0, 20, 22, 10>
<7, 1, 26, 2>
