Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 18) (9, 2) (14, 5) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 4) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 15) (8, 2) (3, 12) (11, 19) (0, 10) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 17) (1, 13) (1, 19) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 4) (13, 17) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 16) (16, 17) (16, 13) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 18) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 10) (18, 5) (18, 9) (18, 10) (19, 11) (19, 1) (19, 15) (19, 4) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are: 
1. (5, 14, 4, 15)
2. (5, 7, 17, 13)
3. (5, 14, 6, 13)
4. (5, 18, 9, 2)
5. (6, 14, 4, 15)
6. (6, 13, 17, 7)
7. (6, 14, 5, 7)
8. (6, 12, 3, 2)
9. (9, 18, 10, 12)
10. (9, 2, 8, 3)
11. (10, 0, 12, 6)
12. (10, 12, 3, 2)
13. (13, 17, 16, 13)
14. (13, 6, 12, 3)
15. (13, 1, 19, 15)
16. (14, 6, 12, 3)
17. (14, 5, 7, 17)
18. (14, 17, 16, 13)
19. (15, 2, 9, 18)
20. (15, 19, 1, 13)
21. (17, 14, 5, 7)
22. (17, 7, 5, 18)
23. (17, 13, 1, 19)
24. (17, 16, 13, 1)
25. (18, 5, 14, 4)
26. (18, 9, 2, 8)
27. (18, 10, 12, 6)
28. (19, 1, 13, 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
1. <5, (14, 4), 15>
2. <6, (13, 17), 7>
3. <6, (12, 3), 14>
4. <9, (2, 8), 18>
5. <10, (12, 3), 6>
6. <13, (1, 19), 15>
7. <14, (5, 7), 17>
8. <15, (2, 9), 18>
9. <17, (13, 1), 19>
10. <18, (5, 14), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There were 28 cycles listed in Step 1. The number of chordal 4-cycles found in Step 2 is 10. Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is 28 - 10 = [18].
