Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <1, (3, 2), 5> (Chord: 2-3)
- <1, (6, 5), 2> (Chord: 5-6)
- <1, (7, 9), 5> (Chord: 7-9)
- <1, (4, 9), 5> (Chord: 4-9)
- <1, (6, 7), 5> (Chord: 6-7)
- <1, (2, 3), 6> (Chord: 2-3)
- <1, (4, 9), 6> (Chord: 4-9)
- <1, (2, 7), 6> (Chord: 2-7)
- <1, (7, 5), 8> (Chord: 5-7)
- <3, (5, 7), 2> (Chord: 5-7)
- <6, (5, 1), 7> (Chord: 1-5)
- <6, (2, 8), 5> (Chord: 2-8)
- <7, (5, 9), 2> (Chord: 5-9)
- <8, (3, 1), 7> (Chord: 1-3)
- <9, (1, 6), 4> (Chord: 1-6)

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: [14]
