Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 4) (16, 10) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 5) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 10) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 18) (13, 8) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 18) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 8) (4, 10) (2, 11) (2, 19) (18, 8) (18, 13) (18, 15) (0, 9) (5, 17) (5, 19) (5, 7) (19, 17) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 5) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 15) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 6) (10, 16) (10, 3) (10, 4) (9, 11) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 8) (6, 12) (6, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more
- Cycle <11, 3, 10, 16, 11> of length 4
- Cycle <11, 4, 8, 13, 9, 11> of length 5
- Cycle <11, 4, 10, 3, 11> of length 4
- Cycle <11, 2, 19, 5, 17, 9, 11> of length 6
- Cycle <16, 4, 8, 13, 9, 17, 16> of length 6
- Cycle <3, 10, 4, 8, 13, 9, 3> of length 6
- Cycle <8, 13, 9, 17, 19, 2, 8> of length 6
- Cycle <13, 9, 0, 9, 13> of length 4
- Cycle <4, 11, 16, 10, 4> of length 4
- Cycle <4, 8, 6, 15, 18, 4> of length 6
- Cycle <2, 11, 4, 8, 13, 18, 2> of length 6
- Cycle <18, 13, 9, 0, 9, 12, 18> of length 7
- Cycle <5, 17, 9, 13, 18, 15, 6, 5> of length 8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord
- Only cycle <11, 4, 8, 13, 9, 11> has exactly one chord <4, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, hence the result is [1].
