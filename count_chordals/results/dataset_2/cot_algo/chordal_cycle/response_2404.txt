Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 8) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 4) (11, 14) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 2) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 11) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 1-2-9-14-1
- Cycle 2: 1-12-4-8-1
- Cycle 3: 1-12-4-13-1
- Cycle 4: 3-1-12-4-3
- Cycle 5: 3-1-14-9-3
- Cycle 6: 3-1-14-11-3
- Cycle 7: 4-8-5-9-4
- Cycle 8: 4-12-1-14-4
- Cycle 9: 4-12-9-2-4
- Cycle 10: 4-13-3-7-4
- Cycle 11: 4-13-6-9-4
- Cycle 12: 6-9-2-1-6
- Cycle 13: 6-9-10-0-6
- Cycle 14: 6-9-14-4-6
- Cycle 15: 7-3-1-14-7
- Cycle 16: 7-3-13-4-7
- Cycle 17: 8-5-9-6-8
- Cycle 18: 8-14-3-13-8
- Cycle 19: 9-2-0-7-9
- Cycle 20: 9-2-6-10-9
- Cycle 21: 10-0-7-3-10
- Cycle 22: 10-13-4-12-10
- Cycle 23: 10-13-6-9-10
- Cycle 24: 11-14-1-12-11

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal cycle 1: Cycle 12 <1, 6, (9, 2)>
- Chordal cycle 2: Cycle 13 <6, 4, (9, 2)>
- Chordal cycle 3: Cycle 21 <10, 3, (0, 7)>
- Chordal cycle 4: Cycle 22 <10, 12, (4, 13)>

Final count of chordal 4-cycles: [4]
