Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (15, 14) (15, 17) (2, 9) (2, 13) (18, 15) (18, 4) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 16) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (4, 18) (4, 6) (4, 19) (4, 11) (19, 5) (19, 4) (1, 13) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 16) (16, 5) (16, 12) (16, 10) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (0, 3) (0, 9) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 17) (14, 15) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 9) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 14) (10, 6) (10, 16) (17, 15) (17, 11) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

By inspecting the given edges, we can identify the following cycles of length 4 or more:
1. Cycle: 3 - 15 - 18 - 4 - 3
2. Cycle: 5 - 14 - 6 - 4 - 5
3. Cycle: 5 - 16 - 12 - 6 - 5
4. Cycle: 4 - 6 - 12 - 1 - 4
5. Cycle: 7 - 11 - 17 - 15 - 7
6. Cycle: 9 - 14 - 5 - 16 - 9
7. Cycle: 9 - 14 - 6 - 12 - 9
8. Cycle: 9 - 14 - 7 - 13 - 9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

After checking each cycle, we find that the following cycles have exactly one chord:
1. Cycle: 3 - 15 - 18 - 4 - 3 (Chord: 15 - 4)
2. Cycle: 5 - 16 - 12 - 6 - 5 (Chord: 16 - 6)
3. Cycle: 9 - 14 - 6 - 12 - 9 (Chord: 14 - 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<3, 15, 4, 18, (15, 4)>
<5, 16, 6, 12, (16, 6)>
<9, 14, 6, 12, (14, 12)>
