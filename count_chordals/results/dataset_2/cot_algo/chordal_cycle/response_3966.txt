Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- The cycles in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 4 - 5 - 8 - 4
2. Cycle 2: 4 - 6 - 5 - 4
3. Cycle 3: 4 - 3 - 8 - 4
4. Cycle 4: 4 - 2 - 0 - 8 - 4
5. Cycle 5: 8 - 0 - 2 - 4 - 8
6. Cycle 6: 8 - 1 - 0 - 2 - 8
7. Cycle 7: 5 - 6 - 4 - 5
8. Cycle 8: 6 - 3 - 4 - 6
9. Cycle 9: 0 - 7 - 1 - 8 - 0
10. Cycle 10: 0 - 9 - 2 - 4 - 0
11. Cycle 11: 7 - 1 - 8 - 3 - 7
12. Cycle 12: 1 - 7 - 9 - 0 - 1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
<4, 8, 2, 0>
<8, 1, 7, 0>
<1, 7, 9, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- As we found 3 chordal 4-cycles, the number of chordless cycles is [12].
