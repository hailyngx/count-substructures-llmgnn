- ... (and more)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 2, 7, 27> - Chord: (2, 7)
- <0, 6, 16, 23, 10, 25> - Chord: (6, 10)
- <0, 6, 16, 23, 10, 14> - Chord: (10, 14)
- ... (and more)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 4, 2, 7, 27>, Chord: (2, 7)
<0, 6, 16, 23, 10, 25>, Chord: (6, 10)
<0, 6, 16, 23, 10, 14>, Chord: (10, 14)
