Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 11) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 4) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 2) (13, 4) (13, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 11) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 4) (14, 3) (14, 7) (14, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 10) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 10, 13, 2, 3) with edges (1, 6), (6, 10), (10, 13), (13, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 1).
- Cycle 2: (4, 9, 10, 13, 2, 12) with edges (4, 9), (9, 10), (10, 13), (13, 2), (2, 12), and (12, 4).

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (6, 13).
- Cycle 2 does not have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final count is [1], and the unique chordal 4-cycle is <1, (6, 13), 10, 2)>.
