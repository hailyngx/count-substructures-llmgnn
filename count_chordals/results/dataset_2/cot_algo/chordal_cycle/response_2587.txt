Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 15) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 15) (17, 14) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 2) (17, 7) (8, 11) (8, 18) (13, 3) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 19) (10, 16) (15, 9) (15, 14) (15, 10) (15, 6) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 5) (16, 10) (16, 12) (2, 17) (2, 11) (2, 4) (12, 17) (12, 16) (12, 18) (12, 1) (3, 13) (3, 0) (6, 14) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 15) (7, 17) (4, 2) (19, 14) (19, 13) (19, 10) (18, 8) (18, 12) (18, 11) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 2) (11, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-15-10-5
- Cycle 2: 5-16-12-17-5
- Cycle 3: 5-16-12-18-5
- Cycle 4: 5-1-12-17-5
- Cycle 5: 5-1-12-18-5
- Cycle 6: 5-9-15-6-5
- Cycle 7: 9-15-10-6-9
- Cycle 8: 14-17-2-11-14
- Cycle 9: 14-17-7-6-14
- Cycle 10: 14-19-13-3-14
- Cycle 11: 17-12-16-10-17
- Cycle 12: 17-12-1-10-17

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 15, 10> has exactly one chord: (15, 10) -> <5, (15, 10), 9>
- <5, 16, 12, 17> has exactly one chord: (16, 17) -> <5, (16, 17), 12>
- <5, 16, 12, 18> has exactly one chord: (16, 18) -> <5, (16, 18), 12>
- <5, 1, 12, 17> has exactly one chord: (1, 17) -> <5, (1, 17), 12>
- <5, 1, 12, 18> has exactly one chord: (1, 18) -> <5, (1, 18), 12>
- <5, 9, 15, 6> has exactly one chord: (9, 15) -> <5, (9, 15), 6>
- <9, 15, 10, 6> has exactly one chord: (15, 6) -> <9, (15, 6), 10>
- <14, 17, 2, 11> has exactly one chord: (17, 2) -> <14, (17, 2), 11>
- <14, 17, 7, 6> has exactly one chord: (17, 7) -> <14, (17, 7), 6>
- <14, 19, 13, 3> has exactly one chord: (19, 13) -> <14, (19, 13), 3>
- <17, 12, 16, 10> has exactly one chord: (12, 16) -> <17, (12, 16), 10>
- <17, 12, 1, 10> has exactly one chord: (12, 1) -> <17, (12, 1), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- We found 12 chordal 4-cycles in total.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [12].
