Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 7) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 2) (17, 10) (17, 12) (17, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 16) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (19, 11) (19, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 9) (15, 13) (15, 1) (15, 16) (12, 8) (12, 17) (12, 18) (7, 13) (7, 10) (7, 5) (16, 4) (16, 15) (16, 18) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 11) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 18) (11, 19) (11, 2) (11, 9) (14, 8) (14, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 11) (9, 0) (18, 12) (18, 16) (18, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. (8, 13, 15, 1, 6, 0, 3, 19, 11, 9, 0, 6)
2. (8, 13, 15, 16, 18, 3, 19, 11, 9, 0, 6, 1)
3. (8, 13, 7, 5, 17, 12, 18, 3, 19, 11, 9, 1, 6)
4. (8, 13, 7, 10, 17, 12, 18, 16, 15, 1)
5. (8, 4, 5, 17, 12, 18, 3, 19, 11, 9, 0, 6, 1)
6. (8, 4, 16, 15, 13, 7, 10, 17, 5, 2, 11, 19, 3)
7. (13, 15, 16, 18, 12, 17, 5, 7, 10, 2, 11, 19, 3)
8. (10, 17, 5, 4, 16, 18, 3, 19, 11, 9, 1, 15, 13)
  
Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. (8, 13, 15, 1, 6, 0, 3, 19, 11, 9, 0, 6) - Not chordal
2. (8, 13, 15, 16, 18, 3, 19, 11, 9, 0, 6, 1) - Not chordal
3. (8, 13, 7, 5, 17, 12, 18, 3, 19, 11, 9, 1, 6) - Not chordal
4. (8, 13, 7, 10, 17, 12, 18, 16, 15, 1) - Chordal cycle: <(7, 12)>
5. (8, 4, 5, 17, 12, 18, 3, 19, 11, 9, 0, 6, 1) - Not chordal
6. (8, 4, 16, 15, 13, 7, 10, 17, 5, 2, 11, 19, 3) - Not chordal
7. (13, 15, 16, 18, 12, 17, 5, 7, 10, 2, 11, 19, 3) - Not chordal
8. (10, 17, 5, 4, 16, 18, 3, 19, 11, 9, 1, 15, 13) - Not chordal
  
Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <8, 13, 15, 16> with a chord (7, 12)
