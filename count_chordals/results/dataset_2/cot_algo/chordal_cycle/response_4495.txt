Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (11, 6) (11, 10) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 0) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 13) (4, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 4) 

Response:
Step 1:  
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, including:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-10-5
- Cycle 2: 9-6-11-10-9
- Cycle 3: 6-5-1-4-6
- Cycle 4: 5-1-3-14-5

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord 6-10
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord 6-11
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord 1-4
- Cycle 4 has no chord

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, namely:
<1, (6, 10), 5)> 
<2, (6, 11), 9)> 
<3, (1, 4), 6)> 

Putting the final count inside brackets: [3].
