Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 4) (8, 14) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 7) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 2) (13, 7) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 1) (2, 11) (2, 13) (2, 12) (2, 1) (3, 10) (3, 0) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 11) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 0-5-14-9-8-4-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-3-10-11-2-1-7-14-0
        - Cycle 3: 0-6-12-2-13-7-1-11-4-0
        - Cycle 4: 0-10-6-12-2-13-10-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has one chord: (0, 9)
        - Cycle 2 has one chord: (0, 11)
        - Cycle 3 has one chord: (0, 12)
        - Cycle 4 has one chord: (0, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 0 chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <0, (0, 9), 5, 14, 8>
        <1, (0, 11), 3, 10, 2>
        <2, (0, 12), 6, 13, 7>
        <3, (0, 10), 6, 12, 2>
