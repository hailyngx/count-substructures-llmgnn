Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 11) (8, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 13) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 2) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 10) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 0) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 12) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 12) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 12 - 14 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 1 - 2 - 11 - 7 - 10 - 14 - 12 - 0
- Cycle 3: 2 - 1 - 13 - 3 - 2
- Cycle 4: 2 - 6 - 5 - 3 - 2

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- For Cycle 1: <1, 12> is a chord.
- For Cycle 2: <1, 10> is a chord, <2, 7> is a chord, <11, 12> is a chord.
- For Cycle 3: <1, 3> is a chord, <13, 2> is a chord.
- For Cycle 4: <6, 3> is a chord, <5, 2> is a chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are no chordless cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
