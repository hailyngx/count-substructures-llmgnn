Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 11) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 14) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 14) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 2) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 11) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) 

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-9-6-1
- Cycle 2: 2-3-9-14-2
- Cycle 3: 4-8-5-7-4
- Cycle 4: 2-13-7-4-2
- Cycle 5: 2-13-4-8-2
- Cycle 6: 7-0-10-6-7
- Cycle 7: 12-1-3-9-12
- Cycle 8: 2-11-9-6-2
- Cycle 9: 4-7-13-2-4
- Cycle 10: 5-8-14-9-5
- Cycle 11: 6-10-0-7-6
- Cycle 12: 9-11-2-13-9

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (3, 6), 9> (Cycle 1 with chord 3-6)
- <2, (3, 14), 9> (Cycle 2 with chord 3-14)
- <4, (7, 13), 2> (Cycle 9 with chord 7-13)
- <5, (8, 14), 9> (Cycle 10 with chord 8-14)
- <6, (10, 0), 7> (Cycle 11 with chord 10-0)
- <12, (1, 3), 9> (Cycle 7 with chord 1-12)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]
