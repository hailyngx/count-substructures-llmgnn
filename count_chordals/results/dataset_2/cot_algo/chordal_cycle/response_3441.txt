Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (11, 8) (11, 2) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 6) (13, 2) (13, 10) (10, 9) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 13) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 12) (2, 5) (2, 11) (2, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
    - There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
    - There are no cycles to check for chords.

Step 3:
    - The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].
