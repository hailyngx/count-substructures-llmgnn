Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 14) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 13) (12, 11) (10, 8) (10, 4) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 12) (11, 1) (1, 0) (1, 10) (1, 11) (3, 4) (3, 14) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 6) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 13, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 13, 2, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 2, 13, 12, 9, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 11, 4, 10, 8, 13, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 11, 0, 8, 13, 5)
- Cycle 6: (9, 7, 0, 8, 13, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 2, 13, 12, 11, 5, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5, 9), 6>
- <2, (5, 13), 1>
- <3, (5, 2), 4>
- <4, (5, 11), 5>
- <5, (9, 7), 6>
- <6, (9, 2), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [6].
