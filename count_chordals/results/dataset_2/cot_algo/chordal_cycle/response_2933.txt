Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 7) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 19) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 2) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (18, 4) (18, 15) (18, 16) (18, 0) (13, 19) (13, 6) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 7) (15, 18) (15, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 17) (8, 12) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 1) (7, 6) (0, 18) (0, 3) (3, 10) (3, 0) (3, 19) (17, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (19, 10) (19, 4) (19, 13) (19, 3) (16, 18) (16, 2) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 16) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle with length 4: (5, 9, 10, 11, 5)
2. Cycle with length 4: (4, 18, 15, 1, 4)
3. Cycle with length 4: (7, 9, 10, 3, 7)
4. Cycle with length 4: (18, 4, 14, 2, 18)
5. Cycle with length 4: (8, 5, 7, 1, 8)
6. Cycle with length 4: (0, 18, 15, 1, 0)
7. Cycle with length 4: (3, 10, 9, 5, 3)
8. Cycle with length 4: (19, 10, 3, 0, 19)
9. Cycle with length 4: (16, 18, 15, 1, 16)
10. Cycle with length 4: (2, 14, 4, 18, 2)
11. Cycle with length 4: (11, 10, 9, 5, 11)
12. Cycle with length 4: (12, 11, 10, 3, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Only cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (5, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The number of chordless cycles found is [11].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <5, (5, 11)>
