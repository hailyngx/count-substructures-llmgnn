Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 3) (9, 0) (26, 9) (26, 22) (26, 20) (26, 4) (15, 27) (15, 20) (15, 13) (27, 15) (27, 29) (27, 18) (27, 20) (27, 7) (4, 26) (4, 8) (4, 17) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 14) (8, 25) (8, 22) (20, 26) (20, 15) (20, 27) (20, 12) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 11) (6, 5) (22, 26) (22, 8) (22, 2) (22, 14) (22, 11) (11, 5) (11, 22) (28, 3) (28, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 2) (7, 27) (7, 28) (7, 0) (10, 18) (2, 22) (2, 0) (1, 25) (1, 14) (1, 23) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 28) (3, 16) (16, 0) (16, 3) (16, 24) (16, 13) (24, 16) (24, 13) (24, 19) (24, 25) (19, 24) (29, 27) (14, 8) (14, 22) (14, 1) (12, 20) (12, 5) (12, 13) (23, 1) (23, 17) (23, 13) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 24) (13, 12) (13, 23) (25, 8) (25, 1) (25, 24) (25, 18) (17, 4) (17, 23) (18, 27) (18, 10) (18, 25) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (9, 26, 4, 3, 9)
- Cycle 2: (26, 15, 27, 20, 26)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 22, 26, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 3, 28, 7, 4)
- Cycle 5: (15, 20, 12, 5, 15)
- Cycle 6: (27, 7, 0, 2, 27)
- Cycle 7: (22, 14, 1, 25, 22)
- Cycle 8: (22, 11, 5, 12, 22)
- Cycle 9: (20, 12, 13, 15, 20)
- Cycle 10: (7, 0, 16, 3, 7)
- Cycle 11: (16, 24, 19, 25, 16)
- Cycle 12: (24, 13, 23, 17, 24)
- Cycle 13: (3, 28, 7, 27, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (4, 15), 22>
- <2, (15, 27), 20>
- <3, (8, 26), 4>
- <4, (3, 28), 7>
- <5, (12, 20), 15>
- <6, (0, 2), 7>
- <7, (1, 25), 14>
- <8, (5, 12), 22>
- <9, (13, 15), 20>
- <10, (3, 16), 7>
- <11, (16, 25), 24>
- <12, (13, 23), 24>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final answer is [13].
