Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 9 - 8 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 6 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 3: 2 - 7 - 4 - 3 - 2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 (0 - 5 - 9 - 8 - 4 - 0) has one chord: (9, 4) => Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 4, 9, 5> with chord (9, 4)
- Cycle 2 (1 - 6 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 1) has one chord: (9, 7) => Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 6, 7, 9> with chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 3 (2 - 7 - 4 - 3 - 2) has one chord: (7, 3) => Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, 3, 4, 7> with chord (7, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, we found 3 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count of chordless cycles is [0].
