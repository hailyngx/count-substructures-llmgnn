Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) 

Response:
The graph consists of the following edges:
(5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) 
(9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) 
(4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) 
(7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) 
(1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) 
(3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
(6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) 
(8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) 
(2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) 
(0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6)

Let's now find the chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1 - 5 - 6 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 5 - 6 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 5 - 0 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 9 - 6 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 9 - 3 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 7: 1 - 9 - 7 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 8: 1 - 2 - 3 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 9: 1 - 2 - 6 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 10: 1 - 2 - 8 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 11: 1 - 4 - 6 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 12: 1 - 4 - 0 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 13: 1 - 3 - 9 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 14: 1 - 3 - 8 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 15: 1 - 3 - 7 - 8 - 1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 8 has exactly one chord, which is (3, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There is [1] chordal 4-cycle in the graph.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 2, 3, 9>.
