Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7)

- Cycle: 1-3-8-9-1
- Cycle: 1-8-3-7-0-1
- Cycle: 1-8-5-7-0-1
- Cycle: 1-9-4-2-3-1
- Cycle: 2-3-1-8-2

- Cycle: 4-0-1-9-4
- Cycle: 4-2-3-9-4
- Cycle: 4-9-8-5-7-4
- Cycle: 5-7-0-1-8-5
- Cycle: 5-8-5
- Cycle: 6-4-9-8-7-6
- Cycle: 7-0-1-3-7
- Cycle: 7-2-4-9-7

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal cycle: <0, (1, 3), 2, 0>
- Chordal cycle: <0, (1, 8), 9, 4, 0>
- Chordal cycle: <0, (3, 8), 9, 4, 0>
- Chordal cycle: <0, (7, 5), 8, 9, 4, 0>
- Chordal cycle: <0, (7, 9), 4, 2, 3, 0>
- Chordal cycle: <1, (0, 3), 2, 1>
- Chordal cycle: <1, (3, 2), 4, 1>
- Chordal cycle: <1, (3, 8), 9, 1>
- Chordal cycle: <1, (8, 3), 7, 0, 1>
- Chordal cycle: <1, (8, 5), 7, 0, 1>
- Chordal cycle: <1, (9, 4), 2, 3, 1>
- Chordal cycle: <2, (3, 4), 9, 8, 2>
- Chordal cycle: <3, (0, 1), 8, 3>
- Chordal cycle: <3, (2, 4), 9, 3>
- Chordal cycle: <3, (5, 7), 8, 3>
- Chordal cycle: <4, (0, 1), 9, 4>
- Chordal cycle: <4, (2, 3), 9, 4>
- Chordal cycle: <4, (7, 8), 5, 4>
- Chordal cycle: <5, (7, 0), 1, 8, 5>
- Chordal cycle: <5, 8, 5>
- Chordal cycle: <6, 4, 9, 8, 7, 6>
- Chordal cycle: <7, (0, 1), 3, 7>
- Chordal cycle: <7, (2, 4), 9, 7>

Step 3:
Final count: [23]
