Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle 1: (6, 5, 4, 6) with the edge (5, 4) as chord.
2. Cycle 2: (6, 1, 7, 6) with the edge (1, 7) as chord.
3. Cycle 3: (6, 3, 0, 6) with the edge (3, 0) as chord.
4. Cycle 4: (6, 8, 2, 6) with the edge (8, 2) as chord.
5. Cycle 5: (5, 4, 6, 5) with the edge (4, 6) as chord.
6. Cycle 6: (5, 3, 8, 5) with the edge (3, 8) as chord.
7. Cycle 7: (5, 6, 1, 5) with the edge (6, 1) as chord.
8. Cycle 8: (4, 5, 3, 4) with the edge (5, 3) as chord.
9. Cycle 9: (4, 6, 1, 4) with the edge (6, 1) as chord.
10. Cycle 10: (7, 9, 2, 7) with the edge (9, 2) as chord.
11. Cycle 11: (7, 0, 3, 7) with the edge (0, 3) as chord.
12. Cycle 12: (7, 2, 1, 7) with the edge (2, 1) as chord.
13. Cycle 13: (1, 6, 5, 1) with the edge (6, 5) as chord.
14. Cycle 14: (1, 7, 9, 1) with the edge (7, 9) as chord.
15. Cycle 15: (1, 2, 8, 1) with the edge (2, 8) as chord.
16. Cycle 16: (3, 0, 7, 3) with the edge (0, 7) as chord.
17. Cycle 17: (3, 6, 5, 3) with the edge (6, 5) as chord.
18. Cycle 18: (5, 8, 2, 5) with the edge (8, 2) as chord.
19. Cycle 19: (2, 9, 7, 2) with the edge (9, 7) as chord.
20. Cycle 20: (2, 1, 6, 2) with the edge (1, 6) as chord.
21. Cycle 21: (2, 8, 5, 2) with the edge (8, 5) as chord.
22. Cycle 22: (0, 7, 1, 0) with the edge (7, 1) as chord.

Step 2: Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (6, 1), 5)>
- <2, (6, 2), 8)>
- <3, (6, 3), 7)>
- <4, (6, 4), 5)>
- <5, (4, 5), 3)>
- <6, (7, 6), 1)>
- <7, (8, 7), 2)>
- <8, (1, 2), 9)>
- <9, (7, 9), 2)>
- <10, (7, 0), 3)>
- <11, (1, 0), 7)>
- <12, (5, 6), 1)>
- <13, (5, 3), 8)>
- <14, (6, 1), 7)>
- <15, (6, 4), 5)>
- <16, (6, 5), 1)>
- <17, (5, 4), 6)>
- <18, (3, 0), 7)>
- <19, (6, 5), 4)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles found: [19]
