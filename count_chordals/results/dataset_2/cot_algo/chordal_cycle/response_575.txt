Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 10) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 6) (12, 13) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 9) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 9) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 6) (3, 12) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 0) (14, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (1, 13) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 9) (9, 12) (9, 7) (9, 14) (9, 2) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 14) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 6) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are as follows:
1. (8, 13, 12, 4)
2. (8, 5, 4, 12)
3. (8, 5, 1, 13)
4. (8, 10, 5, 4)
5. (8, 0, 12, 13)
6. (8, 7, 3, 12)
7. (13, 12, 4, 5)
8. (13, 5, 1, 2)
9. (13, 11, 7, 3)
10. (5, 4, 12, 3)
11. (5, 10, 14, 9)
12. (4, 12, 3, 6)
13. (12, 7, 3, 6)
14. (7, 11, 6, 4)
15. (11, 13, 1, 2)
16. (3, 12, 9, 14)
17. (6, 4, 12, 0)
18. (14, 13, 1, 0)
19. (1, 13, 12, 0)
20. (1, 5, 4, 6)
21. (2, 1, 13, 12)
22. (9, 12, 0, 1)
23. (10, 8, 0, 1)
24. (0, 12, 3, 6)

Step 2:
Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <8, 13, 12, 4> has a chord (8, 12)
- <8, 5, 4, 12> has a chord (8, 4)
- <8, 5, 1, 13> has a chord (8, 13)
- <8, 10, 5, 4> has a chord (8, 5)
- <8, 0, 12, 13> has a chord (8, 12)
- <8, 7, 3, 12> has a chord (8, 3)
- <13, 12, 4, 5> has a chord (13, 5)
- <13, 5, 1, 2> has a chord (13, 1)
- <13, 11, 7, 3> has a chord (13, 7)
- <5, 4, 12, 3> has a chord (5, 12)
- <5, 10, 14, 9> has a chord (5, 14)
- <4, 12, 3, 6> has a chord (4, 6)
- <12, 7, 3, 6> has a chord (12, 3)
- <7, 11, 6, 4> has a chord (7, 6)
- <11, 13, 1, 2> has a chord (11, 1)
- <3, 12, 9, 14> has a chord (3, 9)
- <6, 4, 12, 0> has a chord (6, 12)
- <14, 13, 1, 0> has a chord (14, 1)
- <1, 13, 12, 0> has a chord (1, 12)
- <1, 5, 4, 6> has a chord (1, 4)
- <2, 1, 13, 12> has a chord (2, 13)
- <9, 12, 0, 1> has a chord (9, 0)
- <10, 8, 0, 1> has a chord (10, 0)
- <0, 12, 3, 6> has a chord (0, 3)

Step 3:
There are 24 chordal 4-cycles found.
So, the final count is [24].
