This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 16) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 18) (5, 13) (5, 17) (5, 10) (5, 16) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 18) (0, 7) (0, 15) (0, 9) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 19) (15, 0) (15, 16) (15, 6) (15, 17) (16, 1) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 2) (4, 6) (4, 17) (12, 2) (2, 16) (2, 12) (2, 9) (11, 7) (11, 9) (11, 8) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 14) (14, 13) (14, 8) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 15) (6, 4) (19, 3) (19, 7) (19, 10) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 11) (10, 5) (10, 19) (18, 1) (18, 3) (18, 13) (17, 5) (17, 15) (17, 4)

35. Cycle <6, 4, 17, 5>
36. Cycle <6, 7, 11, 8>
37. Cycle <6, 7, 19, 10>
38. Cycle <6, 15, 0, 7>
39. Cycle <6, 15, 16, 1>
40. Cycle <7, 0, 9, 11>
41. Cycle <7, 11, 8, 1>
42. Cycle <7, 11, 8, 14>
43. Cycle <7, 19, 10, 5>
44. Cycle <8, 1, 16, 5>
45. Cycle <8, 11, 7, 0>
46. Cycle <8, 11, 9, 0>
47. Cycle <8, 14, 13, 5>
48. Cycle <9, 0, 7, 6>
49. Cycle <9, 2, 12, 11>
50. Cycle <9, 11, 8, 14>
51. Cycle <10, 5, 16, 1>

57. Cycle <13, 18, 3, 6>
58. Cycle <14, 13, 5, 16>
59. Cycle <15, 0, 7, 11>
60. Cycle <16, 1, 8, 11>
61. Cycle <17, 5, 16, 1>
62. Cycle <18, 1, 8, 14>
63. Cycle <19, 3, 6, 15>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <1, 16, 15, 0> with non-adjacent chord (1, 5)
2. <6, 15, 0, 7> with non-adjacent chord (6, 0)
3. <9, 11, 8, 14> with non-adjacent chord (9, 14)
4. <8, 1, 16, 5> with non-adjacent chord (8, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
