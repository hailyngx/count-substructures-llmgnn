Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 11) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 11) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 12) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (4, 13, 1, 7, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 13, 1, 10, 3, 0, 4)
- Cycle 3: (7, 9, 3, 0, 7)
- Cycle 4: (7, 1, 13, 4, 12, 6, 14, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 1, 13, 5, 11, 12, 6, 14, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 1, 13, 5, 11, 8, 6, 14, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 1, 2, 0, 3, 9, 6, 14, 7)
- Cycle 8: (7, 1, 2, 12, 6, 14, 7)
- Cycle 9: (1, 13, 4, 12, 2, 0, 3, 9, 6, 14, 1)
- Cycle 10: (3, 5, 13, 4, 12, 2, 0, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 5, 13, 14, 0, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, (13, 4), 7, 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
