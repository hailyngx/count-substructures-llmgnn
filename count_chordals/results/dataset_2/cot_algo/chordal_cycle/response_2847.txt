Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 11) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 14) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 10) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 1) (1, 13) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 3) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 8) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 9) (14, 2) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 14) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 0, 2) 
- Cycle 2: (4, 5, 6, 2) 
- Cycle 3: (7, 12, 10, 0) 
- Cycle 4: (7, 8, 14, 2) 
- Cycle 5: (0, 3, 5, 6) 
- Cycle 6: (0, 11, 9, 2) 
- Cycle 7: (2, 14, 8, 3) 
- Cycle 8: (5, 13, 1, 10) 
- Cycle 9: (10, 6, 5, 4) 
- Cycle 10: (10, 3, 8, 7) 
- Cycle 11: (3, 9, 11, 0) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord (0, 2)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (10, 12)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (8, 14)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (9, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <4, 7, 0, 2> (Chord: (0, 2))
- <4, 5, 6, 2> (Chord: (5, 6))
- <7, 12, 10, 0> (Chord: (10, 12))
- <7, 8, 14, 2> (Chord: (8, 14))
- <0, 3, 5, 6> (Chord: (3, 6))
- <0, 11, 9, 2> (Chord: (9, 11))
