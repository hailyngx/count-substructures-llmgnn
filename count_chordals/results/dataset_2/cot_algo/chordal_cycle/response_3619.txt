Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-7-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-9-8-1
- Cycle 3: 1-5-9-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-4-7-1

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (5, 2)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (3, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 7, (5, 9), 4>
<1, 8, (5, 9), 1>
<1, 2, (5, 9), 1>
<3, 7, (4, 1), 3>
