Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 4) (11, 9) (11, 5) (5, 11) (5, 17) (5, 3) (6, 12) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 15) (8, 18) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 16) (7, 19) (7, 18) (7, 9) (16, 7) (16, 17) (16, 4) (1, 14) (1, 19) (1, 9) (1, 12) (9, 11) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 18) (9, 3) (18, 8) (18, 7) (18, 9) (18, 13) (3, 5) (3, 9) (14, 1) (14, 13) (17, 5) (17, 16) (17, 12) (17, 15) (19, 7) (19, 1) (19, 12) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 17) (12, 19) (12, 13) (13, 18) (13, 14) (13, 12) (15, 8) (15, 17) (15, 4) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 2, 8, 18, 9, 7, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 9, 11, 5, 17, 12, 1)
- Cycle 3: (3, 5, 11, 9, 18, 13, 3)
- Cycle 4: (4, 10, 4)
- Cycle 5: (6, 12, 17, 5, 3, 9, 1, 12)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 3 chords: (0, 8), (2, 18), and (18, 7) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (9, 17) => Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, (9, 17), 5>
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (5, 9) => Chordal 4-cycle <3, 5, (5, 9), 11>
- Cycle 4 has 0 chords => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 5 has 3 chords: (6, 17), (12, 5), and (1, 9) => Not a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are <1, 9, (9, 17), 5> and <3, 5, (5, 9), 11>.
