Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 19) (5, 8) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 17) (1, 15) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 13) (3, 2) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 0) (15, 17) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 0) (4, 19) (4, 12) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (11, 9) (11, 1) (14, 12) (14, 18) (7, 1) (7, 10) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 16) (17, 9) (17, 15) (17, 6) (17, 16) (16, 6) (16, 17) (16, 13) (0, 15) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 6) (13, 3) (13, 16) (13, 10) (18, 14) (18, 10) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 11, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 17, 15, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 1, 7, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 19, 4, 12, 5)
- Cycle 5: (1, 11, 9, 17, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 15, 17, 9, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 8, 0, 15, 1)
- Cycle 8: (4, 19, 0, 6, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 12, 10, 14, 4)
- Cycle 10: (12, 10, 7, 1, 12)
- Cycle 11: (12, 14, 18, 10, 12)
- Cycle 12: (13, 3, 2, 10, 13)
- Cycle 13: (13, 16, 6, 0, 13)

Step 2: 
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (5, 9), 11, (9, 17), 1>
- <2, (17, 15), 5, (5, 8), 1>
- <3, (5, 19), 4, (4, 12), 12>
- <4, (0, 6), 4, (4, 12), 12>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore [4].
