Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:

1. Cycle 1: 5 - 6 - 9 - 8 - 5
2. Cycle 2: 5 - 6 - 2 - 7 - 5

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. Cycle 1: <1, (6, 9), 5>
2. Cycle 2: <2, (6, 7), 5>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [2] chordal 4-cycles found.
