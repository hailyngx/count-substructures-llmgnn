Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 10) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (13, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 11) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 13) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 7) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 10) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 2) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 0) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 9, 14, 10, 4, 5)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 9, 1, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 9, 1, 2, 7, 14, 10, 4, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 4, 8, 11, 3, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 6: (5, 4, 8, 0, 13, 2, 1, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 7: (5, 4, 10, 2, 1, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 8: (5, 8, 4, 10, 2, 13, 0, 11, 3, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 9: (5, 8, 4, 10, 0, 13, 2, 1, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 10: (5, 1, 6, 3, 8, 4, 10, 2, 13, 0, 11, 5)
        - Cycle 11: (5, 1, 6, 3, 8, 11, 0, 13, 2, 10, 4, 5)
        - Cycle 12: (5, 1, 2, 13, 0, 8, 4, 10, 6, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 13: (5, 1, 2, 13, 0, 11, 8, 4, 10, 6, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 14: (5, 1, 2, 10, 12, 13, 0, 8, 4, 6, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 15: (5, 1, 9, 6, 3, 8, 4, 10, 2, 13, 0, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <(5, 9, 6, 5), (5, 1)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <(5, 9, 14, 10, 4, 5), (5, 9)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <(5, 9, 1, 6, 5), (9, 1)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <(5, 4, 8, 11, 3, 6, 5), (5, 4)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <(5, 4, 10, 2, 1, 6, 5), (5, 4)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <(5, 8, 4, 10, 2, 13, 0, 11, 3, 6, 5), (5, 8)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <(5, 1, 2, 13, 0, 8, 4, 10, 6, 9, 5), (5, 1)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordless cycles is [7].
