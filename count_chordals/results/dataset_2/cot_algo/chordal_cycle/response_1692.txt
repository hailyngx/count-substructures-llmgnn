Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 9) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 7) (6, 9) (6, 10) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 13) (14, 19) (14, 5) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 2) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 17) (13, 8) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 16) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 19) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 5) (1, 11) (1, 16) (1, 5) (11, 1) (11, 19) (19, 14) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 7) (19, 12) (2, 17) (2, 10) (16, 17) (16, 4) (16, 1) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 19) (7, 18) (18, 7) (5, 3) (5, 14) (5, 10) (5, 1) (12, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (3, 5, 14, 19)
- Cycle 2: (3, 9, 17, 13)
- Cycle 3: (15, 3, 9, 6)
- Cycle 4: (15, 7, 8, 13)
- Cycle 5: (6, 9, 13, 8)
- Cycle 6: (6, 10, 2, 17)
- Cycle 7: (9, 3, 15, 7)
- Cycle 8: (9, 17, 2, 10)
- Cycle 9: (9, 13, 8, 4)
- Cycle 10: (14, 19, 0, 8)
- Cycle 11: (17, 9, 13, 8)
- Cycle 12: (17, 2, 10, 6)
- Cycle 13: (17, 13, 8, 4)
- Cycle 14: (8, 13, 9, 3)
- Cycle 15: (8, 4, 16, 1)
- Cycle 16: (8, 7, 15, 3)
- Cycle 17: (13, 8, 4, 16)
- Cycle 18: (4, 8, 7, 15)
- Cycle 19: (4, 16, 1, 5)
- Cycle 20: (0, 8, 13, 9)
- Cycle 21: (0, 10, 2, 17)
- Cycle 22: (0, 19, 14, 5)
- Cycle 23: (10, 6, 9, 3)
- Cycle 24: (10, 2, 17, 13)
- Cycle 25: (10, 5, 1, 16)
- Cycle 26: (1, 11, 19, 14)
- Cycle 27: (16, 4, 8, 0)
- Cycle 28: (7, 15, 3, 9)
- Cycle 29: (7, 8, 13, 9)
- Cycle 30: (18, 7, 15, 3)
- Cycle 31: (5, 3, 9, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <3, (5, 14), 19>
- <3, (9, 17), 13>
- <15, (7, 8), 13>
- <6, (9, 13), 8>
- <6, (10, 2), 17>
- <9, (3, 15), 7>
- <9, (13, 8), 4>
- <14, (19, 0), 8>
- <17, (9, 13), 8>
- <17, (2, 10), 6>
- <8, (13, 9), 3>
- <8, (4, 16), 1>
- <8, (7, 15), 3>
- <13, (8, 4), 16>
- <4, (8, 7), 15>
- <4, (16, 1), 5>
- <0, (8, 13), 9>
- <0, (10, 2), 17>
- <0, (19, 14), 5>
- <10, (6, 9), 3>
- <10, (2, 17), 13>
- <1, (11, 19), 14>
- <16, (4, 8), 0>
- <7, (15, 3), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found. 

There are 24 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [24].
