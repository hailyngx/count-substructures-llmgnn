  - Cycle 20: <9, 19, 7, 11>
  - Cycle 21: <9, 19, 13, 10>
  - Cycle 22: <10, 0, 15, 4>
  - Cycle 23: <10, 13, 19, 4>
  - Cycle 24: <10, 12, 14, 6>
  - Cycle 25: <11, 7, 19, 4>
  - Cycle 26: <12, 15, 9, 19>
  - Cycle 27: <12, 14, 6, 8>
  - Cycle 28: <12, 18, 17, 16>
  - Cycle 29: <13, 10, 12, 14>

  - Cycle 36: <17, 18, 2, 8>
  - Cycle 37: <19, 13, 10, 0>

Step 2:
  - Chordal 4-cycles:
    - <0, 10, 12, 15> (Chord: 10-12)
    - <0, 3, 2, 18> (Chord: 3-18)
    - <1, 4, 19, 9> (Chord: 4-9)
    - <1, 6, 14, 12> (Chord: 6-14)
    - <2, 8, 6, 1> (Chord: 8-6)
    - <2, 18, 13, 10> (Chord: 18-13)
    - <4, 19, 13, 10> (Chord: 19-13)
    - <6, 14, 12, 18> (Chord: 14-12)
    - <7, 11, 7, 19> (Chord: 11-7)
    - <9, 19, 13, 10> (Chord: 19-13)

Step 3:
  - There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [10].
