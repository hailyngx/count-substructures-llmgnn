Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<5, 9, 1, 3>
<5, 9, 3, 4>
<5, 9, 7, 4>
<5, 9, 7, 3>
<5, 7, 9, 1>
<5, 7, 9, 3>
<5, 7, 4, 3>
<5, 7, 4, 9>
<9, 7, 4, 3>
<9, 7, 4, 5>
<9, 3, 4, 7>
<9, 3, 4, 5>
<7, 4, 3, 9>
<7, 4, 3, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 9, 1, 3> - Chord: (9, 1)
<5, 9, 3, 4> - Chord: (9, 4)
<5, 9, 7, 4> - Chord: (9, 7)
<5, 7, 9, 3> - Chord: (7, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, 9, 1, 3>
<5, 9, 3, 4>
<5, 9, 7, 4>
<5, 7, 9, 3>
