Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 7, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 6, 3, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 5, 6, 3, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 2, 7, 4, 9)
- Cycle 6: (6, 5, 4, 1, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 3, 8, 1, 6)
- Cycle 8: (1, 5, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 9: (3, 6, 5, 4, 3)
- Cycle 10: (4, 5, 1, 7, 4)
- Cycle 11: (7, 9, 2, 0, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 1, 0, 2, 7)
- Cycle 13: (8, 3, 6, 5, 8)
- Cycle 14: (8, 1, 7, 0, 8)
- Cycle 15: (2, 9, 0, 1, 2)
- Cycle 16: (0, 9, 2, 7, 0)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with a single chord:
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 7, 4, 5) <(1, 4)>
- Cycle 5: (9, 2, 7, 4, 9) <(2, 7)>
- Cycle 8: (1, 5, 4, 7, 1) <(4, 7)>
- Cycle 10: (4, 5, 1, 7, 4) <(5, 1)>
- Cycle 11: (7, 9, 2, 0, 7) <(9, 2)>
- Cycle 12: (7, 1, 0, 2, 7) <(1, 2)>

Step 3:
Counting chordless cycles:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [6].
