The edges are as follows: (0, 16) (0, 8) (0, 2) (27, 2) (27, 9) (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 24) (14, 29) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 25) (17, 18) (17, 21) (10, 11) (10, 20) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 23) (11, 24) (11, 29) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 26) (6, 5) (6, 21) (6, 12) (6, 13) (21, 17) (21, 6) (21, 28) (28, 21) (28, 7) (28, 13) (28, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (8, 0) (8, 9) (8, 20) (8, 16) (9, 27) (9, 8) (23, 11) (23, 24) (23, 12) (15, 28) (15, 16) (15, 22) (15, 4) (16, 0) (16, 8) (16, 15) (18, 17) (18, 19) (18, 1) (26, 5) (26, 3) (25, 17) (24, 14) (24, 11) (24, 23) (24, 4) (3, 26) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 4) (7, 28) (7, 3) (7, 20) (4, 15) (4, 24) (4, 3) (12, 6) (12, 23) (20, 10) (20, 8) (20, 7) (1, 18) (1, 2) (2, 0) (2, 27) (2, 1) (29, 14) (29, 11) (22, 15) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 28) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- (0, 2, 1, 18, 19, 5, 6, 13, 14, 17, 21, 6, 5, 19, 18, 17, 14, 11, 10, 20, 7, 28, 15, 22, 15, 16, 8, 0)
- (0, 2, 27, 9, 8, 16, 15, 22, 15, 28, 21, 17, 14, 13, 6, 21, 17, 25, 18, 1, 2)
- (0, 2, 1, 18, 25, 17, 21, 6, 13, 14, 11, 24, 4, 3, 26, 5, 19, 18, 17)
- (0, 8, 20, 10, 11, 14, 13, 6, 5, 26, 3, 4, 15, 16, 8)
- (0, 8, 20, 7, 28, 21, 17, 14, 13, 6, 5, 19, 18, 17, 21, 6, 13, 3, 26, 5, 19, 18, 1, 2, 27, 9)
- (0, 8, 9, 27, 2, 1, 18, 19, 5, 6, 13, 14, 17, 21, 28, 15, 16)
- (0, 16, 15, 22, 15, 28, 21, 17, 14, 13, 6, 5, 19, 18, 25, 17, 14, 11, 10, 20, 7, 3, 26, 5, 19, 18, 1, 2)
- (0, 16, 8, 9, 27, 2, 1, 18, 19, 5, 6, 13, 14, 17, 21, 28, 7)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- The cycle (0, 2, 27, 9, 8, 16, 15, 22, 15, 28, 21, 17, 14, 13, 6, 21, 17, 25, 18, 1, 2) has exactly one chord: (2, 27)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
The unique chordal 4-cycle is <0, (2, 27), 1>.
