Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 17) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 27) (20, 29) (20, 18) (20, 22) (20, 2) (25, 6) (25, 24) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 21) (8, 7) (5, 12) (6, 25) (6, 24) (6, 14) (6, 15) (28, 29) (28, 26) (28, 13) (29, 20) (29, 28) (29, 26) (29, 12) (2, 20) (2, 27) (26, 28) (26, 29) (26, 17) (0, 7) (0, 22) (0, 23) (7, 16) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 15) (1, 13) (1, 27) (15, 6) (15, 1) (15, 17) (21, 8) (21, 19) (21, 12) (17, 11) (17, 26) (17, 15) (24, 25) (24, 6) (24, 9) (14, 6) (22, 20) (22, 0) (22, 27) (9, 4) (9, 24) (9, 10) (9, 23) (23, 0) (23, 9) (23, 19) (27, 16) (27, 2) (27, 1) (27, 22) (27, 13) (12, 5) (12, 29) (12, 21) (3, 4) (3, 10) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 18) (10, 19) (18, 20) (18, 10) (18, 13) (19, 21) (19, 23) (19, 10) (13, 28) (13, 1) (13, 27) (13, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 4-8-21-12-4
- Cycle 2: 6-25-24-9-6
- Cycle 3: 6-25-24-6
- Cycle 4: 6-14-15-1-6
- Cycle 5: 20-29-12-21-20
- Cycle 6: 20-29-12-5-20
- Cycle 7: 20-29-26-28-20
- Cycle 8: 20-29-26-17-20
- Cycle 9: 8-21-12-29-8
- Cycle 10: 8-21-12-5-8
- Cycle 11: 8-21-12-29-26-28-8
- Cycle 12: 8-21-12-29-26-17-8
- Cycle 13: 8-21-12-5-20-29-26-17-8
- Cycle 14: 8-21-12-5-20-29-26-28-8
- Cycle 15: 6-24-9-23-6
- Cycle 16: 20-22-0-23-20
- Cycle 17: 20-2-27-22-20
- Cycle 18: 29-26-17-15-29
- Cycle 19: 27-1-15-17-27
- Cycle 20: 27-22-0-23-27
- Cycle 21: 27-2-20-29-27
- Cycle 22: 27-26-28-13-27
- Cycle 23: 12-5-20-22-12
- Cycle 24: 12-21-8-4-12

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <4, 8, 21, 12> with chord 8-21
- <6, 25, 24, 9> with chord 25-24
- <6, 25, 24, 6> with chord 25-24
- <6, 14, 15, 1> with chord 14-15
- <20, 29, 12, 21> with chord 29-12
- <20, 29, 26, 17> with chord 29-26
- <8, 21, 12, 29> with chord 12-29
- <8, 21, 12, 5> with chord 21-12
- <8, 21, 12, 29, 26, 28> with chord 12-29
- <8, 21, 12, 5, 20, 29> with chord 12-29
- <6, 24, 9, 23> with chord 24-9
- <20, 22, 0, 23> with chord 22-0
- <20, 2, 27, 22> with chord 2-27
- <27, 1, 15, 17> with chord 1-15
- <27, 2, 20, 29> with chord 2-20
- <27, 26, 28, 13> with chord 26-28
- <12, 5, 20, 22> with chord 5-20

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we get [16].
