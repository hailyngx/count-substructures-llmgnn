Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 17) (27, 24) (27, 28) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 24) (22, 23) (22, 6) (23, 22) (23, 17) (23, 3) (23, 9) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 29) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (1, 20) (1, 5) (26, 14) (26, 29) (26, 6) (26, 17) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 16) (0, 21) (14, 26) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (20, 15) (20, 1) (20, 18) (20, 28) (20, 16) (7, 12) (7, 25) (12, 10) (12, 14) (12, 7) (25, 7) (25, 6) (5, 1) (5, 19) (5, 3) (19, 8) (19, 5) (16, 0) (16, 20) (16, 29) (21, 0) (21, 9) (21, 2) (24, 27) (24, 11) (24, 2) (29, 8) (29, 26) (29, 16) (9, 23) (9, 21) (9, 3) (13, 6) (18, 20) (18, 6) (18, 28) (28, 27) (28, 20) (28, 18) (6, 22) (6, 26) (6, 25) (6, 13) (6, 18) (17, 15) (17, 23) (17, 26) (3, 23) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (2, 14) (2, 21) (2, 24) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-10-12-7-25-6-22-23-17-26-20-1-5-19-8 (length 15)
- Cycle 2: 0-4-10-11-24-27-28-20-1-5-19-8 (length 11)
- Cycle 3: 0-4-10-11-24-2-21-9-23-17-26-20-18-28-27-6 (length 15)
- Cycle 4: 0-4-8-19-5-1-20-15-17-23-9-21-2-14-26-6 (length 15)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has the chord <24, 17>.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (24, 17), 9, 21)>
<2, 24, 27, 6>
<0, 4, 10, 11>
