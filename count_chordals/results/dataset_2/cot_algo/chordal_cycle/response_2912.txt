Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 0) (2, 18) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 4) (18, 2) (18, 11) (4, 2) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 12) (8, 3) (1, 6) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 10) (17, 9) (17, 1) (17, 11) (17, 7) (5, 4) (5, 19) (5, 12) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 0) (15, 2) (15, 1) (11, 18) (11, 17) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 9) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 12) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 3) (10, 1) (16, 8) (16, 1) (7, 2) (7, 17) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 11) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycles of length 4:
    - (8, 4, 5, 12, 8)
    - (17, 9, 14, 11, 17)
    - (2, 18, 11, 14, 9, 2)
    - (12, 5, 19, 13, 3, 12)
    - (1, 6, 9, 17, 1)
    - (1, 16, 8, 4, 2, 15, 1)
    - (0, 9, 14, 11, 0)
    - (4, 2, 18, 11, 0, 4)
    - (2, 18, 11, 17, 7, 2)
    - (5, 4, 8, 16, 1, 15, 5)
    - (12, 5, 4, 2, 15, 1, 16, 12)
    - (13, 19, 0, 11, 14, 9, 17, 7, 13)
    - (3, 8, 16, 1, 10, 3)
    - (3, 12, 11, 18, 2, 7, 17, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The only chordal 4-cycle found is:
    - <1, (2, 4), 15>
    - <1, (1, 14), 11>
    - <2, (9, 11), 18>
    - <5, (12, 15), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
