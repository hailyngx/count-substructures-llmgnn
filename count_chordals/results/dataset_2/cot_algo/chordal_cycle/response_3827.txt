Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 1) (3, 27) (15, 3) (15, 5) (15, 4) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 27) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 25) (9, 10) (9, 16) (9, 23) (1, 3) (1, 22) (1, 12) (20, 25) (20, 18) (20, 2) (20, 19) (25, 9) (25, 20) (25, 18) (21, 13) (21, 14) (21, 4) (28, 26) (28, 16) (28, 22) (26, 28) (26, 10) (16, 9) (16, 28) (16, 18) (5, 15) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 27) (19, 20) (19, 5) (7, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 26) (10, 2) (11, 24) (11, 4) (11, 29) (24, 11) (24, 8) (24, 22) (29, 11) (29, 22) (29, 14) (13, 21) (13, 2) (8, 6) (8, 24) (14, 21) (14, 29) (14, 12) (23, 9) (12, 1) (12, 14) (27, 3) (27, 6) (27, 5) (0, 5) (0, 17) (0, 4) (17, 0) (17, 2) (2, 20) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 17) (18, 20) (18, 25) (18, 16) (4, 15) (4, 21) (4, 11) (4, 0) (22, 1) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 29) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 5, 19, 20, 25, 9, 6, 27, 3)
- Cycle 2: (9, 16, 28, 26, 10, 6, 27, 5, 15, 4, 21, 13, 2, 17, 0, 5, 19, 20, 25, 18, 16, 9)
- Cycle 3: (4, 21, 13, 2, 20, 25, 18, 16, 28, 22, 1, 12, 14, 29, 11, 24, 8, 6, 27, 5)
- Cycle 4: (20, 2, 10, 26, 28, 22, 1, 3, 15, 5, 27, 6, 9, 16, 18, 25, 20)
- Cycle 5: (29, 14, 21, 13, 2, 10, 6, 9, 16, 28, 26, 10, 2, 13, 21, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Chord (5, 25)
- Cycle 2: Chord (9, 28)
- Cycle 3: Chord (1, 29)
- Cycle 4: Chord (20, 22)
- Cycle 5: Chord (2, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
- <3, 15, 5, 19> with chord (5, 25)
- <9, 16, 28, 26> with chord (9, 28)
- <4, 21, 13, 2> with chord (1, 29)
- <20, 2, 10, 26> with chord (20, 22)
- <13, 21, 4, 11> with chord (2, 16)
