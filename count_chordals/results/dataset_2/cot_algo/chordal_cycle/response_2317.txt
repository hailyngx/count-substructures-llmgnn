Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 1) (7, 12) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 10) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 2) (8, 10) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 11) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 0) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 2) (2, 3) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 9) (2, 10) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 11) (0, 9) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 0) (10, 4) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 12, 7, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (4, 7), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
