Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 

Response:
Step 1:

- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 6, 2, 9>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 0, 5>
- Cycle 5: <2, 6, 7, 9>
- Cycle 6: <2, 1, 4, 8>
- Cycle 7: <2, 5, 0, 7>
- Cycle 8: <3, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 9: <3, 6, 7, 0>
- Cycle 10: <4, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle 11: <4, 3, 6, 8>
- Cycle 12: <4, 8, 0, 5>
- Cycle 13: <5, 0, 7, 2>
- Cycle 14: <5, 2, 6, 9>
- Cycle 15: <6, 1, 2, 9>
- Cycle 16: <6, 2, 5, 7>
- Cycle 17: <6, 3, 4, 8>
- Cycle 18: <6, 7, 0, 5>
- Cycle 19: <7, 0, 5, 2>
- Cycle 20: <7, 1, 4, 8>
- Cycle 21: <7, 5, 0, 2>
- Cycle 22: <7, 6, 3, 0>
- Cycle 23: <8, 0, 4, 1>
- Cycle 24: <8, 4, 3, 6>
- Cycle 25: <8, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 26: <8, 9, 2, 1>
- Cycle 27: <9, 2, 1, 6>
- Cycle 28: <9, 7, 0, 5>

Step 2: 
- Chordal 4-cycles with one chord: 
  - <1, 6, 2, 9> with chord (1, 7)
  - <2, 5, 0, 7> with chord (5, 2)
  - <3, 4, 8, 6> with chord (3, 8)
  - <4, 1, 7, 0> with chord (1, 4)
  - <6, 3, 4, 8> with chord (3, 6)
  - <8, 9, 2, 1> with chord (9, 8)

Step 3:
- Number of chordless cycles found: [22]
