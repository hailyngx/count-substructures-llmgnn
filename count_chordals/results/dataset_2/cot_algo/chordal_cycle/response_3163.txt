Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 19) (17, 16) (17, 8) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 15) (5, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 17) (8, 10) (8, 11) (13, 12) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 1) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 15) (4, 5) (4, 19) (4, 15) (12, 13) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 3) (11, 2) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 15) (3, 10) (3, 9) (16, 17) (16, 15) (15, 18) (15, 7) (15, 4) (15, 11) (15, 16) (19, 14) (19, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<0, 7, 11, 2, 5> - Cycle of length 4

<0, 7, 11, 15, 4> - Cycle of length 4

<1, 0, 7, 11, 2> - Cycle of length 4

<1, 0, 7, 15, 4> - Cycle of length 4

<3, 10, 5, 2, 11> - Cycle of length 4

<3, 10, 0, 7, 11> - Cycle of length 4

<4, 5, 2, 11, 8> - Cycle of length 4

<4, 5, 6, 1, 0> - Cycle of length 4

<4, 15, 11, 2, 5> - Cycle of length 4

<9, 14, 7, 11, 2> - Cycle of length 4

<9, 14, 7, 15, 4> - Cycle of length 4

<13, 7, 11, 2, 5> - Cycle of length 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<0, 7, 11, 2, 5> - Chord: (7, 5)

<0, 7, 11, 15, 4> - Chord: (7, 4)

<1, 0, 7, 11, 2> - Chord: (0, 11)

<1, 0, 7, 15, 4> - Chord: (0, 4)

<3, 10, 5, 2, 11> - Chord: (10, 2)

<3, 10, 0, 7, 11> - Chord: (10, 7)

<4, 5, 2, 11, 8> - Chord: (5, 8)

<4, 5, 6, 1, 0> - Chord: (5, 1)

<9, 14, 7, 11, 2> - Chord: (14, 2)

<13, 7, 11, 2, 5> - Chord: (7, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
