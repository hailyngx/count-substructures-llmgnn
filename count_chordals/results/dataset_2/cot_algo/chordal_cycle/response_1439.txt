Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 8) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (14, 0) (14, 4) (14, 2) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 9) (11, 5) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 1) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 1) (12, 6) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 13) (1, 4) (4, 14) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 9) (4, 13) (8, 6) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 13) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 1) (13, 4) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Possible cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 12, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 2, 5, 0)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 11, 3, 5)
- Cycle 4: (0, 9, 3, 13, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 2, 12, 10, 0)
- Cycle 6: (14, 2, 12, 6, 14)
- Cycle 7: (0, 14, 4, 10, 0)
- Cycle 8: (1, 12, 6, 8, 1)
- Cycle 9: (4, 1, 12, 2, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (2, 5), 0> (Cycle 2 with chord 0-2)
- <5, (7, 11), 3> (Cycle 3 with chord 5-11)
- <0, (9, 3), 13> (Cycle 4 with chord 0-3)
- <0, (2, 12), 10> (Cycle 5 with chord 0-12)
- <2, (6, 12), 14> (Cycle 6 with chord 2-12)
- <0, (4, 10), 14> (Cycle 7 with chord 0-14)
- <1, (6, 8), 12> (Cycle 8 with chord 1-8)
- <1, (2, 4), 12> (Cycle 9 with chord 1-4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].
