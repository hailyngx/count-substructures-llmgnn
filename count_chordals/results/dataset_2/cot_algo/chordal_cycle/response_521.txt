Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (5, 16) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 12) (4, 19) (4, 1) (7, 3) (10, 11) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 13) (2, 5) (2, 18) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 0) (18, 13) (0, 2) (0, 18) (0, 14) (0, 1) (0, 19) (14, 10) (14, 0) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 4) (1, 0) (15, 5) (15, 8) (15, 12) (15, 16) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 12) (19, 4) (19, 18) (19, 0) (19, 17) (16, 5) (16, 15) (16, 17) (6, 17) (6, 12) (17, 19) (17, 16) (17, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 8) (12, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle with 4 nodes: (0, 2, 18, 19, 0)
2. Cycle with 4 nodes: (1, 0, 2, 5, 1)
3. Cycle with 4 nodes: (3, 7, 3, 12, 6)
4. Cycle with 4 nodes: (4, 1, 0, 19, 4)
5. Cycle with 4 nodes: (5, 2, 18, 13, 5)
6. Cycle with 4 nodes: (6, 12, 3, 7, 6)
7. Cycle with 4 nodes: (8, 9, 11, 13, 18, 8)
8. Cycle with 4 nodes: (9, 11, 13, 18, 19, 9)
9. Cycle with 4 nodes: (10, 14, 0, 1, 4, 10)
10. Cycle with 4 nodes: (12, 6, 17, 16, 15, 12)
11. Cycle with 4 nodes: (15, 5, 16, 17, 19, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

The cycle with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycle) is:
<0, 2, 5, 1> with chord (0, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There is 10 chordless cycles.

Final result: [1]
