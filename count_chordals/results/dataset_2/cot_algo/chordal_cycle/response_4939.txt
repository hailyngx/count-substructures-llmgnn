Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 8) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 10) (0, 9) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 11) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 9) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- 4-cycle: (1, 3, 13, 8, 1)
- 4-cycle: (1, 8, 12, 14, 1)
- 4-cycle: (1, 8, 4, 11, 1)
- 4-cycle: (3, 1, 6, 5, 3)
- 4-cycle: (3, 13, 8, 4, 3)
- 4-cycle: (8, 1, 6, 2, 8)
- 4-cycle: (8, 13, 4, 2, 8)
- 4-cycle: (8, 4, 11, 14, 8)
- 4-cycle: (13, 3, 1, 6, 13)
- 4-cycle: (13, 8, 4, 11, 13)

- 4-cycle: (6, 5, 0, 4, 6)
- 4-cycle: (6, 7, 12, 14, 6)
- 4-cycle: (7, 5, 0, 10, 7)
- 4-cycle: (7, 6, 1, 8, 7)
- 4-cycle: (7, 12, 14, 11, 7)
- 4-cycle: (7, 14, 1, 3, 7)
- 4-cycle: (12, 8, 13, 4, 12)
- 4-cycle: (12, 7, 10, 0, 12)
- 4-cycle: (0, 4, 13, 8, 0)
- 4-cycle: (0, 5, 6, 1, 0)
- 4-cycle: (0, 9, 3, 13, 0)
- 4-cycle: (14, 1, 8, 12, 14)
- 5-cycle: (14, 1, 8, 13, 4, 14)
- 4-cycle: (14, 7, 12, 8, 14)
- 4-cycle: (14, 11, 4, 8, 14)
- 4-cycle: (2, 8, 1, 6, 2)
- 4-cycle: (2, 4, 8, 13, 2)
- 4-cycle: (2, 6, 1, 8, 2)
- 4-cycle: (10, 0, 5, 6, 10)
- 4-cycle: (10, 7, 12, 8, 10)
- 4-cycle: (10, 9, 3, 1, 10)
- 4-cycle: (11, 4, 8, 12, 11)
- 5-cycle: (11, 4, 13, 8, 2, 11)
- 4-cycle: (11, 6, 1, 14, 11)
- 4-cycle: (11, 9, 3, 13, 11)
- 4-cycle: (9, 3, 1, 8, 9)
- 4-cycle: (9, 0, 5, 6, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 3, 13, 8, 1> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <1, 8, 12, 14, 1> (Chord: (8, 14))
- <1, 8, 4, 11, 1> (Chord: (8, 4))
- <3, 13, 8, 4, 3> (Chord: (13, 4))
- <8, 13, 4, 2, 8> (Chord: (13, 2))
- <13, 3, 1, 6, 13> (Chord: (3, 6))
- <4, 8, 12, 14, 4> (Chord: (8, 12))
- <5, 0, 4, 11, 5> (Chord: (0, 4))
- <6, 1, 8, 12, 6> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <7, 5, 0, 10, 7> (Chord: (5, 0))
- <12, 8, 13, 4, 12> (Chord: (8, 13))
- <14, 1, 8, 12, 14> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <2, 4, 8, 13, 2> (Chord: (4, 13))
- <10, 0, 5, 6, 10> (Chord: (0, 5))
- <11, 4, 8, 12, 11> (Chord: (4, 8))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 15 chordless cycles found in total, thus the final count is [15].
