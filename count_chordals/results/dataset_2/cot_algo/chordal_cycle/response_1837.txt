Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 16) (1, 10) (1, 6) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 4) (9, 16) (9, 12) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 4) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 16) (3, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (19, 2) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 15) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 15) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 3) (16, 14) (16, 9) (16, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: 10-6-1-10
        - Cycle 2: 10-8-7-6
        - Cycle 3: 14-0-16-14
        - Cycle 4: 11-2-5-11
        - Cycle 5: 6-15-13-12-6
        - Cycle 6: 17-18-3-12-17
        - Cycle 7: 5-3-12-9-16-5
        - Cycle 8: 4-6-17-7-15-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1: <1, (6, 10), 10>
        - Cycle 2: <8, (7, 6), 10>
        - Cycle 3: Chordless cycle
        - Cycle 4: <2, (5, 11), 11>
        - Cycle 5: <6, (13, 12), 15>
        - Cycle 6: Chordless cycle
        - Cycle 7: Chordless cycle
        - Cycle 8: Chordless cycle

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        - <14, (0, 16), 14>
        - <17, (18, 3), 12, (3, 5), 16>
        - <4, (6, 17), 7, (17, 15), 4>
        - <5, (2, 3), 12, (3, 16), 5>
