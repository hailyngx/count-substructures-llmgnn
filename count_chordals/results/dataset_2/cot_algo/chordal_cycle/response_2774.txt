Step 2:
Identifying the cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 8, 13, 1) has one chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 16: (7, 12, 2, 13, 7) has one chord: (12, 13)
- Cycle 41: (2, 12, 1, 5, 2) has one chord: (1, 5) 

Step 3: 
Count of unique chordal 4-cycles = [3]
Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, 5, 8, 13, 1>
2. <7, 12, 2, 13, 7>
3. <2, 12, 1, 5, 2>
