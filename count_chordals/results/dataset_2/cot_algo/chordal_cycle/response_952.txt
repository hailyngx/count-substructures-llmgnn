Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 14) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 1) (9, 14) (14, 4) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
From the given graph, we can identify the following cycles of length 4 or more:
1. Cycle: 4 - 11 - 9 - 1 - 4
2. Cycle: 4 - 5 - 2 - 14 - 4
3. Cycle: 7 - 6 - 12 - 8 - 7
4. Cycle: 10 - 11 - 4 - 7 - 10
5. Cycle: 10 - 2 - 5 - 6 - 10

Step 2:
We will now check each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle <4, 11, 9, 1, 4> has one chord (4, 1)
2. Cycle <4, 5, 2, 14, 4> has one chord (4, 14)
3. Cycle <7, 6, 12, 8, 7> has one chord (7, 8)
4. Cycle <10, 11, 4, 7, 10> has one chord (10, 7)
5. Cycle <10, 2, 5, 6, 10> has one chord (10, 5)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0], as all the cycles identified have one chord each.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
