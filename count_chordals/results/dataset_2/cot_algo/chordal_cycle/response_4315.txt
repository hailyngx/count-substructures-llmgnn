Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 11) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 15) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 16) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 11) (18, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 19) (14, 3) (14, 16) (1, 2) (1, 18) (1, 17) (1, 13) (17, 4) (17, 1) (17, 12) (17, 9) (13, 1) (13, 12) (8, 16) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (19, 0) (19, 11) (19, 10) (12, 17) (12, 13) (12, 8) (12, 15) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 8) (16, 9) (11, 4) (11, 18) (11, 0) (11, 19) (11, 5) (3, 14) (3, 8) (6, 8) (15, 7) (15, 2) (15, 12) (9, 17) (9, 16) (10, 19) (10, 5) (5, 0) (5, 11) (5, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

(1) Cycle: 1-2-18-11-4-17-1

(4) Cycle: 0-11-4-17-1-13-12-8-3-14-16-2-1
(5) Cycle: 0-11-4-17-1-13-12-8-16-2-15-7-15-2-1
(6) Cycle: 0-11-4-17-1-13-12-15-2-18-11-0
(7) Cycle: 0-11-4-17-1-13-12-15-7-15-2-18-2-1

(9) Cycle: 0-11-4-17-1-13-12-15-2-16-14-3-8-6-8-16-9-17-12-13-1
(10) Cycle: 0-11-4-17-1-13-12-15-7-15-2-18-11-5-10-19-0
(11) Cycle: 0-11-4-17-1-13-12-15-2-18-11-5-10-19-19-0
(12) Cycle: 0-11-4-17-1-13-12-15-7-15-2-18-11-5-5-10-19-0
(13) Cycle: 0-11-4-17-1-13-12-15-2-16-14-3-8-6-8-16-9-17-12-13-12-15-12
(14) Cycle: 0-11-4-17-1-13-12-15-2-16-14-3-8-6-8-16-9-17-12-13-12-15-7-15-2-1
(15) Cycle: 0-11-4-17-1-13-12-15-7-15-2-18-11-5-10-19-19-0-5
(16) Cycle: 0-11-4-17-1-13-12-15-7-15-2-18-11-5-5-10-19-19-0-11

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

(1) Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (18, 11), 4, 17, 1>
(2) Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (11, 4), 17, 1, 13>
(3) Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (4, 17), 12, 13, 1>
(4) Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (17, 1), 13, 12, 8>
(5) Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (13, 12), 8, 16, 2>
(6) Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (12, 8), 16, 14, 3>
(7) Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (8, 16), 9, 17, 13>
(8) Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (17, 1), 13, 12, 8>
(9) Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (1, 13), 12, 8, 16>
(10) Chordal 4-cycle: <17, (12, 15), 2, 18, 11>
(11) Chordal 4-cycle: <17, (15, 2), 18, 11, 5>
(12) Chordal 4-cycle: <17, (2, 18), 11, 5, 10>
(13) Chordal 4-cycle: <17, (18, 11), 5, 10, 19>
(14) Chordal 4-cycle: <13, (12, 15), 2, 16, 14>
(15) Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (16, 9), 17, 12, 13>
(16) Chordal 4-cycle: <12, (13, 12), 15, 7, 15>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [16].
