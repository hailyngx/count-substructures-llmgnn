Step 2: Check for a single chord in each cycle.

    - Cycle 1 has a chord <1, (2, 5)>
    - Cycle 2 has a chord <2, (9, 4)>
    - Cycle 3 has a chord <2, (9, 24)>
    - Cycle 4 has a chord <9, (1, 24)>
    - Cycle 5 has a chord <7, (1, 28)>
    - ...

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles.

There are a total of [30] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
