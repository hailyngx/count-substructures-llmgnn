Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (2, 5, 3, 6)
- Cycle 2: (2, 5, 9, 6)
- Cycle 3: (2, 5, 9, 4)
- Cycle 4: (2, 5, 3, 7)
- Cycle 5: (2, 9, 6, 8)
- Cycle 6: (2, 9, 4, 6)
- Cycle 7: (2, 9, 4, 0)
- Cycle 8: (2, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 9: (5, 9, 6, 8)
- Cycle 10: (5, 9, 4, 6)
- Cycle 11: (5, 9, 4, 0)
- Cycle 12: (5, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 13: (9, 6, 8, 3)
- Cycle 14: (9, 6, 3, 7)
- Cycle 15: (9, 4, 6, 8)
- Cycle 16: (9, 4, 0, 7)
- Cycle 17: (6, 3, 8, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (5, 4)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (9, 0)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (5, 0)
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 13 has one chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 14 has one chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 15 has one chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 16 has one chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 17 has one chord: (6, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of 17 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Thus, the final answer is [17].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <2, 5, 3, 6> with chord (5, 6).
