Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 15) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 19) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 7) (1, 7) (1, 19) (3, 13) (3, 19) (3, 8) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 12) (17, 18) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 5) (16, 6) (16, 0) (18, 17) (18, 14) (19, 6) (19, 1) (19, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 11) (4, 9) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 15) (15, 6) (15, 0) (15, 7) (15, 11) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 10) (12, 14) (13, 3) (13, 12) (13, 14) (14, 18) (14, 12) (14, 13) (10, 9) (10, 12) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 5) (11, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more by following the edges in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 4 - 10 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 11 - 8 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 3: 6 - 15 - 7 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 4: 6 - 16 - 0 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 5: 6 - 19 - 1 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 6: 9 - 4 - 10 - 12 - 9
- Cycle 7: 9 - 7 - 1 - 19 - 9
- Cycle 8: 1 - 7 - 9 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 9: 1 - 19 - 6 - 16 - 1
- Cycle 10: 3 - 8 - 2 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 11: 3 - 19 - 1 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 12: 2 - 8 - 3 - 13 - 2
- Cycle 13: 2 - 5 - 0 - 16 - 2
- Cycle 14: 8 - 3 - 13 - 12 - 8
- Cycle 15: 8 - 11 - 5 - 2 - 8
- Cycle 16: 17 - 18 - 14 - 12 - 17
- Cycle 17: 0 - 2 - 8 - 11 - 0
- Cycle 18: 0 - 5 - 11 - 15 - 0
- Cycle 19: 16 - 0 - 2 - 8 - 16
- Cycle 20: 18 - 17 - 14 - 12 - 18
- Cycle 21: 18 - 14 - 12 - 10 - 18
- Cycle 22: 19 - 1 - 7 - 15 - 19

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<6, 9, 4, 10> has a chord (6, 10)
<6, 11, 8, 2> has a chord (11, 8)
<6, 15, 7, 1> has a chord (15, 7)
<6, 16, 0, 2> has a chord (16, 2)
<9, 4, 10, 12> has a chord (9, 12)
<9, 7, 1, 19> has a chord (9, 19)
<1, 7, 9, 4> has a chord (1, 9)
<1, 19, 6, 16> has a chord (1, 16)
<3, 8, 2, 5> has a chord (3, 5)
<8, 3, 13, 12> has a chord (8, 13)
<8, 11, 5, 2> has a chord (8, 5)
<17, 18, 14, 12> has a chord (17, 14)
<0, 2, 8, 11> has a chord (0, 11)
<0, 5, 11, 15> has a chord (0, 15)
<16, 0, 2, 8> has a chord (16, 8)
<18, 17, 14, 12> has a chord (18, 14)
<19, 1, 7, 15> has a chord (19, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [16]
