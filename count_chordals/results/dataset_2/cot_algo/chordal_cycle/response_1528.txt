Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 29) (16, 11) (16, 12) (16, 22) (18, 22) (18, 7) (22, 16) (22, 18) (20, 25) (20, 17) (20, 12) (25, 20) (25, 3) (25, 1) (25, 29) (25, 0) (3, 25) (3, 6) (23, 1) (23, 21) (10, 11) (10, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 10) (5, 19) (5, 28) (5, 14) (17, 20) (17, 24) (17, 27) (17, 7) (0, 25) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 21) (7, 18) (7, 17) (7, 0) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 28) (9, 11) (9, 2) (9, 29) (9, 24) (9, 1) (29, 11) (29, 25) (29, 9) (29, 4) (26, 6) (26, 27) (26, 4) (1, 25) (1, 23) (1, 9) (6, 3) (6, 26) (6, 27) (12, 16) (12, 20) (12, 8) (15, 19) (15, 14) (15, 24) (15, 28) (21, 23) (21, 0) (24, 17) (24, 9) (24, 15) (28, 5) (28, 19) (28, 15) (27, 17) (27, 26) (27, 6) (14, 5) (14, 15) (4, 2) (4, 29) (4, 26) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 25, 1, 9, 0>
- Cycle <0, 25, 29, 9, 0>
- Cycle <0, 25, 29, 4, 26, 6, 3, 25, 0>
- Cycle <0, 25, 29, 4, 26, 6, 27, 17, 7, 0>
- Cycle <0, 25, 29, 4, 2, 9, 29, 25, 0>
- Cycle <1, 25, 29, 4, 26, 6, 3, 25, 1>
- Cycle <1, 25, 29, 9, 0, 7, 17, 24, 15, 1>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle <0, 25, 1, 9, 0> is chordal with chord (25, 9)
- Cycle <0, 25, 29, 9, 0> is chordal with chord (25, 9)
- Cycle <0, 25, 29, 4, 26, 6, 3, 25, 0> is chordal with chord (29, 3)
- Cycle <0, 25, 29, 4, 26, 6, 27, 17, 7, 0> is chordal with chord (25, 17)
- Cycle <0, 25, 29, 4, 2, 9, 29, 25, 0> is chordal with chord (4, 29)
- Cycle <1, 25, 29, 4, 26, 6, 3, 25, 1> is chordal with chord (25, 3)
- Cycle <1, 25, 29, 9, 0, 7, 17, 24, 15, 1> is chordal with chord (25, 17)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordless cycles found in the given graph.
