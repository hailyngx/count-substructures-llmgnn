Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 1) (16, 19) (5, 18) (5, 0) (9, 14) (4, 11) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 0) (13, 12) (13, 15) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 8) (10, 17) (10, 12) (17, 3) (17, 10) (17, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 13) (12, 4) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 2) (6, 13) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 18) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 14) (19, 11) (19, 16) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 18) (18, 5) (18, 6) (18, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 3, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 10, 17, 6, 13, 0>
- Cycle 3: <4, 12, 10, 8, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle 4: <5, 18, 15, 6, 13, 0, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 18, 6, 17, 10, 12, 4, 5>
- Cycle 6: <7, 0, 5, 18, 15, 13, 6, 7>
- Cycle 7: <11, 2, 1, 4, 7, 0, 11>
- Cycle 8: <11, 2, 14, 9, 14, 2, 11>
- Cycle 9: <11, 19, 16, 1, 3, 17, 6, 11>
- Cycle 10: <16, 19, 11, 0, 7, 4, 1, 16>

Step 2:
- The cycle 3 <4, 12, 10, 8, 3, 1, 4> has exactly one chord (10, 1).
- The cycle 10 <16, 19, 11, 0, 7, 4, 1, 16> has exactly one chord (11, 1).

Step 3:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord each. So, the final count is [2].
