Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 3 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 2 - 5 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 4 - 5 - 7 - 0

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has two chords: (1, 6), (3, 6)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (2, 5)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (4, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph as all cycles have at least one chord.

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
