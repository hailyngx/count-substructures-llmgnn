Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-1-5
- Cycle 2: 5-3-1-4-5
- Cycle 3: 5-7-3-2-5
- Cycle 4: 5-4-2-0-5
- Cycle 5: 9-6-1-4-9
- Cycle 6: 9-8-1-3-9
- Cycle 7: 6-1-4-0-6
- Cycle 8: 1-4-2-3-1
- Cycle 9: 3-5-7-0-3
- Cycle 10: 3-1-4-2-3
- Cycle 11: 2-4-0-7-2
- Cycle 12: 8-1-3-7-8
- Cycle 13: 0-2-4-7-0
- Cycle 14: 0-6-1-3-0
- Cycle 15: 7-3-1-5-7
- Cycle 16: 7-0-2-4-7
- Cycle 17: 4-5-9-1-4
- Cycle 18: 4-1-3-2-4
- Cycle 19: 4-2-0-6-4
- Cycle 20: 4-0-7-5-4

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the only cycle with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycle) is:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (9, 4), 6>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycle = [1]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
