Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 19) (15, 3) (15, 7) (15, 12) (15, 11) (11, 3) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 12) (1, 17) (1, 8) (17, 1) (17, 6) (17, 5) (17, 18) (0, 11) (0, 6) (7, 15) (8, 1) (8, 12) (9, 18) (9, 14) (16, 5) (16, 10) (12, 15) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 10) (18, 17) (18, 9) (6, 3) (6, 17) (6, 0) (6, 19) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (19, 3) (19, 6) (19, 13) (14, 9) (14, 10) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 14) (10, 5) (13, 4) (13, 19) (13, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 13) (5, 17) (5, 16) (5, 4) (5, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 3-15-12-11-3
- Cycle 2: 3-11-12-15-3
- Cycle 3: 3-6-0-11-3
- Cycle 4: 3-19-13-4-3
- Cycle 5: 15-7-15
- Cycle 6: 11-0-6-17-11
- Cycle 7: 11-12-8-1-11
- Cycle 8: 1-17-6-3-1
- Cycle 9: 1-17-18-9-1
- Cycle 10: 17-5-16-10-17
- Cycle 11: 0-11-12-10-0
- Cycle 12: 7-15-12-8-7
- Cycle 13: 8-1-17-18-8
- Cycle 14: 9-18-17-6-9
- Cycle 15: 9-14-10-12-9
- Cycle 16: 16-5-4-13-16

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: <3, 15, 12, 11>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: <3, 11, 12, 15>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: <11, 0, 6, 17>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: <3, 19, 13, 4>
- Cycle 10 has one chord: <17, 5, 16, 10>
- Cycle 14 has one chord: <9, 18, 17, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [16]

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <3, 15, 12, 11>
- <3, 11, 12, 15>
- <11, 0, 6, 17>
- <3, 19, 13, 4>
- <17, 5, 16, 10>
- <9, 18, 17, 6>
