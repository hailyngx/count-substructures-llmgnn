Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 26) (14, 6) (14, 29) (17, 14) (17, 27) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 12) (1, 27) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 19) (3, 5) (20, 25) (20, 29) (20, 5) (25, 20) (25, 13) (25, 24) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 16) (11, 10) (11, 18) (4, 22) (4, 9) (4, 15) (8, 22) (8, 7) (7, 8) (7, 23) (12, 1) (12, 16) (2, 1) (19, 3) (19, 26) (19, 13) (19, 27) (26, 14) (26, 19) (26, 16) (18, 11) (18, 28) (28, 18) (28, 29) (28, 13) (29, 14) (29, 20) (29, 28) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 23) (15, 6) (22, 4) (22, 8) (22, 16) (16, 10) (16, 12) (16, 26) (16, 22) (16, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (5, 3) (5, 20) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 0) (23, 7) (23, 15) (23, 24) (23, 9) (9, 4) (9, 16) (9, 23) (9, 13) (13, 25) (13, 19) (13, 28) (13, 9) (13, 24) (27, 17) (27, 1) (27, 19) (24, 25) (24, 23) (24, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph. I will list them here:
- Cycle 1: 1 - 3 - 5 - 20 - 29 - 28 - 18 - 11 - 10 - 6 - 0 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 27 - 19 - 26 - 14 - 6 - 0 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 27 - 19 - 26 - 16 - 22 - 8 - 7 - 23 - 15 - 6 - 14 - 17 - 27
- Cycle 4: 1 - 27 - 19 - 26 - 16 - 22 - 4 - 9 - 13 - 28 - 18 - 11 - 10 - 6 - 14 - 17 - 27
- Cycle 5: 3 - 1 - 27 - 19 - 26 - 14 - 17 - 27 - 3
- Cycle 6: 3 - 1 - 27 - 19 - 26 - 16 - 22 - 8 - 7 - 23 - 15 - 6 - 14 - 17 - 27 - 3
- Cycle 7: 3 - 1 - 27 - 19 - 26 - 16 - 22 - 4 - 9 - 13 - 28 - 18 - 11 - 10 - 6 - 14 - 17 - 27 - 3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (27, 26).
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (26, 14).
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (26, 16).
- Cycle 7 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 4 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <1, 27, 19, 26, 14, 17>
2. <1, 27, 19, 26, 16, 22>
3. <3, 1, 27, 19, 26, 14>
4. <3, 1, 27, 19, 26, 16>
