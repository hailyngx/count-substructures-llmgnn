Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 23) (22, 17) (23, 22) (23, 5) (23, 17) (23, 12) (23, 13) (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 14) (25, 20) (25, 1) (25, 8) (25, 28) (12, 23) (12, 27) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 28) (27, 12) (27, 10) (27, 6) (0, 1) (0, 19) (5, 23) (5, 6) (5, 18) (6, 27) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (28, 25) (28, 12) (28, 29) (29, 28) (29, 19) (29, 10) (19, 0) (19, 29) (26, 13) (26, 18) (26, 15) (13, 23) (13, 26) (13, 1) (13, 9) (18, 5) (18, 26) (8, 25) (8, 11) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 21) (10, 27) (10, 29) (21, 9) (21, 4) (21, 24) (4, 12) (4, 21) (11, 8) (11, 24) (24, 21) (24, 11) (24, 14) (15, 26) (15, 7) (15, 16) (3, 6) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 20) (14, 24) (14, 3) (14, 7) (7, 20) (7, 15) (7, 14) (1, 25) (1, 0) (1, 13) (17, 22) (17, 23) (17, 2) (16, 15) (16, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 17) (2, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (22, 23, 12, 27, 6, 5, 23)
- Cycle 2: (23, 12, 27, 6, 5, 23)
- Cycle 3: (23, 12, 4, 21, 24, 14, 20, 25, 1, 13, 26, 18, 5, 6, 27, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
From the cycles listed above, we can identify that Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 have a chord. 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
As there are 2 cycles with exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <<22, 27, 6, 23>>
