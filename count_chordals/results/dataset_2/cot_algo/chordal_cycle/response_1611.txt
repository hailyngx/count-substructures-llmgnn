Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (13, 0, 6, 17, 19, 13)
- Cycle 2: (13, 0, 6, 3, 21, 12, 27, 13)
- Cycle 3: (13, 27, 12, 7, 11, 22, 4, 28, 18, 19, 13)
- Cycle 4: (2, 8, 19, 18, 4, 22, 11, 7, 12, 21, 3, 6, 17, 23, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 8, 5, 1, 10, 0, 6, 17, 19, 8)
- Cycle 6: (3, 6, 0, 10, 2, 23, 7, 12, 27, 13, 19, 18, 9, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 6, 0, 13, 27, 12, 21, 3)
- Cycle 8: (7, 12, 27, 13, 0, 10, 2, 23, 17, 26, 23, 7)
- Cycle 9: (8, 19, 13, 0, 10, 2, 14, 16, 29, 9, 18, 4, 28, 22, 11, 7, 20, 12, 21, 3)
- Cycle 10: (8, 19, 13, 27, 12, 21, 3, 9, 29, 16, 14, 25, 5, 8)
- Cycle 11: (9, 18, 19, 13, 27, 12, 21, 3)
- Cycle 12: (16, 12, 21, 3, 9, 29, 16)
- Cycle 13: (17, 6, 0, 13, 27, 12, 21, 3, 9, 29, 16, 14, 2, 8, 19, 17)
- Cycle 14: (17, 6, 0, 10, 2, 14, 16, 29, 9, 18, 19, 17)
- Cycle 15: (25, 5, 8, 19, 18, 4, 22, 11, 7, 12, 27, 13, 0, 6, 3, 21, 12, 20, 11, 22, 4, 28, 18, 9, 29, 16, 14, 2, 23, 17, 25)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (10, 0), 6, 17, 19>
- <2, (13, 27), 12, 21, 3>
- <3, (7, 11), 22, 4, 28, 18, 19>
- <4, (5, 1), 10, 0, 6>
- <5, (3, 23), 7, 12, 27>
- <6, (8, 2), 19, 18, 4>
- <7, (10, 0), 6, 17, 19>
- <8, (13, 27), 12, 21, 3>
- <9, (7, 11), 22, 4, 28, 18, 19>
- <10, (13, 27), 12, 21, 3>
- <11, (7, 11), 22, 4, 28, 18, 19>
- <12, (14, 16), 29, 9, 18>
- <13, (2, 14), 16, 29, 9>
- <14, (5, 8), 19, 18, 4>
- <15, (23, 17), 26, 7, 11, 22, 4, 28, 18, 9, 29, 16, 14, 2, 25>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Number of unique chordal 4-cycles: [15]
