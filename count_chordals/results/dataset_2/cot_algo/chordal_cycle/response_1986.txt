Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 18) (9, 2) (9, 12) (10, 18) (10, 7) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 18) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 19) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 18) (3, 11) (3, 2) (3, 16) (1, 16) (1, 14) (15, 19) (15, 7) (19, 2) (19, 15) (19, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 6) (16, 8) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 17) (6, 19) (6, 0) (6, 4) (17, 8) (17, 16) (17, 18) (7, 10) (7, 15) (7, 13) (4, 0) (4, 6) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 14) (14, 10) (14, 1) (14, 12) (18, 5) (18, 10) (18, 11) (18, 8) (18, 17) (13, 0) (13, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (8, 2, 9, 12, 14, 1, 16, 8)
- Cycle 2: (8, 16, 3, 2, 9, 12, 14, 8)
- Cycle 3: (16, 3, 2, 9, 12, 14, 1, 16)
- Cycle 4: (2, 9, 12, 14, 10, 18, 17, 8, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 3, 11, 18, 17, 8, 16, 3, 2)
- Cycle 6: (18, 11, 3, 2, 9, 12, 14, 10, 18)
- Cycle 7: (10, 18, 11, 3, 2, 9, 12, 14, 10)
- Cycle 8: (18, 17, 8, 16, 3, 2, 9, 12, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1: Not chordal
- Cycle 2: Not chordal
- Cycle 3: Not chordal
- Cycle 4: <2, 12>
- Cycle 5: <3, 18>
- Cycle 6: Not chordal
- Cycle 7: Not chordal
- Cycle 8: Not chordal

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, which is <2, 12>.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
