Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, 13, 14, 10> has chord (1, 10)
- <1, 13, 14, 5> has chord (1, 5)
- <1, 3, 13, 6> has chord (3, 6)
- <3, 13, 14, 10> has chord (13, 10)
- <3, 13, 14, 5> has chord (13, 5)
- <7, 3, 13, 14> has chord (3, 14)
- <11, 7, 3, 13> has chord (7, 13)
- <10, 14, 5, 9> has chord (14, 9)
- <16, 8, 3, 13> has chord (8, 13)
- <16, 2, 5, 14> has chord (2, 14)
- <16, 12, 15, 1> has chord (12, 1)
- <5, 14, 13, 1> has chord (14, 1)
- <5, 9, 0, 15> has chord (9, 15)
- <5, 16, 12, 15> has chord (16, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [14].
