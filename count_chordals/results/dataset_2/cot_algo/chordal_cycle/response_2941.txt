Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 4) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 4) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 14) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 10) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 3) (12, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 10) (3, 4) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 13) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 2) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 1-10-4-1
        - Cycle 2: 1-10-11-4-1
        - Cycle 3: 1-10-14-13-2-1
        - Cycle 4: 1-10-14-5-2-1
        - Cycle 5: 1-4-11-10-1
        - Cycle 6: 1-4-10-14-13-1
        - Cycle 7: 1-4-14-5-2-1
        - Cycle 8: 1-12-3-13-2-1
        - Cycle 9: 1-12-9-8-10-1
        - Cycle 10: 1-12-9-13-2-1
        - Cycle 11: 1-12-9-13-3-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 8 has exactly one chord, 3-13
        - Cycle 9 has exactly one chord, 9-8
        - Cycle 10 has exactly one chord, 9-13
        - Cycle 11 has exactly one chord, 9-13

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <1, 12, (3, 13), 2>
        <1, 12, (9, 8), 10>
        <1, 12, (9, 13), 2>
        <1, 12, (9, 13), 3>
