Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (20, 25) (20, 7) (20, 26) (20, 9) (25, 20) (25, 17) (25, 23) (25, 18) (8, 13) (8, 27) (13, 8) (13, 23) (15, 2) (15, 24) (6, 28) (6, 2) (6, 27) (6, 19) (28, 6) (28, 21) (17, 25) (17, 29) (17, 11) (17, 26) (29, 17) (29, 5) (29, 22) (0, 9) (0, 21) (14, 18) (14, 1) (14, 5) (21, 28) (21, 0) (21, 10) (21, 22) (10, 21) (10, 2) (10, 9) (16, 22) (16, 3) (16, 26) (2, 15) (2, 6) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 23) (12, 2) (12, 1) (26, 20) (26, 17) (26, 16) (3, 16) (3, 18) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 24) (1, 7) (11, 17) (11, 9) (5, 29) (5, 14) (5, 23) (23, 25) (23, 13) (23, 2) (23, 5) (23, 7) (7, 20) (7, 1) (7, 23) (24, 15) (24, 1) (24, 19) (9, 20) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11) (4, 19) (19, 6) (19, 24) (19, 4) (18, 25) (18, 14) (18, 3) (22, 29) (22, 21) (22, 16) (27, 8) (27, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:  
        - (2, 6, 27, 8, 13, 23)  
        - (2, 6, 27, 8, 13, 23, 5)  
        - (2, 6, 27, 8, 13, 23, 25)  
        - (2, 6, 19, 24, 1, 14, 18)  
        - (2, 10, 21, 28, 6, 27, 8)  
        - (2, 10, 21, 28, 6, 27, 8, 13)  
        - (2, 10, 9, 11, 17, 25, 23)  
        - (2, 23, 13, 8, 27, 6, 28, 21)  
        - (2, 23, 13, 8, 27, 6, 28, 21, 22)  
        - (1, 14, 18, 25, 17, 26, 16)  
        - (1, 14, 5, 29, 22, 16, 26)  
        - (1, 7, 23, 5, 29, 22, 16)  
        - (6, 2, 15, 24, 19, 4, 18)  
        - (6, 2, 10, 21, 0, 9, 20)  
        - (6, 2, 23, 13, 8, 27, 6, 19)  
        - (14, 1, 7, 23, 5, 29, 22)  
        - (14, 5, 29, 22, 16, 26, 17)  
        - (14, 18, 25, 17, 26, 16, 22)  
        - (16, 22, 29, 5, 14, 1, 7)  

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:  
        - <1, (14, 18), 5, (29, 22), 16>  
        - <2, (6, 27), 8, (13, 23), 25>  
        - <2, (10, 21), 28, (6, 27), 8>  
        - <6, 2, 15, (24, 19), 4>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:  
        There are [4] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
