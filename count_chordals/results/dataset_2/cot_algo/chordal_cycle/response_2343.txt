Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- 1-9-5-4-1
- 1-9-5-8-1
- 1-9-2-6-1
- 1-0-4-6-1
- 1-0-4-8-1
- 1-0-8-3-1
- 1-0-8-4-1
- 1-0-7-5-1
- 1-0-7-3-1
- 3-7-0-4-3
- 3-7-1-9-3
- 3-7-1-2-3
- 3-8-4-0-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 9, 5, 4, 1> has a chord (5, 4)
- <1, 9, 5, 8, 1> has a chord (9, 8)
- <1, 9, 2, 6, 1> has a chord (2, 6)
- <1, 0, 4, 6, 1> has a chord (4, 6)
- <1, 0, 4, 8, 1> has a chord (4, 8)
- <1, 0, 8, 3, 1> has a chord (8, 3)
- <1, 0, 8, 4, 1> has a chord (8, 4)
- <1, 0, 7, 5, 1> has a chord (7, 5)
- <1, 0, 7, 3, 1> has a chord (7, 3)
- <3, 7, 0, 4, 3> has a chord (0, 4)
- <3, 7, 1, 9, 3> has a chord (1, 9)
- <3, 7, 1, 2, 3> has a chord (1, 2)
- <3, 8, 4, 0, 3> has a chord (4, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [13]
