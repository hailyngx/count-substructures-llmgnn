Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 1) (26, 19) (26, 15) (26, 0) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 24) (3, 15) (3, 28) (3, 29) (15, 26) (15, 3) (15, 10) (15, 2) (21, 19) (21, 23) (21, 11) (21, 14) (22, 14) (22, 10) (23, 21) (23, 2) (23, 4) (20, 29) (20, 11) (25, 17) (25, 19) (25, 29) (25, 2) (0, 26) (0, 14) (0, 24) (0, 12) (14, 21) (14, 22) (14, 0) (14, 12) (19, 26) (19, 21) (19, 25) (19, 28) (11, 21) (11, 20) (11, 28) (11, 18) (28, 3) (28, 19) (28, 11) (28, 18) (28, 10) (10, 15) (10, 22) (10, 28) (10, 1) (10, 13) (29, 3) (29, 20) (29, 25) (13, 10) (13, 4) (17, 25) (17, 6) (6, 17) (6, 8) (6, 16) (2, 15) (2, 23) (2, 25) (2, 4) (2, 27) (4, 23) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 24) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 14) (24, 5) (24, 0) (24, 4) (18, 11) (18, 28) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 10) (27, 2) (27, 16) (8, 6) (16, 6) (16, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        
        - Cycle 1: (0, 26, 15, 2, 0)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 26, 15, 3, 0)
        - Cycle 3: (0, 24, 4, 2, 0)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 1, 10, 15, 5)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 24, 4, 23, 5)
        - Cycle 6: (2, 15, 3, 28, 2)
        - Cycle 7: (2, 25, 17, 6, 2)
        - Cycle 8: (2, 27, 16, 27, 2)
        - Cycle 9: (11, 21, 19, 25, 11)
        - Cycle 10: (11, 18, 28, 3, 11)
        - Cycle 11: (14, 21, 23, 4, 14)
        - Cycle 12: (14, 0, 26, 19, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (5, 15), 10>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (3, 15), 28>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, (4, 24), 23>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <11, (19, 25), 21>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <14, (0, 26), 21>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

        There are a total of [5] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
