Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-8-9-2-5
- Cycle 2: 5-7-9-2-5
- Cycle 3: 5-4-1-9-5
- Cycle 4: 5-7-1-9-5
- Cycle 5: 5-4-2-9-5
- Cycle 6: 5-7-3-6-5
- Cycle 7: 9-8-3-6-9
- Cycle 8: 4-1-7-3-4
- Cycle 9: 4-2-9-7-4
- Cycle 10: 7-3-8-6-7
- Cycle 11: 1-9-2-4-1
- Cycle 12: 1-7-3-6-1
- Cycle 13: 1-4-2-3-1

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has the chord (1, 9).
- Cycle 4 has the chord (5, 7).
- Cycle 5 has the chord (4, 2).
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has no chord.
- Cycle 8 has no chord.
- Cycle 9 has no chord.
- Cycle 10 has no chord.
- Cycle 11 has the chord (1, 9).
- Cycle 12 has the chord (1, 3).
- Cycle 13 has the chord (1, 3).

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <3, (1, 9), 5>
- <5, (4, 2), 7>
- <5, (5, 7), 4>
- <6, (), 3>
- <13, (1, 3), 1>
