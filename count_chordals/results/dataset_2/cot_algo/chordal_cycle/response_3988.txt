Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 14) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 3) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 12) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 11) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 12) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 0) (14, 5) (14, 7) (14, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. (5, 9, 4, 13, 5)
2. (5, 9, 8, 6, 5)
3. (5, 9, 10, 2, 5)
4. (5, 12, 7, 14, 5)
5. (9, 8, 6, 5, 9)
6. (9, 8, 14, 7, 9)
7. (9, 10, 11, 1, 9)
8. (9, 3, 1, 13, 9)
9. (4, 9, 10, 2, 4)
10. (7, 12, 11, 1, 7)
11. (1, 3, 2, 10, 1)
12. (1, 13, 4, 0, 1)
13. (3, 9, 5, 6, 3)
14. (8, 6, 2, 10, 8)
15. (13, 4, 0, 1, 13)
16. (10, 5, 6, 8, 10)

Step 2: 
Only one of these cycles has exactly one chord (additional edge connecting non-adjacent nodes):
- <9, (4, 13), 5>

Therefore, there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph.

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles found: [0]
