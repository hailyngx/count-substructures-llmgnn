Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 5) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 2) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 8) (8, 7) (8, 11) (8, 9) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 6) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (6, 10) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 7) (14, 1) (14, 9) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 3) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 5) (2, 10) (2, 13) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 10, 6, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 11, 10, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 8, 9, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 1, 13, 2, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 3, 11, 8, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 9, 14, 1, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 12, 5, 6, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 10, 6, 5, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 11, 3, 4, 7)
- Cycle 10: (7, 8, 9, 14, 7)
- Cycle 11: (7, 5, 6, 2, 7)
- Cycle 12: (10, 11, 3, 9, 10)
- Cycle 13: (10, 12, 5, 6, 10)
- Cycle 14: (11, 8, 9, 14, 11)
- Cycle 15: (12, 5, 6, 2, 12)
- Cycle 16: (2, 13, 6, 5, 2)
- Cycle 17: (1, 13, 2, 5, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <4, (7, 10), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (7, 11), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (7, 8), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (1, 13), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, (3, 11), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, (9, 14), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, (12, 5), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <7, (10, 6), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <7, (11, 3), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <7, (8, 9), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <7, (5, 6), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <10, (11, 3), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <10, (12, 5), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <11, (8, 9), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <12, (5, 6), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <2, (13, 6), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <1, (13, 2), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 

There are a total of [0] chordless cycles found.
