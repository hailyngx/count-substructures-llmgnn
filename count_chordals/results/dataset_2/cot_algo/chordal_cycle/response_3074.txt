Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 9) (11, 2) (16, 11) (16, 9) (16, 10) (16, 14) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 15) (13, 8) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 17) (5, 10) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (0, 14) (0, 10) (0, 19) (14, 16) (14, 0) (7, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 6) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 18) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 17) (19, 5) (19, 0) (15, 1) (15, 8) (15, 17) (10, 16) (10, 8) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 2) (9, 11) (9, 16) (9, 18) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 10) (17, 5) (17, 18) (17, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 4, 1) 
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 18, 9) 
- Cycle 3: (4, 18, 17, 15) 
- Cycle 4: (18, 17, 5, 19) 
- Cycle 5: (17, 15, 1, 6) 
- Cycle 6: (5, 10, 16, 9) 
- Cycle 7: (10, 16, 14, 0) 
- Cycle 8: (16, 14, 0, 19) 
- Cycle 9: (0, 14, 16, 11) 
- Cycle 10: (14, 16, 9, 18) 
- Cycle 11: (9, 18, 17, 5) 
- Cycle 12: (18, 17, 15, 8) 
- Cycle 13: (17, 5, 2, 11) 
- Cycle 14: (15, 17, 5, 10) 
- Cycle 15: (8, 15, 1, 3) 
- Cycle 16: (3, 1, 12, 6) 
- Cycle 17: (12, 6, 7, 1) 
- Cycle 18: (6, 7, 1, 4) 
- Cycle 19: (7, 6, 12, 3) 
- Cycle 20: (2, 10, 5, 17) 

Step 2:
- Only Cycle 1: (1, 6, 4, 1) has a chord between vertices 6 and 4.

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph: <1, (6, 4), 1>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles in the graph is [0].
