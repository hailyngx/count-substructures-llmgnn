Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 13) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 3) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 4) (11, 8) (11, 1) (11, 13) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 5) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 1) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph, including:
1. Cycle 1: (7, 12, 4, 3, 7)
2. Cycle 2: (12, 14, 13, 7, 12)
3. Cycle 3: (0, 8, 14, 4, 0)
4. Cycle 4: (8, 2, 4, 3, 8)
5. Cycle 5: (3, 8, 11, 13, 3)
6. Cycle 6: (4, 10, 5, 1, 4)
7. Cycle 7: (10, 3, 13, 11, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the cycles listed above, only Cycle 4: (8, 2, 4, 3, 8) has exactly one chord. The chord is (2, 3).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<4, (2, 3), 8>
