Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph of length 4 or more. Let's list them:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-4-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-9-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-6-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-5-8-4-0
- Cycle 5: 0-7-2-6-0
- Cycle 6: 1-0-5-3-1
- Cycle 7: 1-4-8-5-1
- Cycle 8: 2-6-5-3-2
- Cycle 9: 2-7-4-1-2
- Cycle 10: 3-4-8-6-3
- Cycle 11: 3-5-9-2-3
- Cycle 12: 4-7-2-9-4
- Cycle 13: 5-6-8-4-5
- Cycle 14: 5-9-3-6-5
- Cycle 15: 8-4-7-2-8
- Cycle 16: 8-5-0-6-8

Step 2:
Now, we need to find cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 with a chord 8-4
- Cycle 2 with a chord 5-9
- Cycle 3 with a chord 3-5
- Cycle 4 with a chord 6-2

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 1, 4, (8, 0)>
- <0, 5, 9, (2, 0)>
- <2, 6, (5, 3), 0>
- <3, (6, 2), 5, 9>
