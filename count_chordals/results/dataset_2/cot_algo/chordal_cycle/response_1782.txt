Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 11) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 12) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 13) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 10) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 10) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 2) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 7) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 10) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0-9-13-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-9-7-3-14-0
- Cycle 3: 0-9-12-14-0
- Cycle 4: 0-9-7-2-12-0
- Cycle 5: 0-14-6-1-0
- Cycle 6: 0-14-3-7-9-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (0, 13)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (9, 12)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (14, 6)
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (14, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 9, 13, (0, 13)>
<9, 7, 3, 14, 0>
<9, 12, 14, 0>
<9, 7, 2, 12, 0>
<14, 6, 1, 0>
<14, 3, 7, 9, 0>
