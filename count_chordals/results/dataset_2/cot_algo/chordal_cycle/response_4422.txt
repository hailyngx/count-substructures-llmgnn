Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only one chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 9, 15, 17> with a chord (9, 17).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 68 chordless cycles.

Overall, there is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, so the final count is [1].
