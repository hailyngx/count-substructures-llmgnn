Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 6) (2, 18) (2, 5) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 7) (15, 17) (15, 11) (12, 5) (7, 1) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 13) (16, 8) (16, 7) (16, 5) (19, 18) (19, 14) (19, 3) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 16) (11, 1) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 17) (0, 11) (0, 17) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 13) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 3) (14, 10) (17, 15) (17, 11) (17, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 7) (10, 14) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 9) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 11)

- (16, 8, 6, 18, 2, 5, 12, 16)
- (16, 5, 2, 18, 6, 11, 1, 7, 16)
- (19, 18, 6, 11, 1, 7, 16, 5, 12, 19)
- (19, 14, 3, 13, 7, 1, 11, 6, 18, 19)
- (5, 2, 18, 6, 11, 1, 7, 16, 5)
- (5, 12, 16, 7, 1, 11, 6, 18, 2, 5)
- (11, 1, 7, 16, 5, 12, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordless cycle: <4, 8, 16, 5, 4>
- Cycle with one chord: <4, 13, 7, (1, 11), 6, 18, 2, 5, 12, 4>
- Chordless cycle: <4, 14, 19, 3, 13, 7, 1, 11, 17, 15, 14>
- Cycle with one chord: <8, 16, 7, (1, 11), 6, 18, 2, 5, 16>
- Cycle with one chord: <2, 18, 6, (11, 1), 9, 7, 16, 8, 2>
- Cycle with one chord: <18, 19, 14, (3, 13), 7, 1, 11, 6, 18>
- Chordless cycle: <1, 11, 0, 17, 15, 11>
- Chordless cycle: <15, 17, 0, 11, 1, 7, 16, 5, 12, 15>
- Chordless cycle: <12, 5, 16, 7, 1, 11, 17, 15, 12>
- Cycle with one chord: <7, 1, 11, 0, 17, 15, (11, 6), 18, 2, 5, 16, 7>
- Chordless cycle: <7, 16, 5, 2, 18, 6, 11, 1, 9, 7>
- Chordless cycle: <7, 9, 1, 11, 6, 18, 2, 5, 16, 7>
- Chordless cycle: <7, 13, 3, 14, 19, 18, 6, 11, 1, 7>
- Cycle with one chord: <16, 8, 6, (18, 2), 5, 12, 16>
- Cycle with one chord: <16, 5, 2, (18, 6), 11, 1, 7, 16>
- Chordless cycle: <19, 18, 6, 11, 1, 7, 16, 5, 12, 19>
- Chordless cycle: <19, 14, 3, 13, 7, 1, 11, 6, 18, 19>
- Cycle with one chord: <5, 2, 18, 6, (11, 1), 7, 16, 5>
- Chordless cycle: <5, 12, 16, 7, 1, 11, 6, 18, 2, 5>
- Chordless cycle: <11, 1, 7, 16, 5, 12, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [9] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
