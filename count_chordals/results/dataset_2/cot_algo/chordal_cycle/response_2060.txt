Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 5
        - Cycle 2: 5 - 6 - 4 - 2 - 5
        - Cycle 3: 5 - 1 - 0 - 3 - 5
        - Cycle 4: 9 - 8 - 4 - 0 - 9
        - Cycle 5: 6 - 4 - 0 - 3 - 6
        - Cycle 6: 1 - 0 - 3 - 6 - 1
        - Cycle 7: 8 - 4 - 0 - 1 - 8
        - Cycle 8: 7 - 9 - 8 - 4 - 7
        - Cycle 9: 2 - 4 - 8 - 0 - 2

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has chord (8, 7)
        - Cycle 2 has chord (6, 4)
        - Cycle 3 has chord (1, 0)
        - Cycle 4 has chord (9, 8)
        - Cycle 5 has chord (4, 0)
        - Cycle 6 has chord (3, 6)
        - Cycle 7 has chord (0, 1)
        - Cycle 8 has chord (8, 4)
        - Cycle 9 has chord (8, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
