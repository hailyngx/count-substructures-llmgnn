Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 8) (16, 19) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 15) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 15) (2, 8) (8, 16) (8, 2) (8, 19) (1, 17) (1, 14) (17, 9) (17, 1) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 13) (15, 16) (15, 4) (15, 12) (19, 11) (19, 16) (19, 8) (19, 13) (18, 11) (18, 9) (18, 14) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 13) (10, 12) (10, 3) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (14, 1) (14, 18) (13, 0) (13, 19) (13, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 11-16-19-11
- Cycle 2: 5-9-17-1-5
- Cycle 3: 4-7-12-15-4
- Cycle 4: 0-7-12-10-0
- Cycle 5: 16-8-19-13-16
- Cycle 6: 5-0-7-12-5
- Cycle 7: 9-18-14-1-9
- Cycle 8: 3-10-6-3

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: <11, 19>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: <9, 17>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: <7, 12>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: <10, 12>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: <8, 19>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: <0, 7>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: <18, 14>
- Cycle 8 has one chord: <10, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
