Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 1, 9, 5) 
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 2, 0, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 1, 4, 3, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 3, 6, 2, 8, 9)
- Cycle 6: (4, 0, 1, 8, 9, 4)
- Cycle 7: (1, 8, 2, 6, 3, 1)
- Cycle 8: (3, 6, 0, 2, 8, 3)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <1, 9>
- Cycle 2 has a chord <3, 4>
- Cycle 3 has a chord <0, 4>
- Cycle 4 has a chord <1, 3>
- Cycle 5 has a chord <6, 9>
- Cycle 6 has a chord <1, 9>
- Cycle 7 has a chord <2, 6>
- Cycle 8 has a chord <0, 3>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have [8].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, (1, 9), 4, 1>
<5, (3, 4), 9, 3>
<5, (0, 4), 6, 2>
<9, (1, 3), 4, 9>
<9, (6, 9), 3, 2>
<4, (1, 9), 0, 8>
<1, (2, 6), 8, 3>
<3, (0, 3), 6, 2>
