Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 17) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 5) (10, 17) (10, 7) (17, 1) (17, 10) (17, 13) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 13) (12, 14) (4, 2) (18, 7) (18, 16) (18, 8) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 11) (5, 15) (19, 5) (8, 18) (8, 9) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 6) (0, 1) (0, 16) (0, 6) (0, 2) (16, 18) (16, 0) (16, 15) (15, 5) (15, 16) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 11) (14, 3) (14, 12) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1 - 3 - 5 - 11 - 2 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 3 - 14 - 12 - 2 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 3 - 5 - 19 - 2 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 9 - 2 - 4 - 2 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 9 - 13 - 7 - 18 - 16 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 9 - 13 - 11 - 5 - 15 - 16 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 7: 1 - 17 - 10 - 7 - 18 - 16 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 8: 1 - 17 - 13 - 11 - 5 - 15 - 16 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 9: 1 - 17 - 10 - 7 - 13 - 11 - 5 - 3 - 1

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord (5, 11)
- Cycle 2 has chord (3, 12)
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has chord (2, 4)
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has no chord
- Cycle 7 has no chord
- Cycle 8 has chord (5, 15)
- Cycle 9 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 4 chordless 4-cycles, so [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<3, (3, 12), 14, 1)>
<4, (2, 4), 9, 1)>
<6, 9, 13, 11)>
<7, (1, 18), 10, 17)>
