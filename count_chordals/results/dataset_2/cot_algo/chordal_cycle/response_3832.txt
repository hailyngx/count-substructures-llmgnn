Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 13) (5, 10) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 2) (7, 10) (7, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 3) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 0) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (13, 5) (13, 2) (13, 1) (13, 0) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 14) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 1) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 1) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 0) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

We will now list all the cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 2-3-8-7-10-12-4-9-6-2
- Cycle 2: 2-3-8-11-14-6-9-4-12-10-2
- Cycle 3: 0-1-2-3-11-14-6-9-4-12-10-0
- Cycle 4: 0-1-13-5-10-12-4-9-6-2-0
- Cycle 5: 0-1-13-2-6-9-4-12-10-7-0
- Cycle 6: 0-1-13-5-10-8-11-14-6-2-0
- Cycle 7: 0-3-2-6-9-4-12-10-13-0
- Cycle 8: 0-3-8-14-6-9-4-12-10-13-0
- Cycle 9: 0-3-8-11-9-6-2-13-1-0
- Cycle 10: 0-11-3-8-14-6-9-4-12-10-0
- Cycle 11: 0-13-2-6-9-4-12-10-14-1-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, (1, 13), 5>
<0, (3, 8), 11>
<2, (3, 8), 14>
<2, (6, 9), 4>
<3, (2, 6), 13>
<10, (5, 7), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [5] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
