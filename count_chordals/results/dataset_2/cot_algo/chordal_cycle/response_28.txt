Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 5) (6, 10) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 12) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 10) (5, 11) (2, 10) (2, 6) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 0) (12, 1) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-7-4-3-1
- Cycle 2: 1-7-11-0-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has one chord (7, 3).
- Cycle 2 has one chord (7, 0).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, 7, 4, 3> with a chord (7, 3)
- <1, 7, 11, 0> with a chord (7, 0)
