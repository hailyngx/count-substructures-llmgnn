Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 14) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 5) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 12) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 11) (2, 13) (0, 4) (0, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 14) (8, 1) (8, 14) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 9) (9, 7) (9, 11) (9, 14) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 2) (13, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-3-1-4
- Cycle 2: 4-10-5-11-4
- Cycle 3: 4-14-6-7-4
- Cycle 4: 1-3-7-11-1
- Cycle 5: 1-12-10-5-1
- Cycle 6: 4-13-2-14-4
- Cycle 7: 6-0-4-10-6
- Cycle 8: 6-14-8-1-6
- Cycle 9: 9-7-11-13-9

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 11), 4>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [8].
