Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 12) (2, 1) (2, 10) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 10) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 13) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-4-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-7-9-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-9-12-0
- Cycle 4: 1-2-10-13-1
- Cycle 5: 1-2-10-14-1
- Cycle 6: 1-3-4-11-1
- Cycle 7: 1-3-7-9-1
- Cycle 8: 1-13-6-10-1
- Cycle 9: 3-4-11-12-3
- Cycle 10: 4-5-9-6-4
- Cycle 11: 4-14-10-8-4
- Cycle 12: 6-8-0-3-6
- Cycle 13: 6-9-12-7-6
- Cycle 14: 8-0-5-9-8
- Cycle 15: 10-13-6-9-10
- Cycle 16: 10-14-8-0-10

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 4 <1, 2, 13, 10> has exactly one chord (10, 13).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 15 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [15].
