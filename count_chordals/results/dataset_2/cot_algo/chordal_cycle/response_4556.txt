Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-6-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-7-4-0
- Cycle 3: 1-4-2-7-1
- Cycle 4: 1-4-7-5-1
- Cycle 5: 1-4-0-5-1
- Cycle 6: 1-4-0-6-1
- Cycle 7: 2-7-5-0-2
- Cycle 8: 2-7-5-1-2
- Cycle 9: 2-7-4-1-2
- Cycle 10: 5-9-2-7-5
- Cycle 11: 5-9-2-8-5
- Cycle 12: 5-9-1-6-5

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Checking Cycle 1: 0-5-6-8-0 (No chord)
- Checking Cycle 2: 0-5-7-4-0 (Chord: 5-4)
- Checking Cycle 3: 1-4-2-7-1 (No chord)
- Checking Cycle 4: 1-4-7-5-1 (No chord)
- Checking Cycle 5: 1-4-0-5-1 (No chord)
- Checking Cycle 6: 1-4-0-6-1 (Chord: 4-0)
- Checking Cycle 7: 2-7-5-0-2 (Chord: 7-5)
- Checking Cycle 8: 2-7-5-1-2 (Chord: 7-1)
- Checking Cycle 9: 2-7-4-1-2 (Chord: 7-1)
- Checking Cycle 10: 5-9-2-7-5 (No chord)
- Checking Cycle 11: 5-9-2-8-5 (Chord: 9-8)
- Checking Cycle 12: 5-9-1-6-5 (Chord: 9-1)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
- Total chordal 4-cycles = 4, hence the answer is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, (5, 4), 7>
- <1, (4, 0), 6>
- <2, (7, 5), 1>
- <5, (9, 1), 8>
