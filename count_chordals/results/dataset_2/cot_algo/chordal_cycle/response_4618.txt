Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 22) (21, 20) (21, 29) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 22) (23, 26) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 11) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 15) (13, 2) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 15) (17, 20) (17, 16) (17, 24) (20, 21) (20, 17) (20, 18) (3, 7) (3, 22) (0, 7) (0, 11) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 12) (26, 23) (26, 25) (26, 6) (11, 1) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 25) (6, 26) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 15) (6, 27) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 19) (14, 24) (18, 20) (18, 10) (16, 17) (16, 4) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 22) (25, 26) (25, 11) (25, 28) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 19) (19, 14) (19, 4) (29, 21) (29, 24) (10, 6) (10, 18) (10, 27) (10, 24) (24, 17) (24, 14) (24, 29) (24, 10) (24, 28) (27, 6) (27, 10) (27, 28) (15, 5) (15, 13) (15, 6) (22, 1) (22, 8) (22, 3) (22, 12) (28, 25) (28, 24) (28, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<0, 7, 9, 8>
<0, 7, 14, 24>
<0, 7, 14, 19>
<1, 11, 2, 13>
<4, 5, 13, 12>
<4, 5, 15, 6>
<4, 16, 17, 20>
<6, 14, 19, 4>
<6, 14, 24, 17>
<6, 27, 10, 18>
<7, 9, 8, 22>
<10, 18, 20, 17>
<10, 18, 20, 21>
<10, 24, 14, 7>
<10, 24, 29, 21>
<11, 25, 26, 6>
<12, 13, 2, 8>
<15, 13, 5, 4>
<15, 13, 12, 9>
<15, 6, 14, 7>
<16, 17, 20, 18>
<19, 14, 7, 0>
<25, 26, 23, 6>
<25, 26, 6, 14>
<25, 11, 0, 7>
<27, 6, 26, 25>
<27, 10, 18, 20>
<27, 28, 25, 11>
<28, 25, 26, 6>
<28, 25, 11, 1>
<28, 27, 6, 14>


Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Only the following cycles have exactly one chord:
<1, 11, 2, 13> has chord (0, 7)
<4, 5, 13, 12> has chord (9, 8)
<4, 5, 15, 6> has chord (14, 7)
<6, 14, 19, 4> has chord (17, 20)
<6, 27, 10, 18> has chord (20, 21)
<10, 24, 14, 7> has chord (0, 11)
<10, 24, 29, 21> has chord (16, 17)
<25, 26, 23, 6> has chord (14, 19)
<27, 10, 18, 20> has chord (24, 17)


Step 3: Count the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles in total, so the answer is [9].
