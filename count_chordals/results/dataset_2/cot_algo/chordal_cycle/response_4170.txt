Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 12) (13, 27) (13, 18) (13, 6) (22, 13) (22, 18) (22, 21) (2, 29) (2, 5) (2, 28) (2, 15) (29, 2) (29, 16) (4, 9) (4, 28) (4, 25) (7, 11) (7, 9) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 1) (10, 16) (11, 7) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 20) (23, 0) (8, 1) (18, 13) (18, 22) (18, 3) (15, 2) (15, 26) (15, 14) (20, 11) (20, 19) (20, 16) (0, 23) (0, 14) (0, 26) (14, 15) (14, 0) (14, 5) (19, 20) (19, 26) (19, 27) (26, 15) (26, 0) (26, 19) (26, 5) (5, 2) (5, 14) (5, 26) (5, 24) (6, 13) (28, 2) (28, 4) (1, 10) (1, 8) (1, 25) (1, 12) (3, 18) (3, 21) (21, 22) (21, 10) (21, 3) (21, 27) (17, 16) (17, 27) (25, 4) (25, 1) (25, 12) (16, 29) (16, 10) (16, 20) (16, 17) (24, 5) (24, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 24) (27, 13) (27, 19) (27, 21) (27, 17) (12, 13) (12, 11) (12, 1) (12, 25) 

Response:
The given graph has multiple cycles of length 4 or more. Let's identify and analyze the chordal 4-cycles in this graph using the steps provided:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 13-22-18-3-13
- Cycle 2: 13-22-21-3-18-13
- Cycle 3: 13-22-21-10-1-25-12-13
- Cycle 4: 13-22-21-10-11-7-9-4-28-13
- Cycle 5: 13-22-21-10-16-29-2-15-14-0-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
Analyzing the cycles found, none of them contain exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
As no chordal 4-cycle (4-cycle with exactly one chord) was found in the graph, the count of chordless cycles is 5.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
