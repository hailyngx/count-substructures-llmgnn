Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 17) (9, 14) (9, 0) (9, 12) (14, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (17, 9) (17, 1) (1, 5) (1, 17) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 14) (3, 1) (4, 13) (4, 11) (4, 15) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 8) (7, 13) (2, 1) (2, 18) (2, 19) (18, 2) (18, 12) (18, 8) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 15) (16, 7) (16, 6) (6, 1) (6, 16) (6, 11) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 10) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 8) (19, 2) (8, 14) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 6) (8, 11) (15, 4) (15, 7) (15, 13) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 18) (12, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-12-18-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-17-9-14-3-1
- Cycle 3: 1-17-9-12-18-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-17-9-12-10-0-9-14-3-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-16-7-13-4-11-6
- Cycle 6: 1-6-16-7-15-4-13-7-8-6
- Cycle 7: 1-3-14-9-17-1
- Cycle 8: 1-3-14-8-7-16-6-11-4-13-1

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord:
- <1, (9, 12), 2>
- <1, (17, 9), 3> 
- <1, (12, 18), 2>
- <1, (9, 12), 3>
- <1, (4, 15), 13>
- <1, (16, 7), 6>
- <1, (3, 14), 8>
- <1, (13, 7), 4>

Step 3:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [8].
