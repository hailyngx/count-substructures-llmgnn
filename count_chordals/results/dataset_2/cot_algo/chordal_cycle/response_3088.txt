Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 17) (5, 21) (5, 14) (9, 7) (27, 4) (27, 13) (27, 16) (27, 6) (20, 0) (20, 21) (20, 19) (25, 1) (25, 28) (0, 20) (0, 3) (0, 28) (0, 4) (28, 25) (28, 0) (28, 29) (28, 24) (29, 28) (29, 13) (17, 5) (17, 21) (2, 18) (2, 26) (2, 19) (2, 7) (18, 5) (18, 2) (18, 26) (18, 6) (22, 11) (22, 16) (26, 2) (26, 18) (26, 13) (26, 8) (13, 27) (13, 29) (13, 26) (13, 7) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 19) (4, 24) (8, 26) (8, 12) (10, 21) (10, 3) (10, 1) (21, 5) (21, 20) (21, 17) (21, 10) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 23) (3, 12) (6, 27) (6, 18) (6, 7) (14, 5) (14, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 13) (7, 6) (19, 20) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 16) (1, 25) (1, 10) (1, 14) (1, 16) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 23) (11, 22) (16, 27) (16, 22) (16, 19) (16, 1) (24, 28) (24, 4) (23, 3) (23, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 17, 21, 5)
- Cycle 2: (2, 18, 26, 2)
- Cycle 3: (0, 20, 21, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 20, 19, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 28, 25, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 28, 29, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 28, 24, 0)
- Cycle 8: (1, 25, 28, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 25, 14, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 14, 5, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 14, 27, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 14, 1, 16, 1)
- Cycle 13: (1, 16, 27, 1)
- Cycle 14: (1, 16, 19, 1)
- Cycle 15: (1, 16, 22, 1)
- Cycle 16: (1, 16, 1)
- Cycle 17: (1, 16, 22, 11, 1)
- Cycle 18: (1, 16, 22, 16, 1)
- Cycle 19: (1, 16, 1, 14, 1)
- Cycle 20: (1, 3, 0, 1)
- Cycle 21: (1, 3, 10, 1)
- Cycle 22: (1, 3, 12, 1)
- Cycle 23: (1, 10, 3, 1)
- Cycle 24: (1, 10, 21, 1)
- Cycle 25: (1, 10, 1)
- Cycle 26: (1, 10, 21, 5, 1)
- Cycle 27: (1, 14, 5, 17, 1)
- Cycle 28: (1, 16, 19, 20, 1)
- Cycle 29: (1, 14, 5, 17, 21, 1)
- Cycle 30: (1, 14, 27, 13, 1)
- Cycle 31: (1, 14, 1, 22, 11, 1)
- Cycle 32: (1, 16, 19, 20, 21, 1)
- Cycle 33: (1, 14, 27, 6, 7, 1)
- Cycle 34: (1, 16, 19, 4, 0, 1)
- Cycle 35: (1, 3, 0, 20, 21, 1)
- Cycle 36: (1, 3, 12, 8, 26, 1)
- Cycle 37: (1, 10, 21, 20, 0, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, (17, 21), 5>
<2, (18, 26), 2>
<20, (19, 21), 0>
<25, (28), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [33].
