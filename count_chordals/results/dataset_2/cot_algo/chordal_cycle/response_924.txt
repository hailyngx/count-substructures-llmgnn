Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 15) (17, 4) (17, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 0) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 16) (11, 0) (11, 12) (2, 7) (18, 15) (18, 0) (18, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 18) (3, 16) (3, 19) (3, 5) (5, 3) (5, 19) (5, 13) (5, 4) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 7) (13, 10) (13, 5) (4, 14) (4, 17) (4, 5) (12, 14) (12, 10) (12, 11) (15, 17) (15, 18) (7, 17) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 19) (7, 8) (16, 10) (16, 3) (16, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 18) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 16) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: (0, 6, 9, 0)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 6, 7, 8, 1, 0)
        - Cycle 3: (0, 6, 7, 17, 15, 18, 3, 16, 10, 12, 11, 0)
        - Cycle 4: (1, 6, 7, 2, 5, 13, 10, 12, 11, 0, 18, 15, 17, 7, 8, 1)
        - Cycle 5: (3, 18, 15, 17, 7, 2, 5, 13, 10, 16, 3)
        - Cycle 6: (4, 14, 17, 7, 2, 5, 13, 10, 12, 11, 0, 18, 15, 17, 4)
        - Cycle 7: (16, 10, 13, 5, 3, 18, 15, 17, 7, 8, 16)
        - Cycle 8: (18, 15, 17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 10, 12, 11, 0, 6, 7, 2, 18) 
        - Cycle 9: (19, 3, 18, 15, 17, 7, 2, 5, 13, 10, 12, 11, 0, 9, 6, 0)
        - Cycle 10: (0, 11, 12, 10, 13, 5, 3, 16, 8, 7, 6, 1, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        - Cycle 1: (0, 6, 9, 0) <0, 9>
        - Cycle 2: (0, 6, 7, 8, 1, 0) <1, 6>
        - Cycle 3: (0, 6, 7, 17, 15, 18, 3, 16, 10, 12, 11, 0) <0, 6>
        - Cycle 4: (1, 6, 7, 2, 5, 13, 10, 12, 11, 0, 18, 15, 17, 7, 8, 1) <1, 6>
        - Cycle 5: (3, 18, 15, 17, 7, 2, 5, 13, 10, 16, 3) <3, 15>
        - Cycle 6: (4, 14, 17, 7, 2, 5, 13, 10, 12, 11, 0, 18, 15, 17, 4) <4, 17>
        - Cycle 7: (16, 10, 13, 5, 3, 18, 15, 17, 7, 8, 16) <5, 8>
        - Cycle 8: (18, 15, 17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 10, 12, 11, 0, 6, 7, 2, 18) <5, 6>
        - Cycle 9: (19, 3, 18, 15, 17, 7, 2, 5, 13, 10, 12, 11, 0, 9, 6, 0) <6, 9>
        - Cycle 10: (0, 11, 12, 10, 13, 5, 3, 16, 8, 7, 6, 1, 0) <6, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

        There are [6] unique chordal 4-cycles found.

        The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
        <0, 6, 9, 0>
        <0, 6, 7, 8, 1, 0>
        <0, 6, 7, 17, 15, 18, 3, 16, 10, 12, 11, 0>
        <3, 18, 15, 17, 7, 2, 5, 13, 10, 16, 3>
        <4, 14, 17, 7, 2, 5, 13, 10, 12, 11, 0, 18, 15, 17, 4>
        <19, 3, 18, 15, 17, 7, 2, 5, 13, 10, 12, 11, 0, 9, 6, 0>
