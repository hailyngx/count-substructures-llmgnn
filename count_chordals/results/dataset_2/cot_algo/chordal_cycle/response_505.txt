Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 17) (3, 5) (3, 18) (15, 10) (15, 18) (8, 17) (8, 7) (13, 4) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 8) (7, 13) (12, 18) (12, 11) (12, 1) (9, 18) (9, 2) (9, 19) (10, 15) (10, 6) (10, 4) (4, 13) (4, 10) (0, 16) (0, 19) (0, 2) (16, 0) (16, 1) (16, 6) (16, 14) (18, 3) (18, 15) (18, 12) (18, 9) (18, 17) (6, 10) (6, 16) (6, 17) (6, 11) (17, 3) (17, 8) (17, 18) (17, 6) (1, 12) (1, 16) (1, 14) (11, 12) (11, 6) (2, 13) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 3) (5, 2) (14, 16) (14, 1) (14, 19) (19, 9) (19, 0) (19, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
1. (3, 5, 2, 13)
2. (3, 5, 2, 0)
3. (3, 5, 2, 9)
4. (3, 5, 2, 13, 4)
5. (3, 5, 2, 9, 19)
6. (3, 5, 2, 0, 19)
7. (3, 5, 2, 0, 16)
8. (12, 1, 16, 0)
9. (12, 1, 16, 0, 19)
10. (12, 1, 16, 6, 10)
11. (12, 1, 16, 6, 11)
12. (12, 1, 14, 19)
13. (12, 1, 14, 16, 0)
14. (12, 1, 14, 16, 6)
15. (9, 19, 14, 1)
16. (9, 19, 14, 16, 0)
17. (9, 19, 14, 16, 6)
18. (9, 19, 0, 16, 1)
19. (9, 19, 0, 16, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- No cycle has exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 19 unique chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [19].
The unique chordless cycles are:
<3, 5, 2, 13>
<3, 5, 2, 0>
<3, 5, 2, 9>
<3, 5, 2, 13, 4>
<3, 5, 2, 9, 19>
<3, 5, 2, 0, 19>
<3, 5, 2, 0, 16>
<12, 1, 16, 0>
<12, 1, 16, 0, 19>
<12, 1, 16, 6, 10>
<12, 1, 16, 6, 11>
<12, 1, 14, 19>
<12, 1, 14, 16, 0>
<12, 1, 14, 16, 6>
<9, 19, 14, 1>
<9, 19, 14, 16, 0>
<9, 19, 14, 16, 6>
<9, 19, 0, 16, 1>
<9, 19, 0, 16, 14>
