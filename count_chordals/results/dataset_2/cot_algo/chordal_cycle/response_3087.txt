Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-14-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-8-4-1-0-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-8-2-12-5
- Cycle 4: 5-12-7-10-1-4-8-5
- Cycle 5: 6-9-8-4-1-10-7-6
- Cycle 6: 6-9-8-2-12-7-10-6
- Cycle 7: 2-8-4-1-10-7-12-2
- Cycle 8: 2-8-4-1-0-14-3-12-2

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord 6-14
- Cycle 2 has one chord 8-4
- Cycle 3 has one chord 8-2
- Cycle 4 has one chord 7-10
- Cycle 5 has one chord 8-4
- Cycle 6 has one chord 8-2
- Cycle 7 has one chord 4-1
- Cycle 8 has one chord 0-14

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 6, 14, 9>
<5, 8, 4, 9>
<5, 8, 2, 9>
<5, 12, 7, 10>
<6, 10, 7, 9>
<6, 8, 2, 9>
<2, 12, 4, 8>
<0, 1, 14, 2>
