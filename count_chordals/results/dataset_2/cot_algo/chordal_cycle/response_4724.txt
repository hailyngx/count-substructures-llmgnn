Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 14) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 12) (11, 6) (11, 1) (11, 12) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 12) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 10) (10, 3) (10, 0) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 13) (14, 2) (14, 12) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 9) (12, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-7-9-1
- Cycle 2: 1-7-8-1
- Cycle 3: 1-7-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-7-1
- Cycle 5: 1-9-8-1
- Cycle 6: 1-9-12-1
- Cycle 7: 1-7-13-1
- Cycle 8: 1-11-6-1
- Cycle 9: 1-11-12-1
- Cycle 10: 1-13-5-1
- Cycle 11: 2-7-8-2
- Cycle 12: 2-7-14-2
- Cycle 13: 2-14-12-2
- Cycle 14: 3-4-7-3
- Cycle 15: 3-4-6-3
- Cycle 16: 3-5-6-3
- Cycle 17: 3-5-13-3
- Cycle 18: 3-5-0-3
- Cycle 19: 3-0-8-3
- Cycle 20: 3-0-10-3
- Cycle 21: 3-12-8-3
- Cycle 22: 3-12-11-3
- Cycle 23: 4-7-9-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<1, 7, 9, 1> - Chord: (7, 9)
<1, 7, 8, 1> - Chord: (7, 8)
<1, 9, 12, 1> - Chord: (9, 12)
<1, 7, 13, 1> - Chord: (7, 13)
<1, 11, 6, 1> - Chord: (11, 6)
<2, 7, 8, 2> - Chord: (7, 8)
<2, 7, 14, 2> - Chord: (7, 14)
<2, 14, 12, 2> - Chord: (14, 12)
<3, 5, 13, 3> - Chord: (5, 13)
<3, 0, 10, 3> - Chord: (0, 10)
<4, 7, 9, 4> - Chord: (7, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [10].
