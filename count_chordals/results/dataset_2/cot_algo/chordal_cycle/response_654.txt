Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 4) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 14) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 13) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 13) (12, 6) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 1, 6, 10>  
<0, 1, 14, 9>  
<0, 1, 14, 13>  
<0, 4, 9, 8>  
<0, 4, 13, 8>  
<0, 5, 12, 6>  
<0, 7, 8, 3>  
<1, 6, 10, 4>  
<1, 14, 9, 8>  
<1, 14, 13, 8>  
<2, 4, 10, 6>  
<3, 8, 13, 12>  
<3, 10, 6, 1>  
<3, 10, 14, 9>  
<3, 10, 14, 13>  
<4, 9, 8, 7>  
<4, 9, 11, 10>  
<4, 10, 6, 12>  
<4, 13, 8, 7>  
<4, 13, 12, 5>  
<5, 11, 9, 14>  
<5, 12, 7, 0>  
<6, 1, 0, 7>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0, 1, 6, 10> (Chord: 1-6)  
<0, 1, 14, 9> (Chord: 1-9)  
<0, 1, 14, 13> (Chord: 1-13)  
<0, 4, 9, 8> (Chord: 4-8)  
<0, 4, 13, 8> (Chord: 4-8)  
<0, 5, 12, 6> (Chord: 5-6)  
<0, 7, 8, 3> (Chord: 8-3)  
<1, 6, 10, 4> (Chord: 6-4)  
<1, 14, 9, 8> (Chord: 9-8)  
<1, 14, 13, 8> (Chord: 13-8)  
<2, 4, 10, 6> (Chord: 4-6)  
<3, 8, 13, 12> (Chord: 8-13)  
<3, 10, 6, 1> (Chord: 6-1)  
<3, 10, 14, 9> (Chord: 10-9)  
<3, 10, 14, 13> (Chord: 10-13)  
<4, 9, 8, 7> (Chord: 9-7)  
<4, 9, 11, 10> (Chord: 9-10)  
<4, 10, 6, 12> (Chord: 6-12)  
<4, 13, 8, 7> (Chord: 8-7)  
<4, 13, 12, 5> (Chord: 12-5)  
<5, 11, 9, 14> (Chord: 11-14)  
<5, 12, 7, 0> (Chord: 7-0)  
<6, 1, 0, 7> (Chord: 1-7)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [22]
