Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 4) (2, 12) (2, 6) (2, 15) (18, 9) (18, 0) (18, 17) (3, 6) (3, 19) (3, 5) (0, 18) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (7, 9) (7, 13) (1, 11) (1, 15) (1, 19) (1, 9) (1, 8) (15, 2) (15, 1) (15, 5) (13, 0) (13, 7) (13, 17) (13, 10) (13, 19) (17, 18) (17, 13) (17, 12) (12, 2) (12, 17) (12, 6) (9, 18) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 14) (14, 7) (14, 6) (8, 1) (5, 3) (5, 15) (5, 4) (10, 13) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 5) (19, 3) (19, 1) (19, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 0-18-17-13-0
- Cycle 2: 0-18-9-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-18-9-1-15-2-6-3-5-0
- Cycle 4: 0-18-9-1-15-5-3-6-2-12-17-13-0
- Cycle 5: 0-18-9-1-15-5-4-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: Chord 0-13.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 4 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 18, 9, 7>
- <0, 18, 17, 13>
- <0, 18, 9, 1, 15, 2, 6, 3, 5>
- <0, 18, 9, 1, 15, 5, 4>
