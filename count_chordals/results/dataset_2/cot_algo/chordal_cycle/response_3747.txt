Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 2) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 11) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 12) (12, 4) (12, 9) (12, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 11) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 14) (14, 1) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 10) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle 1: 0 - 7 - 2 - 10 - 0
2. Cycle 2: 0 - 7 - 11 - 6 - 0
3. Cycle 3: 1 - 8 - 2 - 9 - 1
4. Cycle 4: 1 - 8 - 3 - 13 - 1
5. Cycle 5: 2 - 7 - 11 - 14 - 2
6. Cycle 6: 3 - 4 - 12 - 9 - 3
7. Cycle 7: 6 - 4 - 12 - 14 - 6
8. Cycle 8: 6 - 13 - 3 - 8 - 6
9. Cycle 9: 7 - 0 - 6 - 13 - 7
10. Cycle 10: 9 - 8 - 1 - 14 - 9
11. Cycle 11: 10 - 2 - 7 - 4 - 10
12. Cycle 12: 10 - 13 - 6 - 11 - 10
13. Cycle 13: 11 - 7 - 0 - 2 - 11
14. Cycle 14: 11 - 8 - 1 - 9 - 11
15. Cycle 15: 12 - 4 - 6 - 11 - 12
16. Cycle 16: 14 - 1 - 9 - 12 - 14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

1. Cycle 9: 7 - 0 - 6 - 13 - 7 has exactly one chord 0-6.
2. Cycle 13: 11 - 7 - 0 - 2 - 11 has exactly one chord 0-2.
3. Cycle 14: 11 - 8 - 1 - 9 - 11 has exactly one chord 1-9.
4. Cycle 16: 14 - 1 - 9 - 12 - 14 has exactly one chord 1-9.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Number of chordless cycles = 16 - 4 = 12

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [12].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <0, 6, 13, 7>
2. <0, 2, 7, 11>
3. <1, 9, 8, 11>
4. <1, 9, 12, 14>
