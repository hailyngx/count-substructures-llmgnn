Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 2 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 6 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 0 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 7 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 5: 3 - 8 - 2 - 3
- Cycle 6: 4 - 6 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 7: 5 - 9 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 8: 5 - 9 - 1 - 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1: 0 - 2 - 7 - 0 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 2: 1 - 6 - 3 - 1 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 3: 1 - 0 - 7 - 1 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 4: 1 - 7 - 2 - 1 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 5: 3 - 8 - 2 - 3 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 6: 4 - 6 - 1 - 4 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 7: 5 - 9 - 8 - 5 has a chord <5, 8>.
- Cycle 8: 5 - 9 - 1 - 5 has a chord <5, 1>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 6 chordless cycles found.

Final answer: [6]
