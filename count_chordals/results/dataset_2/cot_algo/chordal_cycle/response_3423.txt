Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 14) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 9) (11, 4) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 12) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 9) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 0) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 10) (14, 5) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 3) (10, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 0, 8, 2, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 3, 13, 5, 12, 2, 4)
- Cycle 3: (2, 4, 11, 1, 7, 0, 2)
- Cycle 4: (0, 4, 11, 1, 7, 0)
- Cycle 5: (8, 2, 12, 5, 13, 3, 8)
- Cycle 6: (13, 5, 12, 9, 8, 3, 13)
- Cycle 7: (3, 13, 11, 1, 7, 0, 3)
- Cycle 8: (11, 4, 3, 10, 6, 0, 11)
- Cycle 9: (7, 0, 6, 10, 3, 13, 7)
- Cycle 10: (12, 2, 9, 8, 0, 7, 1, 11, 5, 13, 3, 10, 6, 12)
- Cycle 11: (5, 13, 3, 9, 12, 5)
- Cycle 12: (2, 8, 0, 1, 7, 4, 11, 13, 5, 10, 3, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, 3, 13, 5>
- <8, 2, 12, 5>
- <3, 13, 11, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [3].
