Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (5, 0, 9, 6, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (7, 4, 0, 8, 7)
        - Cycle 3: (1, 9, 0, 6, 1)
        - Cycle 4: (3, 1, 6, 7, 3)
        - Cycle 5: (3, 2, 8, 9, 1, 3)
        - Cycle 6: (3, 5, 7, 4, 0, 8, 3)
        - Cycle 7: (3, 8, 7, 6, 0, 9, 2, 3)
        - Cycle 8: (0, 4, 7, 5, 3, 6, 9, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1: <1, (9, 6), 5>
        - Cycle 2: <2, (0, 8), 7>
        - Cycle 3: <3, (0, 6), 1>
        - Cycle 4: <4, (1, 7), 6>
        - Cycle 5: <5, (3, 9), 1>
        - Cycle 6: <6, (7, 3), 4>
        - Cycle 7: <7, (8, 6), 3>
        - Cycle 8: <8, (4, 5), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        Therefore, there are [8] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
