Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (17, 14) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 22) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 21) (18, 2) (18, 9) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 8) (0, 20) (0, 23) (20, 0) (20, 1) (20, 21) (1, 20) (1, 19) (1, 8) (26, 10) (24, 27) (24, 10) (4, 27) (27, 18) (27, 24) (27, 4) (27, 29) (27, 7) (16, 2) (16, 9) (16, 6) (28, 18) (8, 18) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 15) (8, 3) (9, 18) (9, 16) (9, 8) (11, 23) (11, 19) (11, 13) (11, 25) (23, 0) (23, 11) (10, 26) (10, 24) (10, 25) (3, 17) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 22) (7, 27) (7, 3) (7, 29) (7, 5) (7, 13) (29, 27) (29, 7) (29, 22) (29, 21) (25, 11) (25, 10) (25, 6) (19, 1) (19, 11) (21, 2) (21, 20) (21, 29) (21, 22) (13, 11) (13, 7) (13, 15) (6, 16) (6, 25) (15, 8) (15, 13) (15, 5) (12, 14) (5, 17) (5, 7) (5, 15) (22, 17) (22, 3) (22, 29) (22, 21) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 20, 1, 8, 18, 27, 4> with 1 chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 2: <1, 20, 0, 23, 11, 19, 1> with 1 chord (0, 11)
- Cycle 3: <2, 18, 27, 4, 26, 10, 24, 27> with 1 chord (2, 24)
- Cycle 4: <3, 17, 22, 21, 29, 27, 4, 26> with 1 chord (17, 21)
- Cycle 5: <5, 17, 22, 29, 21, 20, 0, 23> with 1 chord (17, 23)
- Cycle 6: <6, 16, 9, 8, 1, 20, 21, 22> with 1 chord (9, 21)
- Cycle 7: <7, 27, 4, 26, 10, 25, 11, 23> with 1 chord (27, 11)
- Cycle 8: <10, 26, 4, 27, 18, 9, 16, 6> with 1 chord (26, 16)
- Cycle 9: <13, 11, 23, 0, 20, 21, 29, 27> with 1 chord (11, 21)
- Cycle 10: <15, 8, 18, 27, 4, 26, 10, 25> with 1 chord (8, 26)
- Cycle 11: <16, 2, 21, 20, 1, 19, 11, 23> with 1 chord (2, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 11 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [11].
