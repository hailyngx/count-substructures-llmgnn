Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 22) (21, 1) (21, 10) (21, 22) (21, 17) (2, 4) (2, 15) (2, 20) (2, 25) (29, 6) (10, 21) (10, 15) (11, 8) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 16) (0, 28) (0, 9) (20, 2) (20, 0) (20, 13) (20, 4) (20, 5) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 3) (4, 2) (4, 20) (4, 28) (18, 19) (18, 9) (18, 17) (19, 26) (19, 18) (19, 22) (19, 24) (7, 0) (7, 12) (7, 24) (7, 28) (12, 7) (12, 17) (12, 23) (15, 1) (15, 2) (15, 10) (16, 0) (16, 14) (16, 6) (22, 1) (22, 21) (22, 19) (22, 3) (23, 26) (23, 12) (23, 9) (9, 0) (9, 18) (9, 23) (8, 11) (8, 5) (28, 0) (28, 4) (28, 7) (5, 20) (5, 8) (5, 3) (6, 29) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 13) (14, 16) (14, 6) (14, 25) (24, 19) (24, 7) (25, 2) (25, 14) (17, 21) (17, 18) (17, 12) (13, 20) (13, 6) (13, 3) (3, 26) (3, 22) (3, 5) (3, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with all existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (1, 21, 10, 15, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 4, 20, 0, 2)
- Cycle 3: (26, 19, 22, 3, 26)
- Cycle 4: (0, 20, 4, 28, 0)
- Cycle 5: (18, 19, 22, 3, 18)
- Cycle 6: (7, 0, 20, 4, 7)
- Cycle 7: (12, 7, 0, 16, 12)
- Cycle 8: (15, 1, 21, 10, 15)
- Cycle 9: (16, 0, 20, 2, 16)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chord (10, 15) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 2: Chord (0, 20) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 3: Chord (19, 22) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 4: Chord (20, 4) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 5: Chord (19, 22) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 6: Chord (20, 4) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 7: Chord (0, 16) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 8: Chord (10, 15) => Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 9: Chord (0, 20) => Not a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = 0

Final Answer: [0]

There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
