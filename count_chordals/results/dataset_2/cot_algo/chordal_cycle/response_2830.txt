Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (13, 21, 20, 0, 13)
        - Cycle 2: (13, 21, 18, 14, 26, 9, 17, 3, 23, 13)
        - Cycle 3: (13, 23, 20, 0, 10, 1, 2, 22, 14, 26, 15, 17, 9, 26)
        - Cycle 4: (22, 14, 26, 15, 24, 27, 22)
        - Cycle 5: (3, 23, 20, 21, 18, 14, 26, 15, 8, 3)
        - Cycle 6: (15, 26, 14, 18, 12, 22, 2, 4, 24, 15)
        - Cycle 7: (9, 26, 14, 18, 12, 22, 2, 1, 16, 9)
        - Cycle 8: (26, 15, 24, 27, 22, 12, 18, 14, 26)
        - Cycle 9: (4, 24, 15, 26, 14, 22, 2, 1, 20, 23, 13, 7, 4)
        - Cycle 10: (0, 20, 21, 18, 14, 26, 15, 8, 6, 25, 29, 19, 0)
        - Cycle 11: (20, 1, 16, 9, 26, 14, 22, 2, 11, 20)
        - Cycle 12: (10, 0, 20, 21, 18, 14, 26, 15, 17, 9, 16, 1, 10)
        - Cycle 13: (21, 13, 23, 20, 0, 19, 29, 27, 22, 14, 26, 15, 24, 21)

Step 2: Check cycles for exactly one chord:
        - <1, (26, 9), 9>
        - <2, (22, 12), 22>
        - <3, (14, 26), 15>
        - <4, (22, 14), 26>
        - <5, (3, 17), 15>
        - <6, (14, 18), 26>
        - <7, (12, 18), 22>
        - <8, (26, 9), 15>
        - <9, (24, 4), 15>
        - <10, (20, 21), 18>
        - <11, (22, 2), 26>
        - <12, (0, 20), 21>
        - <13, (14, 26), 9>
        - <14, (22, 27), 25>
        - <15, (2, 22), 27>
        - <16, (12, 18), 22>
        - <17, (9, 26), 14>
        - <18, (29, 19), 27>
        - <19, (8, 6), 25>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles: [19]
