Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 4) (9, 11) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 11) (13, 5) (13, 3) (13, 1) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 1) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (14, 5) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (5, 7) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 14) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 13) (1, 12) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 2) (3, 4) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 14) (10, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (6, 1, 7, 4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (9, 10, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 3: (4, 3, 13, 1, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 1, 13, 3, 7)
- Cycle 5: (12, 1, 13, 5, 12)
- Cycle 6: (0, 5, 14, 9, 0)
- Cycle 7: (14, 12, 9, 11, 14)
- Cycle 8: (2, 11, 9, 14, 2)

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (4, 7), 6>
- Cycle 2: <9, (6, 1), 10>
- Cycle 3: <4, (1, 13), 3>
- Cycle 4: <7, (3, 13), 1>
- Cycle 5: <12, (1, 13), 5>
- Cycle 6: <0, (5, 14), 9>
- Cycle 7: <14, (9, 11), 12>
- Cycle 8: <2, (9, 14), 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. Thus, the answer is [8].
