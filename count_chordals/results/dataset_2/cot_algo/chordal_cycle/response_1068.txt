Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 1-5-8-2-1
        - Cycle 2: 1-6-0-4-1
        - Cycle 3: 1-8-3-0-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 (1-5-8-2-1): Chord (5, 8)
        - Cycle 2 (1-6-0-4-1): Chord (6, 4)
        - Cycle 3 (1-8-3-0-1): Chord (8, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <1, (5, 8), (2, 8)> 
        <2, (6, 4), (0, 4)>
        <3, (8, 3), (0, 3)>
