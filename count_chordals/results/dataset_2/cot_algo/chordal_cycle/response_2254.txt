Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 0) (16, 7) (6, 11) (6, 10) (6, 19) (9, 15) (9, 0) (14, 3) (14, 13) (14, 5) (17, 5) (17, 8) (1, 11) (1, 3) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 1) (3, 19) (3, 4) (2, 8) (18, 1) (18, 0) (18, 12) (8, 17) (8, 2) (8, 10) (5, 14) (5, 17) (5, 13) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 15) (13, 19) (19, 6) (19, 3) (19, 13) (0, 16) (0, 9) (0, 18) (0, 4) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 18) (12, 4) (12, 10) (7, 16) (7, 15) (7, 10) (15, 11) (15, 9) (15, 13) (15, 7) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 12) (10, 7) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (11, 1, 3, 14, 5, 17, 8, 2)
- Cycle 2: (11, 1, 3, 19, 6, 10, 8, 17)
- Cycle 3: (11, 1, 18, 12, 4, 0, 16, 7)
- Cycle 4: (11, 1, 18, 0, 9, 15, 7, 16)
- Cycle 5: (11, 1, 18, 0, 4, 3, 14, 13)
- Cycle 6: (11, 1, 3, 4, 0, 16, 7, 10)
- Cycle 7: (11, 1, 18, 0, 16, 7, 10, 6)
- Cycle 8: (11, 1, 18, 0, 16, 7, 15, 9)
- Cycle 9: (11, 1, 18, 12, 10, 6, 19, 13)
- Cycle 10: (11, 1, 18, 12, 4, 3, 19, 13)
- Cycle 11: (11, 6, 19, 3, 14, 13, 19, 15)
- Cycle 12: (11, 6, 10, 8, 17, 5, 14, 13)
- Cycle 13: (11, 6, 10, 12, 4, 3, 1, 18)
- Cycle 14: (11, 6, 19, 13, 15, 7, 16, 0)
- Cycle 15: (11, 6, 10, 8, 2, 17, 5, 14)
- Cycle 16: (11, 6, 10, 12, 18, 1, 3, 14)
- Cycle 17: (11, 15, 9, 0, 18, 1, 3, 4)
- Cycle 18: (11, 15, 7, 16, 0, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 19: (11, 15, 9, 0, 16, 7, 10, 6)
- Cycle 20: (11, 15, 7, 16, 0, 18, 1, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, (3, 14), 5>
- <11, (6, 10), 8>
- <11, (1, 18), 12>
- <11, (1, 18), 0>
- <11, (1, 18), 0>
- <11, (1, 18), 0>
- <11, (1, 18), 0>
- <11, (1, 18), 0>
- <11, (1, 18), 12>
- <11, (1, 18), 12>
- <11, (6, 10), 8>
- <11, (6, 10), 12>
- <11, (1, 18), 12>
- <11, (6, 10), 12>
- <11, (6, 10), 8>
- <11, (6, 10), 12>
- <11, (1, 18), 12>
- <11, (1, 18), 12>
- <11, (1, 18), 0>
- <11, (1, 18), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [6] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:
- <1, (3, 14), 5>
- <11, (6, 10), 8>
- <11, (1, 18), 12>
- <11, (1, 18), 0>
- <11, (6, 10), 12>
- <11, (1, 18), 0>
