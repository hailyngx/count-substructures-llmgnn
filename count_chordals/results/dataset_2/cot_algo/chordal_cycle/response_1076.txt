Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 7, 9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 7, 9, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 9, 7, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 2, 7, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 8, 5, 0, 1)
- Cycle 6: (3, 1, 6, 7, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 1, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 2, 7, 9, 3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 2, 8, 1, 3)
- Cycle 10: (6, 1, 3, 7, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 1, 9, 7, 6)
- Cycle 12: (6, 0, 7, 9, 6)
- Cycle 13: (8, 1, 3, 7, 8)
- Cycle 14: (8, 1, 6, 7, 8)
- Cycle 15: (8, 1, 9, 7, 8)
- Cycle 16: (8, 2, 7, 9, 8)
- Cycle 17: (8, 5, 0, 7, 8)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 7, 9, 1> has a chord (1, 9)
- <1, 6, 7, 9, 1> has a chord (6, 9)
- <1, 8, 2, 7, 1> has a chord (1, 2)
- <1, 8, 5, 0, 1> has a chord (1, 5)
- <3, 1, 6, 7, 3> has a chord (3, 6)
- <3, 2, 7, 9, 3> has a chord (3, 9)
- <6, 1, 9, 7, 6> has a chord (1, 7)
- <8, 2, 7, 9, 8> has a chord (2, 9)
- <8, 5, 0, 7, 8> has a chord (5, 7)

Step 3: Counting number of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [9].
