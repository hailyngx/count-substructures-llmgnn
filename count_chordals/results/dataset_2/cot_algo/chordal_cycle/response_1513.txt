Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 14) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 14) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 13) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 10) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 10) (12, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 13) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (10, 8) (10, 12) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 12) (11, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle <5, 9, 4, 7>
- Cycle <5, 1, 6, 10>
- Cycle <5, 14, 13, 11>
- Cycle <9, 2, 8, 1>
- Cycle <9, 11, 13, 14>
- Cycle <4, 7, 12, 8>
- Cycle <7, 12, 10, 6>
- Cycle <1, 6, 0, 3>
- Cycle <8, 11, 12, 10>
- Cycle <12, 11, 13, 14>
- Cycle <0, 6, 10, 12>
- Cycle <14, 13, 11, 9>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- The cycle <5, 9, 4, 7> has exactly one chord: (9, 4)
- The cycle <5, 1, 6, 10> has exactly one chord: (1, 6)
- The cycle <5, 14, 13, 11> has exactly one chord: (14, 11)
- The cycle <9, 2, 8, 1> has no chords
- The cycle <9, 11, 13, 14> has no chords
- The cycle <4, 7, 12, 8> has exactly one chord: (7, 8)
- The cycle <7, 12, 10, 6> has no chords
- The cycle <1, 6, 0, 3> has exactly one chord: (6, 3)
- The cycle <8, 11, 12, 10> has exactly one chord: (11, 12)
- The cycle <12, 11, 13, 14> has exactly one chord: (11, 14)
- The cycle <0, 6, 10, 12> has no chords
- The cycle <14, 13, 11, 9> has exactly one chord: (13, 11)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 9, 4, 7>
<5, 1, 6, 10>
<5, 14, 13, 11>
<4, 7, 12, 8>
<14, 13, 11, 9>
