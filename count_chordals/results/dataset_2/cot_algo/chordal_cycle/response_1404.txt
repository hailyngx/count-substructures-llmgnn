Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 8) (14, 5) (17, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 11) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 15) (8, 14) (8, 4) (8, 16) (8, 15) (8, 0) (5, 14) (5, 12) (5, 15) (6, 10) (6, 11) (18, 3) (18, 13) (1, 17) (1, 4) (1, 16) (1, 10) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 16) (7, 0) (7, 3) (13, 18) (13, 19) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 2) (16, 19) (2, 16) (2, 11) (12, 5) (12, 3) (3, 17) (3, 18) (3, 7) (3, 12) (11, 17) (11, 6) (11, 2) (11, 9) (19, 13) (19, 16) (9, 11) (9, 15) (15, 4) (15, 8) (15, 5) (15, 9) (10, 6) (10, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

There are several cycles in the graph, but we are interested in cycles of length 4: 
- Cycle 1: (14, 8, 4, 1, 14)
- Cycle 2: (14, 5, 15, 8, 14)
- Cycle 3: (17, 1, 4, 8, 17)
- Cycle 4: (17, 3, 7, 0, 16, 1, 17)
- Cycle 5: (3, 18, 13, 19, 16, 0, 7, 3)
- Cycle 6: (11, 2, 16, 1, 17, 11)
- Cycle 7: (11, 6, 10, 1, 17, 11)
- Cycle 8: (11, 9, 15, 5, 14, 17, 11)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the cycles listed above, there are two chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (4, 8), 16, 17>
2. <5, (14, 15), 8, 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
