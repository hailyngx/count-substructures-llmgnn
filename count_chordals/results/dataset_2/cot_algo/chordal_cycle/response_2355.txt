Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (15, 1) (15, 10) (15, 12) (14, 1) (17, 10) (17, 16) (17, 9) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 16) (13, 11) (13, 1) (13, 19) (10, 15) (10, 17) (10, 5) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 11) (0, 18) (0, 2) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 12) (4, 5) (4, 18) (18, 0) (18, 4) (18, 19) (18, 7) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 16) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 19) (19, 13) (19, 18) (19, 9) (19, 16) (12, 15) (12, 2) (11, 13) (11, 5) (11, 6) (7, 3) (7, 18) (16, 17) (16, 8) (16, 1) (16, 19) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (3, 5, 10, 15)
- Cycle 2: (3, 5, 6, 11)
- Cycle 3: (5, 10, 15, 1)
- Cycle 4: (5, 10, 17, 16)
- Cycle 5: (5, 11, 13, 1)
- Cycle 6: (6, 11, 13, 1)
- Cycle 7: (0, 18, 19, 9)
- Cycle 8: (2, 8, 16, 1)
- Cycle 9: (2, 8, 9, 19)
- Cycle 10: (11, 13, 19, 9)
- Cycle 11: (16, 17, 10, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, (5, 10), 15>
- <5, (10, 17), 16>
- <5, (11, 13), 1>
- <6, (11, 13), 1>
- <0, (18, 19), 9>
- <2, (8, 9), 19>
- <11, (13, 19), 9>
- <16, (17, 10), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <3, (5, 10), 15>
- <5, (11, 13), 1>
