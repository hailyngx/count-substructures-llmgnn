Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

<11, (16, 1), 6, 14>
<11, (5, 9), 16, 10>
<11, 5, 9, (10, 8), 16>
<16, 1, 7, (0, 6), 14>
<8, 16, 10, 14, (6, 0)>
<9, 11, (16, 10), 14, 6>
<6, (1, 16), 8, 9, 10>
<8, (0, 7), 1, 6, 14>
<4, 13, (15, 17), 4>
<4, 13, (3, 2), 9, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are [10] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
