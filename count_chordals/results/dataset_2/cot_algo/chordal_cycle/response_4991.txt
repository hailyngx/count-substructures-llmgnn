Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Candidates for cycles of length 4 or more:
1. Cycle 1-4-7-8-1 (length 4)
2. Cycle 1-5-3-4-1 (length 4)
3. Cycle 1-5-6-3-1 (length 4)
4. Cycle 1-5-6-2-1 (length 4)
5. Cycle 2-4-3-6-2 (length 4)
6. Cycle 2-9-0-5-2 (length 4)
7. Cycle 3-4-2-6-3 (length 4)
8. Cycle 3-5-8-6-3 (length 4)
9. Cycle 3-5-8-0-3 (length 4)
10. Cycle 4-1-5-2-4 (length 4)
11. Cycle 4-3-6-5-4 (length 4)
12. Cycle 5-0-8-3-5 (length 4)
13. Cycle 7-4-3-6-7 (length 4)
14. Cycle 8-7-4-3-8 (length 4)
15. Cycle 8-5-0-9-8 (length 4)

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (1, 4), 5>: Chords (1, 4) in cycle 1-4-7-8-1
- <2, (2, 5), 4>: Chords (2, 5) in cycle 2-4-3-6-2
- <3, (2, 6), 8>: Chords (2, 6) in cycle 2-9-0-5-2
- <4, (3, 8), 5>: Chords (3, 8) in cycle 1-5-6-3-1
- <5, (3, 5), 6>: Chords (3, 5) in cycle 1-5-3-4-1
- <6, (5, 8), 0>: Chords (5, 8) in cycle 3-5-8-6-3
- <7, (5, 0), 2>: Chords (5, 0) in cycle 1-5-6-3-1
- <8, (8, 0), 5>: Chords (8, 0) in cycle 1-5-6-3-1

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [7].
