Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 20) (15, 1) (15, 9) (15, 6) (27, 26) (27, 13) (14, 28) (14, 19) (14, 4) (17, 19) (20, 15) (20, 7) (20, 2) (20, 5) (9, 15) (9, 22) (9, 29) (9, 13) (22, 9) (22, 4) (22, 8) (11, 24) (11, 21) (28, 14) (28, 24) (28, 10) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 20) (7, 0) (7, 26) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 13) (1, 23) (29, 9) (2, 20) (2, 12) (2, 6) (18, 3) (19, 14) (19, 17) (19, 24) (12, 2) (12, 21) (12, 26) (10, 28) (10, 26) (10, 8) (26, 27) (26, 7) (26, 12) (26, 10) (24, 11) (24, 28) (24, 19) (24, 13) (16, 1) (16, 13) (16, 23) (21, 11) (21, 12) (21, 5) (21, 4) (3, 0) (3, 18) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 14) (4, 22) (4, 21) (4, 3) (4, 6) (5, 20) (5, 21) (5, 8) (8, 22) (8, 10) (8, 3) (8, 5) (23, 1) (23, 16) (13, 27) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 24) (13, 16) (6, 15) (6, 2) (6, 4) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <15, 20, 7, 0, 3, 18>
        - Cycle 2: <14, 28, 10, 8, 5, 21>
        - Cycle 3: <14, 28, 10, 26, 27, 13>
        - Cycle 4: <19, 24, 11, 21, 5, 20>
        - Cycle 5: <11, 24, 13, 27, 26, 10>
        - Cycle 6: <20, 5, 8, 22, 9, 15>
        - Cycle 7: <22, 9, 13, 27, 26, 12>
        - Cycle 8: <3, 0, 7, 20, 15, 1>
        - Cycle 9: <4, 21, 5, 20, 15, 1>
        - Cycle 10: <4, 21, 11, 24, 28, 14>
        - Cycle 11: <20, 15, 6, 2, 12, 26>
        - Cycle 12: <13, 27, 26, 10, 8, 3>
        - Cycle 13: <9, 15, 20, 2, 6, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - <15, 20, 7, 0, 3, 18> has one chord: (15, 1)
        - <14, 28, 10, 8, 5, 21> has one chord: (14, 19)
        - <14, 28, 10, 26, 27, 13> has one chord: (14, 4)
        - <19, 24, 11, 21, 5, 20> has one chord: (19, 17)
        - <11, 24, 13, 27, 26, 10> has one chord: (11, 21)
        - <20, 5, 8, 22, 9, 15> has one chord: (20, 2)
        - <22, 9, 13, 27, 26, 12> has one chord: (22, 4)
        - <3, 0, 7, 20, 15, 1> has one chord: (3, 4)
        - <4, 21, 5, 20, 15, 1> has one chord: (4, 6)
        - <4, 21, 11, 24, 28, 14> has one chord: (4, 3)
        - <20, 15, 6, 2, 12, 26> has one chord: (20, 7)
        - <13, 27, 26, 10, 8, 3> has one chord: (13, 16)
        - <9, 15, 20, 2, 6, 4> has one chord: (9, 22)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
