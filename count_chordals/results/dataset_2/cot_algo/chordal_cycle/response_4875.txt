Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 17) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 10) (2, 16) (2, 17) (18, 14) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 10) (0, 3) (0, 15) (0, 13) (14, 18) (14, 16) (1, 15) (1, 6) (1, 11) (15, 0) (15, 1) (8, 10) (8, 6) (9, 17) (9, 16) (9, 3) (6, 12) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 3) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 8) (10, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (5, 12) (5, 17) (16, 2) (16, 14) (16, 9) (17, 4) (17, 2) (17, 9) (17, 5) (19, 4) (19, 13) (13, 0) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 19) 

Response:
First, let's go through step 1 to list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 10-0-3-12-5-17-9-16-14-18-4 (Length 10)
- Cycle 2: 10-0-15-1-6-12-3-9-17-5-14-16-2 (Length 12)

Next, let's move on to step 2 to check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (10, 3): <10, (10, 3), 12, 5, 17, 9, 16, 14, 18, 4>
- Cycle 2 has one chord (15, 6): <10, 0, 15, (15, 6), 12, 3, 9, 17, 5, 14, 16, 2>

Now, we proceed to step 3 to count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
