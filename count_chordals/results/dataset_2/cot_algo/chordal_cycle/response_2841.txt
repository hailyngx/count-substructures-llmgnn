Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 2) (16, 13) (16, 4) (3, 15) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 4) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 17) (4, 11) (4, 16) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 18) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 2) (2, 11) (2, 7) (2, 18) (2, 14) (2, 17) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 2) (18, 8) (13, 16) (13, 1) (17, 15) (17, 2) (17, 0) (8, 15) (8, 18) (19, 3) (19, 15) (19, 12) (19, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (6, 15) (14, 2) (14, 1) (14, 12) (10, 7) (0, 17) (0, 5) (9, 19) (9, 12) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 14) (12, 9) (5, 11) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <11, 4, 16, 13, 1>
- Cycle 2: <11, 4, 3, 15, 17>
- Cycle 3: <11, 2, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle 4: <11, 4, 7, 2, 14>
- Cycle 5: <11, 2, 17, 15, 3>
- Cycle 6: <11, 4, 18, 8, 15>
- Cycle 7: <11, 2, 14, 1, 13>
- Cycle 8: <16, 13, 1, 14, 2>
- Cycle 9: <3, 15, 17, 2, 14>
- Cycle 10: <3, 4, 7, 18, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycle with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycle) is:
<11, 2, 7, 4, 3> with chord (4, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

As there is one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
