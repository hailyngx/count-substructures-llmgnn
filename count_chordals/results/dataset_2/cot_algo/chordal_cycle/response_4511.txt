Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 19) (8, 13) (8, 10) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 19) (4, 12) (18, 11) (18, 17) (1, 13) (1, 15) (1, 14) (1, 10) (15, 1) (15, 10) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 0) (10, 14) (19, 9) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 17) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 16) (12, 0) (0, 10) (0, 12) (0, 17) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 19) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 7) (16, 12) (3, 9) (3, 2) (14, 1) (14, 10) (7, 6) (7, 2) (17, 18) (17, 19) (17, 0) (17, 5) (11, 9) (11, 18) (11, 5) (5, 0) (5, 17) (5, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (6, 9, 3, 2, 6)
        - Cycle 2: (6, 9, 19, 13, 1, 6)
        - Cycle 3: (10, 14, 1, 13, 19, 10)
        - Cycle 4: (10, 15, 1, 13, 19, 10)
        - Cycle 5: (10, 1, 13, 19, 2, 10)
        - Cycle 6: (10, 1, 14, 13, 19, 10)
        - Cycle 7: (10, 1, 15, 10)
        - Cycle 8: (10, 15, 1, 14, 10)
        - Cycle 9: (10, 15, 1, 13, 19, 10)
        - Cycle 10: (9, 19, 13, 1, 15, 9)
        - Cycle 11: (9, 19, 2, 6, 7, 9)
        - Cycle 12: (9, 19, 13, 1, 10, 9)
        - Cycle 13: (9, 19, 13, 1, 14, 9)
        - Cycle 14: (9, 3, 2, 6, 7, 9)
        - Cycle 15: (9, 11, 18, 17, 0, 9)
        - Cycle 16: (9, 11, 18, 17, 5, 9)
        - Cycle 17: (8, 13, 1, 15, 10, 8)
        - Cycle 18: (13, 1, 14, 10, 0, 13)
        - Cycle 19: (13, 1, 15, 10, 8, 13)
        - Cycle 20: (13, 1, 10, 8, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (13, 19), 10, 15>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (13, 19), 10, 14>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <10, (1, 13), 19, 14>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <10, (1, 13), 19, 15>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, (19, 13), 1, 10>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, (19, 13), 1, 14>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <9, (19, 2), 6, 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <9, (19, 13), 1, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 20 cycles found in total. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is 20 - 8 = 12.

Final answer: [12]
