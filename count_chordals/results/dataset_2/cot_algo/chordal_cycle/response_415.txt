Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 9) (15, 24) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 8) (4, 1) (4, 29) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 10) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 0) (22, 16) (22, 0) (22, 3) (20, 25) (20, 1) (20, 8) (20, 24) (25, 20) (28, 29) (28, 11) (28, 24) (28, 10) (29, 4) (29, 28) (29, 13) (29, 5) (2, 15) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 27) (8, 20) (8, 2) (8, 9) (19, 18) (19, 26) (19, 11) (19, 9) (26, 19) (26, 23) (26, 11) (11, 28) (11, 19) (11, 26) (1, 4) (1, 20) (1, 12) (17, 13) (6, 18) (6, 21) (21, 6) (21, 13) (21, 23) (9, 15) (9, 8) (9, 19) (13, 29) (13, 17) (13, 21) (13, 16) (23, 26) (23, 21) (23, 14) (14, 23) (14, 12) (16, 22) (16, 13) (16, 5) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 10) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 0) (0, 18) (0, 22) (0, 3) (0, 5) (10, 7) (10, 28) (10, 12) (24, 15) (24, 20) (24, 28) (5, 29) (5, 16) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (15, 27, 8, 2, 15)
- Cycle 2: (4, 29, 13, 21, 6, 18, 0, 4)
- Cycle 3: (7, 3, 22, 0, 18, 19, 26, 11, 7)
- Cycle 4: (22, 3, 7, 10, 28, 24, 15, 2, 22)
- Cycle 5: (20, 25, 28, 24, 15, 9, 19, 26, 20)
- Cycle 6: (25, 20, 1, 4, 29, 5, 16, 22, 25)
- Cycle 7: (28, 29, 5, 0, 18, 19, 26, 11, 28)
- Cycle 8: (29, 13, 21, 23, 26, 19, 9, 8, 29)
- Cycle 9: (2, 15, 24, 28, 11, 19, 9, 8, 2)
- Cycle 10: (8, 27, 15, 24, 28, 10, 12, 1, 8)
- Cycle 11: (19, 18, 6, 21, 13, 29, 5, 0, 19)

Step 2:
- <1, (2, 15)>
- <2, (4, 29)>
- <3, (7, 3)>
- <4, (22, 0)>
- <5, (20, 25)>
- <6, (25, 4)>
- <7, (28, 5)>
- <8, (13, 21)>
- <9, (2, 15)>
- <10, (8, 27)>
- <11, (18, 6)>

Step 3:
- There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [11].
