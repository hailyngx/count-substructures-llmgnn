Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-6-9-1
- Cycle 2: 2-6-9-8-2
- Cycle 3: 3-6-7-4-3
- Cycle 4: 3-7-5-8-3
- Cycle 5: 4-7-5-0-4
- Cycle 6: 5-1-2-8-5
- Cycle 7: 5-4-7-3-5

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-6-9-1 has chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 2: 2-6-9-8-2 has chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 3: 3-6-7-4-3 has chord (6, 4)
- Cycle 4: 3-7-5-8-3 has chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 5: 4-7-5-0-4 has chord (7, 5)
- Cycle 6: 5-1-2-8-5 has chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 7: 5-4-7-3-5 has chord (4, 3)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<1, (3, 9), 3)>
<2, (6, 8), 9)>
<3, (6, 4), 7)>
<4, (7, 8), 5)>
<5, (7, 5), 4)>
<6, (1, 8), 5)>
<7, (4, 3), 5)>
