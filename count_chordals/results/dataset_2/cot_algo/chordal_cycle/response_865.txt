Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 7, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 4, 1, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 0, 3, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 6, 1, 4, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 8, 2, 9)
- Cycle 6: (4, 7, 0, 1, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 2, 3, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 0, 3, 4, 7)
- Cycle 9: (8, 2, 5, 3, 8)
- Cycle 10: (1, 6, 9, 7, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 4, 3, 0, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, (6, 9), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
