Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 24) (5, 21) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (15, 19) (15, 25) (15, 17) (15, 11) (27, 29) (27, 26) (0, 7) (0, 28) (24, 5) (24, 22) (24, 28) (24, 14) (26, 27) (26, 21) (26, 17) (26, 4) (7, 0) (7, 11) (13, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 28) (6, 29) (10, 9) (10, 19) (10, 20) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 22) (19, 18) (19, 3) (22, 24) (22, 19) (22, 12) (4, 26) (4, 21) (4, 2) (16, 23) (29, 27) (29, 6) (29, 8) (29, 12) (11, 15) (11, 7) (11, 8) (18, 19) (18, 8) (25, 15) (25, 12) (3, 19) (3, 14) (3, 2) (14, 24) (14, 1) (14, 3) (14, 8) (28, 0) (28, 24) (28, 1) (28, 17) (23, 16) (23, 21) (23, 20) (8, 29) (8, 11) (8, 18) (8, 14) (12, 22) (12, 29) (12, 25) (12, 20) (20, 10) (20, 23) (20, 12) (21, 5) (21, 26) (21, 4) (21, 23) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (17, 15) (17, 26) (17, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Possible cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. (5, 9, 10, 19, 15)
2. (5, 9, 10, 20, 23)
3. (5, 21, 26, 17, 15)
4. (5, 21, 26, 4, 2)
5. (5, 21, 23, 20, 10)
6. (9, 5, 24, 22, 19)

Step 2:
Among these cycles, let's check for cycles with exactly one chord:
1. (5, 9, 10, 19, 15) has a chord (10, 19)
2. (5, 21, 26, 17, 15) has a chord (26, 15)
3. (9, 5, 24, 22, 19) has a chord (24, 19)

Step 3:
So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <5, 9, 10, 19, 15>
2. <5, 21, 26, 17, 15>
3. <9, 5, 24, 22, 19>
