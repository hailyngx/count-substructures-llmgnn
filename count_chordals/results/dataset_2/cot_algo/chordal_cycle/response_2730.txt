Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 2, 5, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 1, 5, 3, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 3, 6, 0, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 6, 3, 5, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 9, 1, 5, 7)
- Cycle 6: (1, 0, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 7: (3, 5, 8, 0, 3)
- Cycle 8: (8, 7, 6, 0, 8)
- Cycle 9: (6, 0, 1, 5, 6)
- Cycle 10: (0, 2, 5, 8, 0)
- Cycle 11: (2, 7, 6, 0, 2)
- Cycle 12: (9, 7, 4, 1, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (5, 4), 2>
- Cycle 2: <2, (5, 1), 3>
- Cycle 3: <4, (0, 3), 6>
- Cycle 4: <5, (3, 7), 6>
- Cycle 5: <6, (1, 7), 9>
- Cycle 6: <7, (1, 8), 5>
- Cycle 7: <8, (0, 5), 3>
- Cycle 8: <9, (0, 8), 7>
- Cycle 9: <10, (1, 6), 8>
- Cycle 10: <11, (2, 5), 7>
- Cycle 11: <12, (4, 0), 3>
- Cycle 12: <13, (1, 4), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [12].
