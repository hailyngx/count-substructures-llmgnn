Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, (18, 22), 2): Chord goes between nodes 18 and 22 in the cycle (14, 16, 18, 22, 27, 19, 2).
- <2, (18, 16), 7): Chord goes between nodes 18 and 16 in the cycle (14, 17, 7, 16, 18, 22, 18).
- <3, (7, 5), 1): Chord goes between nodes 7 and 5 in the cycle (7, 5, 1, 11, 29).
- <4, (25, 0), 20): Chord goes between nodes 25 and 0 in the cycle (3, 25, 0, 20, 13).
- <5, (25, 0), 8): Chord goes between nodes 25 and 0 in the cycle (3, 25, 0, 8, 10).
- <6, (7, 16), 18): Chord goes between nodes 7 and 16 in the cycle (7, 16, 18, 22, 3).
- <7, (18, 22), 3): Chord goes between nodes 18 and 22 in the cycle (7, 16, 18, 22, 3, 28).
- <8, (25, 0), 20): Chord goes between nodes 25 and 0 in the cycle (25, 0, 20, 13, 21).

- <10, (18, 16), 19): Chord goes between nodes 18 and 16 in the cycle (18, 16, 19, 27, 22).
- <11, (18, 16), 19): Chord goes between nodes 18 and 16 in the cycle (18, 16, 19, 27, 22).
- <12, (18, 16), 7): Chord goes between nodes 18 and 16 in the cycle (18, 16, 7, 6, 23).
- <13, (18, 16), 19): Chord goes between nodes 18 and 16 in the cycle (18, 16, 19, 27, 22).
- <14, (18, 16), 19): Chord goes between nodes 18 and 16 in the cycle (18, 16, 19, 27, 22).
- <15, (18, 16), 7): Chord goes between nodes 18 and 16 in the cycle (18, 16, 7, 5, 1).

- <17, (3, 22), 18): Chord goes between nodes 3 and 22 in the cycle (3, 22, 18, 16, 7).
- <18, (3, 22), 18): Chord goes between nodes 3 and 22 in the cycle (3, 22, 18, 16, 7).
- <19, (25, 3), 22): Chord goes between nodes 25 and 3 in the cycle (25, 3, 22, 18, 2).
- <20, (25, 3), 28): Chord goes between nodes 25 and 3 in the cycle (25, 3, 28, 26, 29).
- <21, (25, 0), 20): Chord goes between nodes 25 and 0 in the cycle (25, 0, 20, 13, 24).
- <22, (25, 0), 8): Chord goes between nodes 25 and 0 in the cycle (25, 0, 8, 10, 1).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 22 chordal 4-cycles in the graph. So, the final number is [22].
