Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 3) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 1) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 1) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 6) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 13) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 14, 13, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 11, 10, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 0, 7, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 0, 6, 2, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 14, 13, 3, 9)
- Cycle 6: (4, 12, 2, 0, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 10, 1, 11, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 12, 2, 6, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 3, 0, 6, 7)
- Cycle 10: (8, 13, 14, 9, 8)
- Cycle 11: (8, 10, 1, 11, 8)
- Cycle 12: (13, 14, 9, 8, 13)
- Cycle 13: (10, 11, 1, 10)
- Cycle 14: (12, 2, 6, 7, 12)
- Cycle 15: (0, 6, 2, 12, 0)

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles (with exactly one chord):
- <5, (9, 14), 13>
- <5, (11, 10), 4>
- <5, (4, 0), 7>
- <5, (0, 6), 2>
- <9, (14, 13), 5>
- <14, (13, 9), 8>
- <4, (12, 2), 10>
- <10, (1, 11), 8>
- <7, (12, 2), 6>
- <8, (13, 14), 9>
- <8, (10, 1), 11>
- <13, (14, 9), 8>
- <12, (2, 6), 7>
- <0, (6, 2), 12>

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [1]
