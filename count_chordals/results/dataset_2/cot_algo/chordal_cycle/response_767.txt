Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 28) (9, 27) (26, 20) (1, 14) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 5) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 12) (18, 23) (18, 14) (18, 28) (18, 13) (11, 13) (11, 20) (28, 9) (28, 18) (28, 17) (28, 24) (5, 21) (13, 18) (13, 11) (13, 29) (13, 6) (7, 25) (7, 3) (7, 24) (25, 7) (25, 15) (15, 25) (15, 16) (15, 23) (16, 21) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 29) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 0) (10, 19) (6, 13) (6, 0) (6, 12) (24, 28) (24, 7) (24, 19) (19, 10) (19, 24) (19, 22) (19, 2) (22, 19) (22, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 22) (3, 17) (17, 28) (17, 3) (17, 23) (17, 27) (2, 19) (2, 27) (27, 9) (27, 17) (27, 2) (27, 29) (29, 13) (29, 16) (29, 27) (23, 18) (23, 15) (23, 17) (23, 20) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 18) (20, 26) (20, 21) (20, 11) (20, 23) (20, 12) (12, 8) (12, 6) (12, 20) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

In this graph, there are several cycles of length 4 or more. Here is a list of some of the cycles: 
- Cycle 1: (9, 28, 18, 13)
- Cycle 2: (21, 16, 15, 23)
- Cycle 3: (4, 14, 18, 28)
- Cycle 4: (8, 16, 21, 20)
- Cycle 5: (13, 18, 14, 8)
- Cycle 6: (7, 3, 4, 14)
- Cycle 7: (25, 7, 3, 22)
- Cycle 8: (0, 8, 14, 4)
- Cycle 9: (10, 0, 8, 12)
- Cycle 10: (19, 10, 0, 6)
- Cycle 11: (24, 28, 18, 13)
- Cycle 12: (16, 21, 20, 12)
- Cycle 13: (6, 13, 18, 14)
- Cycle 14: (15, 16, 21, 20)
- Cycle 15: (23, 18, 14, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Among the cycles listed above, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2: (21, 16, 15, 23) ---> Chord (16, 23)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found.
Therefore, the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <21, (16, 23), 15>
