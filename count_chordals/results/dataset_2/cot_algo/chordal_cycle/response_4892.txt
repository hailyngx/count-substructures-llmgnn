Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (15, 27) (15, 2) (27, 15) (27, 4) (27, 18) (27, 14) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 22) (3, 1) (3, 26) (8, 23) (8, 9) (8, 25) (8, 11) (23, 8) (23, 13) (23, 19) (9, 8) (9, 22) (22, 1) (22, 9) (22, 6) (22, 29) (22, 7) (24, 28) (24, 5) (24, 21) (26, 3) (26, 2) (26, 20) (26, 16) (17, 20) (17, 6) (17, 5) (20, 26) (20, 17) (20, 12) (20, 10) (4, 27) (4, 10) (11, 8) (11, 0) (28, 24) (28, 18) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 10) (0, 6) (16, 26) (16, 0) (16, 21) (21, 24) (21, 16) (21, 2) (2, 15) (2, 26) (2, 21) (2, 12) (12, 20) (12, 2) (12, 5) (6, 1) (6, 22) (6, 17) (6, 0) (10, 20) (10, 4) (10, 0) (7, 22) (13, 23) (13, 25) (13, 18) (25, 8) (25, 13) (25, 19) (5, 24) (5, 17) (5, 12) (14, 27) (14, 1) (18, 27) (18, 28) (18, 13) (18, 29) (19, 23) (19, 25) (29, 22) (29, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <15, 27, 4, 10, 20, 26, 2>
        - <8, 23, 13, 25, 19, 29, 22, 6, 0, 16, 21, 24, 5, 17>
        - <1, 3, 26, 16, 21, 24, 28, 18, 13, 25, 19, 29, 22, 6>
        - <22, 6, 0, 16, 26, 3, 1, 14, 27, 4, 10, 20, 12, 5>
        - <27, 4, 10, 20, 12, 5, 17, 6, 1, 14, 27>
        - <18, 28, 24, 21, 16, 26, 2, 15, 27, 14, 1, 22, 29>
        - <25, 19, 29, 22, 6, 0, 16, 26, 2, 12, 20, 10, 4>
        
Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <15, 27, 4, 10, 20, 26, 2> has a chord between 4 and 26
        - <8, 23, 13, 25, 19, 29, 22, 6, 0, 16, 21, 24, 5, 17> has a chord between 25 and 16
        - <1, 3, 26, 16, 21, 24, 28, 18, 13, 25, 19, 29, 22, 6> doesn't have exactly one chord
        - <22, 6, 0, 16, 26, 3, 1, 14, 27, 4, 10, 20, 12, 5> has a chord between 3 and 14
        - <27, 4, 10, 20, 12, 5, 17, 6, 1, 14, 27> doesn't have exactly one chord
        - <18, 28, 24, 21, 16, 26, 2, 15, 27, 14, 1, 22, 29> doesn't have exactly one chord
        - <25, 19, 29, 22, 6, 0, 16, 26, 2, 12, 20, 10, 4> doesn't have exactly one chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
        - <15, 27, 4, 10, 20, 26, 2> with a chord between 4 and 26
        - <8, 23, 13, 25, 19, 29, 22, 6, 0, 16, 21, 24, 5, 17> with a chord between 25 and 16
        - <22, 6, 0, 16, 26, 3, 1, 14, 27, 4, 10, 20, 12, 5> with a chord between 3 and 14
