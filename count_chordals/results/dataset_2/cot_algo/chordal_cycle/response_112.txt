Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 13) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 14) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 10) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 12) (14, 1) (14, 4) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 10) (12, 11) (12, 13) (13, 3) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (10, 1) (10, 5) (10, 8) (10, 14) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more are: 
- Cycle 1: (1, 11, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 11, 7, 4, 14, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 2, 3, 7, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 2, 5, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 10, 5, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 14, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 14, 5, 10, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 14, 11, 7, 1)
- Cycle 9: (4, 7, 11, 14, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 13, 3, 7, 4)
- Cycle 11: (5, 4, 7, 11, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 10, 1, 14, 5)

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 2: (1, 11, 7, 4, 14, 1) - Chord: (7, 14)
- Cycle 6: (1, 14, 4, 7, 1) - Chord: (1, 7)

Step 3: 
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, 11, 7, 4, 14, 1>
- <1, 14, 4, 7, 1>
