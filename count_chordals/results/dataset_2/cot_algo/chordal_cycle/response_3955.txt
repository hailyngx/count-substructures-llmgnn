This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 18) (5, 1) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 15) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 16) (4, 21) (7, 9) (7, 11) (7, 14) (8, 29) (8, 15) (13, 12) (13, 25) (13, 27) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 28) (27, 13) (27, 14) (19, 26) (26, 19) (26, 18) (26, 21) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 17) (1, 16) (1, 14) (17, 1) (17, 3) (28, 12) (28, 18) (20, 21) (11, 5) (11, 7) (11, 23) (11, 3) (23, 11) (23, 2) (3, 17) (3, 11) (3, 0) (2, 23) (2, 22) (2, 10) (2, 0) (22, 2) (22, 10) (22, 25) (16, 4) (16, 1) (16, 21) (16, 29) (21, 4) (21, 26) (21, 20) (21, 16) (6, 24) (24, 6) (24, 10) (25, 13) (25, 22) (25, 0) (25, 15) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 25) (15, 9) (15, 8) (15, 25) (15, 18) (29, 8) (29, 16) (29, 14) (18, 5) (18, 26) (18, 28) (18, 15) (14, 7) (14, 27) (14, 1) (14, 29) (10, 2) (10, 22) (10, 24) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <5, 9, 1, 5> 
        - Cycle 2: <5, 11, 7, 9, 5> 
        - Cycle 3: <5, 12, 13, 27, 14, 1, 5> 
        - Cycle 4: <5, 18, 26, 21, 4, 16, 1, 5> 
        - Cycle 5: <5, 18, 26, 21, 16, 29, 14, 1, 5>
        - Cycle 6: <9, 5, 12, 13, 27, 14, 7, 9> 
        - Cycle 7: <9, 15, 25, 13, 12, 5, 1, 9>
        - Cycle 8: <9, 15, 25, 0, 3, 17, 1, 9>
        - Cycle 9: <4, 16, 29, 14, 7, 11, 5, 1, 4>
        - Cycle 10: <7, 9, 15, 25, 13, 12, 5, 11, 7>
        - Cycle 11: <12, 5, 18, 26, 21, 16, 4, 21, 12>
        - Cycle 12: <13, 12, 28, 18, 26, 21, 4, 16, 13>
        - Cycle 13: <13, 27, 14, 29, 16, 21, 26, 18, 13>
        - Cycle 14: <19, 26, 18, 15, 9, 7, 11, 3, 17, 1, 16, 4, 21, 20, 26, 19>
        - Cycle 15: <8, 29, 16, 4, 21, 26, 18, 28, 12, 13, 27, 14, 29, 8>
        - Cycle 16: <6, 24, 10, 2, 23, 11, 7, 14, 1, 17, 3, 0, 25, 15, 8, 6>
        - Cycle 17: <10, 2, 23, 11, 7, 14, 29, 16, 21, 26, 18, 15, 25, 0, 3, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        For the cycles listed above, the following are chordal 4-cycles: 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 1, 5> with chord (1, 9)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 11, 7, 9, 5> with chord (11, 7)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <9, 5, 12, 13, 27, 14, 7, 9> with chord (12, 14)
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 16, 29, 14, 7, 11, 5, 1, 4> with chord (16, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [4].
