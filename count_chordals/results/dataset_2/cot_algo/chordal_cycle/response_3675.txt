Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (22, 26) (22, 19) (9, 26) (9, 18) (9, 1) (26, 22) (26, 9) (26, 20) (26, 11) (26, 27) (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 21) (17, 14) (17, 24) (17, 23) (17, 27) (17, 11) (5, 0) (5, 27) (10, 11) (10, 21) (10, 18) (10, 28) (11, 26) (11, 17) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 25) (28, 10) (28, 27) (28, 15) (29, 7) (4, 14) (4, 27) (4, 0) (4, 25) (27, 26) (27, 17) (27, 5) (27, 28) (27, 4) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 8) (21, 14) (21, 10) (21, 12) (2, 3) (2, 24) (12, 14) (12, 21) (12, 25) (19, 22) (19, 3) (19, 15) (18, 9) (18, 10) (18, 15) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 8) (15, 28) (15, 19) (15, 18) (15, 24) (7, 29) (20, 26) (20, 6) (6, 20) (6, 0) (24, 17) (24, 2) (24, 15) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (23, 17) (23, 25) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 16) (8, 25) (16, 8) (25, 11) (25, 4) (25, 12) (25, 23) (25, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (26, 20, 6, 0, 5, 27, 26)
        - Cycle 2: (26, 20, 6, 0, 4, 25, 26)
        - Cycle 3: (26, 20, 6, 0, 4, 14, 17, 27, 26)
        - Cycle 4: (26, 20, 6, 0, 4, 14, 21, 10, 11, 26)
        - Cycle 5: (26, 20, 6, 0, 4, 14, 21, 10, 18, 9, 26)
        - Cycle 6: (26, 20, 6, 0, 4, 27, 17, 14, 21, 10, 11, 26)
        - Cycle 7: (26, 20, 6, 0, 4, 27, 17, 14, 21, 10, 18, 9, 26)
        - Cycle 8: (26, 20, 6, 0, 5, 27, 17, 14, 4, 25, 26)
        - Cycle 9: (26, 27, 17, 14, 4, 0, 6, 20, 26)
        - Cycle 10: (26, 27, 17, 14, 4, 0, 5, 27, 26)
        - Cycle 11: (26, 27, 17, 14, 21, 10, 11, 26)
        - Cycle 12: (26, 27, 17, 14, 21, 10, 18, 9, 26)
        - Cycle 13: (26, 27, 17, 14, 4, 0, 5, 27, 4, 25, 26)
        - Cycle 14: (26, 27, 17, 14, 21, 10, 11, 1, 8, 3, 19, 26)
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Out of the listed cycles, the following is a chordal 4-cycle:
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - The total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
        
Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<26, 27, 17, 14, 21, 10, 11, 1>
