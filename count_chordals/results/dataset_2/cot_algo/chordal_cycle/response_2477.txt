Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 11) (8, 2) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 11) (13, 14) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (14, 12) (14, 13) (14, 4) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 10) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more based on the given edges:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 11, 13)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 1, 11)
- Cycle 3: (5, 13, 14, 12)
- Cycle 4: (9, 11, 1, 7)
- Cycle 5: (9, 13, 14, 12)
- Cycle 6: (10, 11, 1, 7)
- Cycle 7: (10, 13, 14, 12)
- Cycle 8: (11, 13, 14, 12)
- Cycle 9: (7, 5, 9, 11)
- Cycle 10: (7, 1, 11, 13)
- Cycle 11: (12, 9, 11, 1)
- Cycle 12: (12, 14, 13, 11)
- Cycle 13: (2, 9, 11, 1)
- Cycle 14: (2, 3, 6, 0)
- Cycle 15: (8, 11, 13, 14)
- Cycle 16: (13, 14, 4, 10)
- Cycle 17: (0, 7, 1, 4)
- Cycle 18: (1, 7, 0, 6)
- Cycle 19: (6, 0, 4, 10)
- Cycle 20: (6, 3, 2, 1)
- Cycle 21: (14, 13, 9, 5)
- Cycle 22: (3, 5, 9, 12)
- Cycle 23: (4, 10, 11, 8)

Step 2:
Identifying the chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (2, 11), 3)>
- <2, (8, 13), 1)>
- <7, (0, 4), 6)>
- <13, (5, 9), 14)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles found, which is [19].
