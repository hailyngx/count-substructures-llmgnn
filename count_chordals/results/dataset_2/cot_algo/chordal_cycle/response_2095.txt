Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 6) (7, 11) (7, 12) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 6) (12, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 10) (8, 10) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 1) (4, 5) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 3) (4, 14) (14, 11) (14, 12) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 6) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 10) (3, 8) (3, 4) (3, 14) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 13) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 13, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 10, 2, 5, 9)
- Cycle 3: (10, 11, 14, 4, 10)
- Cycle 4: (11, 7, 12, 6, 11)
- Cycle 5: (7, 11, 10, 2, 7)
- Cycle 6: (12, 7, 11, 14, 12)
- Cycle 7: (2, 5, 13, 1, 2)
- Cycle 8: (8, 10, 2, 5, 8)
- Cycle 9: (13, 9, 10, 2, 13)
- Cycle 10: (4, 5, 13, 1, 4)
- Cycle 11: (14, 4, 5, 2, 14)
- Cycle 12: (0, 8, 10, 2, 0)
- Cycle 13: (3, 10, 2, 5, 3)
- Cycle 14: (1, 13, 9, 10, 1)
- Cycle 15: (6, 11, 10, 2, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, (13, 9), 10, 2, 1>
- <2, (10, 5), 13, 1, 2>
- <3, (10, 5), 2, 10, 3>
- <4, (14, 5), 13, 1, 4>
- <5, (2, 9), 13, 1, 5>
- <6, (11, 7), 12, 6, 11>
- <7, (4, 13), 1, 4, 5>
- <8, (8, 10), 2, 5, 8>
- <9, (2, 10), 5, 9, 2>
- <10, (10, 11), 14, 4, 10>
- <11, (10, 2), 5, 9, 10>
- <12, (2, 5), 13, 1, 2>
- <13, (14, 4), 5, 2, 14>
- <14, (7, 11), 10, 2, 7>
- <15, (12, 7), 11, 14, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found which have exactly one chord.

Thus, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [15].
