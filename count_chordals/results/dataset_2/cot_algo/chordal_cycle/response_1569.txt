Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: 0-7-1-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-7-5-8-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-8-4-0
- Cycle 4: 0-5-7-2-0
- Cycle 5: 0-4-8-5-0
- Cycle 6: 0-4-2-7-0
- Cycle 7: 1-7-2-8-1
- Cycle 8: 1-8-5-7-1
- Cycle 9: 2-6-4-8-2
- Cycle 10: 3-6-2-4-3
- Cycle 11: 3-4-8-5-3
- Cycle 12: 4-8-5-7-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1: <1, (7, 2), 0>
- Cycle 2: <2, (7, 5), 0>
- Cycle 3: <5, (8, 4), 0>
- Cycle 4: <7, (5, 2), 0>
- Cycle 5: <4, (8, 5), 0>
- Cycle 6: <7, (4, 2), 0>
- Cycle 7: <1, (7, 8), 2>
- Cycle 8: <1, (8, 7), 5>
- Cycle 9: <6, (4, 8), 2>
- Cycle 10: <3, (6, 4), 2>
- Cycle 11: <3, (8, 5), 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, (8, 5), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Since all cycles have exactly one chord, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
