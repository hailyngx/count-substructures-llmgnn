Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-1-7-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-8-5-2-0
- Cycle 3: 1-6-7-4-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-7-0-1
- Cycle 5: 2-5-8-4-0-2
- Cycle 6: 2-5-8-7-1-2
- Cycle 7: 3-0-4-8-3
- Cycle 8: 3-0-4-7-6-3
- Cycle 9: 3-0-9-8-4-3
- Cycle 10: 3-2-5-8-4-3
- Cycle 11: 6-7-1-4-6
- Cycle 12: 6-7-0-4-6
- Cycle 13: 6-7-4-8-6
- Cycle 14: 7-4-8-5-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (3, 8), 6> has one chord (3, 8)
- <2, (0, 4), 5> has one chord (0, 4)
- <3, (0, 9), 8> has one chord (0, 9)
- <5, (8, 7), 2> has one chord (8, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
