Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <2, 9, 6, 0>
- <7, 4, 2, 8>
- <1, 5, 9, 6>
- <1, 5, 9, 8>
- <1, 5, 9, 2>
- <1, 5, 9, 1>
- <6, 9, 2, 7>
- <6, 9, 2, 8>
- <7, 4, 3, 8>
- <7, 4, 3, 7>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <2, 9, 6, 0> has no chord
- <7, 4, 2, 8> has no chord
- <1, 5, 9, 6> has chord (1, 6)
- <1, 5, 9, 8> has chord (1, 8)
- <1, 5, 9, 2> has chord (5, 9)
- <1, 5, 9, 1> has chord (5, 9)
- <6, 9, 2, 7> has chord (6, 2)
- <6, 9, 2, 8> has chord (6, 2)
- <7, 4, 3, 8> has chord (4, 8)
- <7, 4, 3, 7> has chord (4, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, 5, 9, 6>
<1, 5, 9, 8>
<1, 5, 9, 2>
<1, 5, 9, 1>
<6, 9, 2, 7>
<7, 4, 3, 8>
