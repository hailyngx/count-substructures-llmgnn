Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 18) (9, 17) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 15) (17, 9) (17, 19) (17, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 18) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 15) (3, 10) (3, 8) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (11, 14) (11, 10) (11, 2) (15, 14) (15, 3) (15, 12) (13, 5) (18, 9) (18, 1) (18, 19) (19, 17) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 4) (19, 12) (12, 15) (12, 19) (16, 4) (16, 6) (2, 17) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 19) (4, 19) (4, 16) (4, 0) (6, 10) (6, 16) (0, 5) (0, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (7, 5) (7, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 17, 2, 1, 18, 9)
- Cycle 2: (3, 1, 18, 9, 17, 2, 1)
- Cycle 3: (10, 1, 18, 9, 17, 2, 11, 10)
- Cycle 4: (15, 3, 1, 18, 9, 17, 19, 12, 15)
- Cycle 5: (14, 7, 5, 9, 17, 19, 14)
- Cycle 6: (19, 17, 9, 5, 0, 4, 19)
- Cycle 7: (1, 18, 19, 17, 9, 5, 0, 4, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 18, 9, 5, 0, 4, 16, 6, 10, 1)
- Cycle 9: (2, 17, 9, 5, 0, 4, 19, 12, 15, 2)
- Cycle 10: (4, 0, 5, 7, 14, 15, 12, 19, 4)
- Cycle 11: (9, 5, 7, 14, 15, 3, 1, 10, 6, 16, 9)
- Cycle 12: (14, 15, 3, 10, 6, 16, 4, 19, 17, 2, 11, 14)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 17, 16> (Chord: (9, 16))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, 1, 18, 19> (Chord: (1, 19))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <10, 6, 16, 9> (Chord: (6, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <14, 15, 3, 10> (Chord: (15, 10))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 8 chordless cycles found.

Thus, the final answer is [8].
