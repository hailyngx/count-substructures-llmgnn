Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 18) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 10) (13, 18) (4, 8) (4, 14) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 16) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 11) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 10) (17, 1) (17, 16) (17, 2) (15, 11) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 0) (16, 7) (16, 17) (18, 5) (18, 13) (0, 9) (0, 19) (0, 3) (0, 2) (10, 13) (10, 1) (10, 3) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 1) (11, 15) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 17) (2, 0) (2, 14) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 19) (14, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 9, 2, 0, 5)
- (5, 11, 1, 10, 5)
- (5, 14, 4, 8, 5)
- (9, 2, 7, 12, 9)
- (9, 5, 18, 13, 9)
- (6, 3, 0, 9, 6)
- (6, 13, 18, 5, 6)
- (8, 4, 14, 19, 8)
- (8, 7, 16, 17, 8)
- (13, 6, 3, 0, 13)
- (13, 18, 5, 14, 13)
- (4, 8, 7, 2, 4)
- (4, 14, 19, 0, 4)
- (7, 2, 0, 3, 7)
- (7, 12, 11, 5, 7)
- (7, 16, 17, 2, 7)
- (12, 7, 8, 4, 12)
- (12, 11, 1, 17, 12)
- (1, 17, 16, 7, 1)
- (1, 11, 12, 7, 1)
- (1, 10, 3, 0, 1)
- (17, 1, 10, 3, 17)
- (17, 16, 7, 12, 17)
- (15, 11, 1, 17, 15)
- (19, 8, 7, 12, 19)
- (19, 14, 4, 8, 19)
- (19, 0, 3, 6, 19)
- (16, 7, 8, 4, 16)
- (16, 17, 1, 11, 16)
- (18, 13, 6, 3, 18)
- (0, 9, 2, 7, 0)
- (0, 19, 14, 5, 0)
- (10, 13, 18, 5, 10)
- (10, 1, 11, 15, 10)
- (3, 6, 13, 18, 3)
- (3, 0, 9, 2, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (17, 16), 7, (12, 11), 1>
- <5, (9, 2), 7, (12, 9), 5>
- <8, (4, 14), 19, (0, 8), 19>
- <13, (6, 18), 5, (14, 13), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [0] chordless 4-cycles.
