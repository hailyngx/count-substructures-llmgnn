Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 3) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 14) (12, 10) (12, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (6, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 14) (13, 0) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 11) (1, 14) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 7) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 3) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 3) (10, 7) (10, 12) (10, 6) (10, 13) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 2, 8, 5, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 2, 6, 5, 13, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 6, 2, 8, 11, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 5, 8, 3, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 10, 7, 14, 1>
- Cycle 6: <3, 8, 11, 9, 3>
- Cycle 7: <4, 8, 11, 9, 4>
- Cycle 8: <5, 8, 11, 1, 5>
- Cycle 9: <7, 8, 11, 1, 7>
- Cycle 10: <9, 4, 8, 11, 9>
- Cycle 11: <10, 7, 8, 5, 13, 10>
- Cycle 12: <10, 7, 14, 13, 10>
- Cycle 13: <12, 9, 11, 8, 2, 12>
- Cycle 14: <13, 1, 11, 8, 5, 13>
- Cycle 15: <14, 1, 11, 8, 7, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 2, 8, 5, (3, 0)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 6, 10, 7, (14, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, 8, 11, 9, (3, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 8, 11, 9, (4, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 8, 11, 1, (5, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <7, 8, 11, 1, (7, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <9, 4, 8, 11, (9, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <10, 7, 8, 5, (10, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <12, 9, 11, 8, (12, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <13, 1, 11, 8, (13, 1)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found. In this case, there are 10 chordal 4-cycles, so the final answer is [10].
