Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (16, 11) (16, 15) (16, 17) (16, 18) (16, 4) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 1) (4, 16) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (8, 13) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 0) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 18) (10, 1) (10, 19) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 17) (17, 16) (17, 13) (17, 0) (17, 18) (15, 16) (15, 18) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 19) (6, 14) (6, 12) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 2) (1, 12) (2, 1) (19, 10) (19, 14) (12, 6) (12, 1) (12, 3) (18, 16) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 15) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:

<0, 13, 4, 10> 
<0, 13, 4, 16> 
<0, 13, 17, 16> 
<1, 10, 4, 13> 
<1, 10, 4, 16>
<1, 12, 3, 5>
<1, 12, 3, 4>
<1, 12, 6, 14>
<3, 4, 10, 18>
<4, 10, 18, 16>
<7, 11, 16, 15>
<7, 11, 16, 17>
<10, 18, 16, 15>
<10, 18, 16, 17>
<10, 18, 17, 13>
<12, 6, 14, 5>
<13, 0, 7, 11>
<13, 0, 7, 11>
<14, 19, 10, 18>
<15, 16, 11, 7>
<16, 11, 7, 0>
<16, 11, 14, 19>
<16, 15, 18, 10>
<16, 17, 13, 0>
<16, 17, 0, 7>
<17, 13, 0, 7>
<18, 16, 11, 7>
<19, 14, 6, 12>


Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle is: 
<0, (13, 4), 10>; Chord: (13, 4)
<0, (13, 17), 16>; Chord: (13, 17)
<1, (10, 4), 13>; Chord: (10, 4)
<1, (12, 3), 5>; Chord: (12, 3)
<1, (12, 6), 14>; Chord: (12, 6)
<4, (10, 18), 16>; Chord: (10, 18)
<7, (11, 16), 15>; Chord: (11, 16)
<7, (11, 16), 17>; Chord: (11, 16)
<10, (16, 15), 18>; Chord: (16, 15)
<10, (16, 17), 13>; Chord: (16, 17)
<13, (0, 7), 11>; Chord: (0, 7)


Step 3:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [11].
