Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 2) (16, 6) (16, 9) (16, 10) (10, 11) (10, 16) (10, 12) (10, 2) (1, 13) (1, 12) (17, 3) (17, 0) (17, 9) (17, 5) (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 18) (19, 8) (19, 14) (19, 3) (19, 6) (7, 11) (7, 15) (2, 11) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 17) (5, 2) (0, 17) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 18) (3, 17) (3, 19) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 9) (14, 8) (14, 19) (14, 3) (15, 7) (15, 13) (9, 16) (9, 17) (9, 3) (12, 10) (12, 1) (12, 6) (13, 1) (13, 15) (18, 8) (18, 0) (18, 6) (6, 16) (6, 19) (6, 12) (6, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 10 - 11 - 7 - 15 - 13 - 1 - 12 - 10
- Cycle 2: 10 - 2 - 0 - 3 - 17 - 5 - 2
- Cycle 3: 10 - 2 - 11 - 7 - 15 - 13 - 1 - 12 - 10
- Cycle 4: 10 - 12 - 1 - 13 - 15 - 7 - 11 - 10
- Cycle 5: 10 - 16 - 6 - 19 - 8 - 14 - 3 - 17 - 10

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (10, 12)>
- Cycle 2: <2, (0, 3)>
- Cycle 3: <3, (7, 1)>
- Cycle 4: No chord present
- Cycle 5: No chord present

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (10, 12)>
<2, (0, 3)>
<3, (7, 1)>
