Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <5, 9, 6, 5>
- <5, 9, 8, 5>
- <5, 4, 1, 3, 5>
- <5, 4, 2, 8, 5>
- <9, 7, 8, 5, 9>
- <9, 0, 3, 5, 9>
- <9, 0, 4, 1, 3, 9>
- <4, 1, 3, 6, 9, 5, 4>
- <7, 8, 2, 0, 3, 9, 7>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <5, 9, 6, 5> (Chord: (5, 9))
- <5, 9, 8, 5> (Chord: (5, 8))
- <5, 4, 1, 3, 5> (Chord: (4, 1))
- <5, 4, 2, 8, 5> (Chord: (2, 8))
- <9, 7, 8, 5, 9> (Chord: (7, 8))
- <9, 0, 3, 5, 9> (Chord: (3, 0))
- <9, 0, 4, 1, 3, 9> (Chord: (9, 1))
- <4, 1, 3, 6, 9, 5, 4> (No chords)
- <7, 8, 2, 0, 3, 9, 7> (No chords)

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, 9, 6, 5> (Chord: (5, 9))
- <9, 0, 4, 1, 3, 9> (Chord: (9, 1))
