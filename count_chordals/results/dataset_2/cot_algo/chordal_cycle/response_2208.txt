Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-7-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-3-7-5
- Cycle 3: 5-9-1-4-5
- Cycle 4: 5-9-4-0-6-5
- Cycle 5: 5-9-1-0-6-5
- Cycle 6: 5-9-3-7-2-5
- Cycle 7: 5-9-1-0-2-5
- Cycle 8: 4-9-3-7-5-4
- Cycle 9: 7-4-9-1-0-7
- Cycle 10: 7-4-9-3-8-7

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, the cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-7-5  <5, 7> 
- Cycle 2: 5-9-3-7-5  <3, 7>
- Cycle 3: 5-9-1-4-5  <1, 4>
- Cycle 4: 5-9-4-0-6-5  <4, 6>
- Cycle 5: 5-9-1-0-6-5  <1, 6>
- Cycle 6: 5-9-3-7-2-5  <3, 2>
- Cycle 7: 5-9-1-0-2-5  <1, 2>
- Cycle 8: 4-9-3-7-5-4  <3, 5>
- Cycle 9: 7-4-9-1-0-7  <1, 7>
- Cycle 10: 7-4-9-3-8-7  <3, 8>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
