Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 13) (16, 9) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 4) (17, 19) (17, 8) (1, 13) (1, 12) (1, 18) (3, 14) (3, 0) (3, 6) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 5) (7, 11) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 2) (5, 10) (5, 19) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 19) (0, 16) (0, 3) (0, 4) (2, 12) (2, 4) (19, 17) (19, 5) (19, 6) (19, 13) (8, 14) (8, 17) (8, 9) (9, 16) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 15) (4, 14) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 15) (15, 9) (15, 4) (18, 1) (13, 11) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) 

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph are:

<11, 13, 1, 12> with non-adjacent chords (11, 1)
<16, 9, 8, 14> with non-adjacent chords (16, 14)
<10, 12, 2, 4> with non-adjacent chords (10, 2)
<6, 10, 12, 2> with non-adjacent chords (6, 12)
<3, 0, 4, 14> with non-adjacent chords (3, 14)
<19, 13, 11, 7> with non-adjacent chords (19, 11)
<16, 9, 4, 15> with non-adjacent chords (16, 15)
<9, 8, 17, 19> with non-adjacent chords (9, 17)

Counting these unique chordal 4-cycles, we get a total of [8].
