Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 5, 9)
- Cycle 2: (1, 8, 9, 13)
- Cycle 3: (1, 8, 13, 9)
- Cycle 4: (1, 10, 13, 9)
- Cycle 5: (1, 10, 11, 2)
- Cycle 6: (3, 5, 6, 0)
- Cycle 7: (3, 5, 7, 14)
- Cycle 8: (3, 1, 10, 11)
- Cycle 9: (3, 2, 11, 1)
- Cycle 10: (3, 0, 6, 4)
- Cycle 11: (3, 0, 14, 7)
- Cycle 12: (8, 9, 13, 10)
- Cycle 13: (8, 1, 10, 11)
- Cycle 14: (8, 7, 14, 0)
- Cycle 15: (9, 5, 6, 12)
- Cycle 16: (9, 5, 7, 14)
- Cycle 17: (9, 8, 1, 10)
- Cycle 18: (9, 13, 10, 1)
- Cycle 19: (10, 1, 3, 2)

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 8, 9, 13>: Chord (8, 13)
- <1, 10, 13, 9>: Chord (10, 13)
- <1, 10, 11, 2>: Chord (10, 11)
- <3, 5, 7, 14>: Chord (5, 14)
- <3, 0, 6, 4>: Chord (0, 6)
- <8, 9, 13, 10>: Chord (9, 10)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found: [13]
