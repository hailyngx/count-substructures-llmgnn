Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 21) (1, 14) (1, 23) (1, 4) (21, 1) (21, 16) (21, 20) (21, 11) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 29) (7, 3) (7, 10) (18, 22) (18, 2) (18, 6) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 14) (22, 5) (22, 17) (3, 7) (3, 25) (3, 28) (3, 5) (3, 8) (25, 3) (25, 17) (25, 24) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 15) (28, 3) (28, 17) (28, 10) (20, 21) (20, 29) (29, 7) (29, 20) (29, 11) (16, 21) (16, 17) (16, 27) (17, 22) (17, 25) (17, 28) (17, 16) (11, 21) (11, 7) (11, 29) (11, 6) (15, 2) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 24) (19, 15) (19, 10) (19, 6) (5, 22) (5, 3) (5, 12) (8, 3) (14, 1) (14, 22) (0, 15) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 10) (12, 24) (13, 10) (10, 7) (10, 28) (10, 19) (10, 12) (10, 13) (24, 25) (24, 15) (24, 12) (6, 18) (6, 11) (6, 19) (23, 1) (23, 27) (27, 16) (27, 23) (27, 9) (9, 27) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <1, 21, 16, 17>
- <1, 21, 20, 29>
- <1, 4, 7, 29>
- <1, 4, 7, 3>
- <1, 4, 2, 18>
- <1, 14, 22, 17>
- <21, 16, 17, 22>
- <21, 20, 29, 11>
- <21, 11, 7, 4>
- <21, 11, 6, 19>
- <4, 7, 3, 25>
- <4, 2, 18, 22>
- <7, 29, 20, 21>
- <7, 3, 25, 17>
- <18, 22, 17, 25>
- <22, 17, 25, 24>
- <22, 17, 16, 21>
- <3, 7, 4, 2>
- <3, 7, 29, 20>
- <3, 7, 4, 1>

- <2, 4, 7, 3>
- <2, 18, 22, 5>
- <2, 18, 6, 19>
- <28, 17, 22, 5>
- <28, 17, 16, 21>
- <20, 29, 11, 6>
- <29, 20, 21, 16>
- <16, 17, 22, 5>
- <17, 25, 24, 15>
- <17, 25, 3, 7>
- <25, 3, 7, 4>
- <25, 3, 28, 10>
- <25, 24, 12, 10>
- <3, 7, 11, 6>
- <3, 28, 17, 16>
- <11, 7, 4, 2>
- <11, 6, 19, 10>

- <15, 24, 12, 10>
- <19, 6, 18, 22>
- <19, 10, 28, 17>
- <5, 22, 18, 6>
- <5, 3, 7, 4>
- <8, 3, 7, 4>
- <14, 22, 17, 25>
- <0, 15, 24, 25>
- <12, 18, 22, 5>

Step 2:
The only chordal 4-cycle found with exactly one chord is <1, 4, 7, 3>. 

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is therefore [62].
