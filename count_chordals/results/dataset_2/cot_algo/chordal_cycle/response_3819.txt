Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 10) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 14) (12, 9) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 1) (5, 13) (5, 1) (5, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 1) (10, 13) (10, 1) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (1, 12) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 11) (11, 13) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 4) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 8, 7, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 0, 14, 9, 6)
- Cycle 3: (9, 8, 13, 5, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 14, 2, 8, 9)
- Cycle 5: (8, 7, 6, 3, 8)
- Cycle 6: (8, 13, 11, 0, 8)
- Cycle 7: (13, 5, 3, 12, 13)
- Cycle 8: (7, 8, 12, 3, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 6, 3, 12, 7)
- Cycle 10: (12, 9, 14, 0, 12)
- Cycle 11: (12, 8, 2, 1, 12)
- Cycle 12: (5, 13, 10, 1, 5)
- Cycle 13: (0, 6, 7, 8, 0)
- Cycle 14: (0, 14, 2, 1, 0)
- Cycle 15: (0, 11, 4, 3, 0)
- Cycle 16: (14, 9, 8, 7, 14)
- Cycle 17: (14, 7, 3, 5, 14)
- Cycle 18: (2, 9, 6, 0, 2)
- Cycle 19: (2, 8, 13, 11, 2)
- Cycle 20: (2, 14, 0, 11, 2)
- Cycle 21: (2, 1, 10, 13, 2)
- Cycle 22: (10, 13, 11, 4, 10)
- Cycle 23: (3, 6, 0, 14, 3)
- Cycle 24: (3, 7, 8, 12, 3)
- Cycle 25: (3, 12, 1, 2, 3)
- Cycle 26: (3, 5, 13, 10, 3)
- Cycle 27: (3, 4, 11, 0, 3)
- Cycle 28: (1, 12, 8, 7, 1)
- Cycle 29: (1, 5, 3, 4, 1)
- Cycle 30: (1, 2, 14, 0, 1)
- Cycle 31: (1, 10, 13, 5, 1)
- Cycle 32: (1, 11, 4, 0, 1)
- Cycle 33: (11, 13, 5, 3, 11)
- Cycle 34: (11, 0, 6, 9, 11)
- Cycle 35: (11, 1, 2, 8, 11)
- Cycle 36: (11, 4, 0, 14, 11)
- Cycle 37: (4, 0, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 38: (4, 3, 5, 13, 4)
- Cycle 39: (4, 11, 1, 10, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, (3, 5), 2>: Cycle 12 has one chord (3, 5).
- <2, (0, 14), 1>: Cycle 14 has one chord (0, 14).
- <4, (0, 6), 7>: Cycle 37 has one chord (0, 6).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 36 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [36].
