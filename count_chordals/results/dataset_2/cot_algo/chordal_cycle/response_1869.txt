        - Cycle 14: (7, 12, 2, 12, 7)
        - Cycle 15: (7, 12, 16, 12, 7)
        - Cycle 16: (7, 12, 16, 10, 27, 1, 12, 7)
        - Cycle 17: (7, 12, 16, 10, 27, 1, 14, 11, 6, 7)
        - Cycle 18: (7, 19, 18, 3, 21, 20, 23, 5, 3, 7)
        - Cycle 19: (7, 28, 9, 28, 7)

        - Cycle 21: (8, 3, 21, 20, 0, 22, 26, 4, 15, 8)
        - Cycle 22: (10, 17, 14, 11, 6, 11, 18, 19, 7, 12, 16, 10)
        - Cycle 23: (10, 23, 5, 3, 18, 19, 15, 4, 0, 22, 26, 4, 10)
        - Cycle 24: (11, 14, 4, 15, 19, 18, 29, 22, 26, 4, 11)
        - Cycle 25: (11, 14, 4, 0, 20, 21, 3, 5, 23, 10, 27, 1, 12, 7, 19, 11)
        - Cycle 26: (16, 17, 14, 11, 18, 28, 7, 12, 2, 24, 13, 12, 16)
        - Cycle 27: (16, 17, 14, 4, 0, 22, 29, 18, 19, 7, 12, 16)
        - Cycle 28: (16, 17, 10, 23, 5, 3, 21, 20, 0, 4, 14, 11, 6, 11, 18, 28, 7, 12, 16)
        - Cycle 29: (27, 10, 16, 12, 7, 19, 18, 29, 22, 0, 20, 21, 3, 5, 23, 27)
        - Cycle 30: (27, 10, 16, 12, 2, 24, 22, 26, 4, 14, 11, 6, 11, 18, 28, 18, 19, 15, 27)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - <22, (0, 14), 4> Chordal 4-cycle found in Cycle 10
        - <15, (4, 18), 19> Chordal 4-cycle found in Cycle 24

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 28 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
