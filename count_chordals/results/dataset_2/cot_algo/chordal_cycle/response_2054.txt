Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 2, 7, 4, 9) with edges (5, 2), (2, 7), (7, 4), (4, 9), (9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 2, 0, 1, 4) with edges (5, 2), (2, 0), (0, 1), (1, 4), (4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 2, 7, 0, 1) with edges (5, 2), (2, 7), (7, 0), (0, 1), (1, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 8, 1, 0, 9) with edges (5, 8), (8, 1), (1, 0), (0, 9), (9, 5)
- Cycle 5: (4, 7, 2, 3, 9) with edges (4, 7), (7, 2), (2, 3), (3, 9), (9, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 1, 0, 7, 2) with edges (4, 1), (1, 0), (0, 7), (7, 2), (2, 4)
- Cycle 7: (7, 0, 6, 2, 5) with edges (7, 0), (0, 6), (6, 2), (2, 5), (5, 7)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (5, 2, 7, 4, 9) has exactly one chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 4: (5, 8, 1, 0, 9) has exactly one chord (5, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, (5, 9), 2, 7, 4>
<5, (5, 9), 8, 1, 0>
