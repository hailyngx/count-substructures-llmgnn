Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 13) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 6) (0, 8) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 9) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 10) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 14) (9, 2) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 10) (10, 7) (10, 0) (10, 5) (10, 2) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 13) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 12) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: 1-4-12-13 (Length 4)
- Cycle 2: 1-4-6-3-5-8-9-14-11 (Length 8)
- Cycle 3: 2-1-4-6-13-12-8-5-3-11-14-7-10 (Length 12)
- Cycle 4: 0-8-9-14-7-4-6-13-12-4-1-3-6-11-14-3-5-8 (Length 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (4, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- The number of chordless 4-cycles in the given graph is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, 4, 12, 13>
