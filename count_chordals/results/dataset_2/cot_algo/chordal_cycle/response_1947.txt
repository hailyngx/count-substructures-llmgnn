Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 26) (9, 13) (9, 12) (26, 9) (26, 5) (26, 20) (26, 25) (1, 21) (1, 15) (1, 5) (1, 28) (1, 0) (21, 1) (21, 27) (21, 25) (3, 25) (3, 23) (25, 26) (25, 21) (25, 3) (25, 16) (10, 11) (10, 17) (10, 7) (10, 23) (11, 10) (11, 18) (17, 10) (17, 2) (17, 7) (15, 1) (15, 20) (15, 22) (15, 14) (15, 12) (20, 26) (20, 15) (20, 8) (4, 6) (18, 11) (18, 23) (18, 29) (7, 10) (7, 17) (12, 9) (12, 15) (12, 16) (12, 8) (5, 26) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (23, 3) (23, 10) (23, 18) (2, 17) (2, 22) (2, 19) (22, 15) (22, 2) (22, 28) (22, 29) (16, 25) (16, 12) (16, 27) (14, 15) (14, 8) (14, 28) (14, 19) (0, 1) (0, 8) (28, 1) (28, 22) (28, 14) (8, 20) (8, 12) (8, 14) (8, 0) (19, 2) (19, 14) (19, 29) (19, 27) (27, 21) (27, 16) (27, 19) (29, 18) (29, 22) (29, 19) (13, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 9-26-5-1-9
        - Cycle 2: 9-12-15-1-9
        - Cycle 3: 9-12-8-20-26-9
        - Cycle 4: 9-12-8-0-1-9
        - Cycle 5: 26-25-3-23-10-26
        - Cycle 6: 26-25-3-23-18-11-10-26
        - Cycle 7: 26-25-21-1-9-26
        - Cycle 8: 26-25-21-27-16-25
        - Cycle 9: 26-25-3-23-18-29-22-28-14-19-27-16-25
        - Cycle 10: 1-9-12-15-22-2-17-7-10-23-18-29-19-14-8-0-1
        - Cycle 11: 15-14-19-29-22-2-17-10-7-17-2-22-15
        ...
        (additional cycles can be listed)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has chord: (5, 1)
        - Cycle 2 has chord: (15, 12)
        - Cycle 4 has chord: (12, 1)
        - Cycle 5 has chord: (25, 23)
        - Cycle 7 has chord: (21, 9)
        - Cycle 9 has chord: (25, 21)
        - Cycle 10 has chord: (12, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There is only 1 chordless cycle:
        - <9, 26, 25, 3>

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
