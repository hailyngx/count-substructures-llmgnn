Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-9-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-3-6-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-9-4-0
- Cycle 4: 0-2-7-6-0
- Cycle 5: 0-6-7-3-0
- Cycle 6: 0-8-6-1-0
- Cycle 7: 0-8-5-2-0
- Cycle 8: 1-6-7-9-1
- Cycle 9: 1-6-3-5-1
- Cycle 10: 2-5-8-6-2
- Cycle 11: 2-9-4-3-2
- Cycle 12: 3-4-9-7-3
- Cycle 13: 3-5-1-6-3
- Cycle 14: 3-7-9-4-3
- Cycle 15: 4-0-8-6-4
- Cycle 16: 5-1-6-8-5
- Cycle 17: 5-2-9-7-5
- Cycle 18: 5-3-7-6-5
- Cycle 19: 5-8-0-4-5
- Cycle 20: 6-0-4-9-6
- Cycle 21: 6-1-5-3-6
- Cycle 22: 6-3-4-0-6
- Cycle 23: 6-7-9-1-6
- Cycle 24: 7-3-4-9-7
- Cycle 25: 7-6-8-0-7
- Cycle 26: 7-9-2-5-7
- Cycle 27: 8-0-2-9-8
- Cycle 28: 8-5-1-6-8
- Cycle 29: 8-6-7-9-8
- Cycle 30: 9-1-5-2-9
- Cycle 31: 9-2-0-4-9
- Cycle 32: 9-4-3-7-9

Step 2:
Upon checking each of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, (4, 9), 2, 0>
- <0, (4, 3), 6, 0>
- <0, (2, 9), 4, 0>
- <0, (2, 7), 6, 0>
- <0, (6, 7), 3, 0>
- <0, (6, 1), 8, 0>
- <0, (5, 2), 8, 0>
- <1, (6, 7), 9, 1>
- <1, (6, 3), 5, 1>
- <2, (5, 8), 6, 2>
- <2, (9, 4), 3, 2>
- <3, (4, 9), 7, 3>
- <3, (5, 1), 6, 3>
- <3, (4, 7), 9, 3>
- <4, (0, 8), 6, 4>
- <5, (1, 6), 8, 5>
- <5, (2, 9), 7, 5>
- <5, (3, 7), 6, 5>
- <5, (0, 4), 8, 5>
- <6, (0, 4), 9, 6>
- <6, (1, 5), 3, 6>
- <6, (3, 4), 0, 6>
- <6, (7, 9), 1, 6>
- <7, (3, 4), 9, 7>
- <7, (6, 8), 0, 7>
- <7, (9, 2), 5, 7>
- <8, (0, 2), 9, 8>
- <8, (5, 1), 6, 8>
- <8, (6, 7), 9, 8>
- <9, (1, 5), 2, 9>
- <9, (2, 0), 4, 9>
- <9, (4, 3), 7, 9>

Step 3:
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles is therefore counted as [32].
