Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 2) (3, 5) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 26) (15, 25) (18, 22) (18, 4) (18, 12) (22, 18) (22, 28) (22, 24) (22, 1) (8, 10) (8, 7) (0, 20) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 29) (20, 0) (20, 17) (20, 7) (20, 23) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 19) (5, 14) (6, 5) (6, 29) (4, 18) (17, 20) (17, 29) (17, 25) (17, 24) (29, 0) (29, 6) (29, 17) (26, 15) (26, 14) (26, 21) (11, 3) (11, 28) (11, 25) (28, 22) (28, 11) (28, 9) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 20) (23, 20) (23, 2) (10, 8) (10, 21) (10, 2) (10, 9) (21, 26) (21, 10) (21, 12) (21, 14) (14, 5) (14, 26) (14, 21) (14, 1) (25, 15) (25, 17) (25, 11) (24, 22) (24, 17) (24, 2) (12, 18) (12, 21) (12, 16) (16, 3) (16, 12) (9, 0) (9, 28) (9, 19) (9, 10) (1, 22) (1, 14) (2, 3) (2, 23) (2, 10) (2, 24) 

Response:
The chordal 4-cycle in this graph is as follows:
<3, (5, 15), 19>

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 3-15-19-5-3
- Cycle 2: 3-15-26-21-3
- Cycle 3: 3-15-25-17-3
- Cycle 4: 3-15-25-11-3
- Cycle 5: 3-16-12-18-3
- Cycle 6: 3-16-12-21-3
- Cycle 7: 3-16-12-21-26-3
- Cycle 8: 3-2-24-17-3
- Cycle 9: 3-2-24-22-3
- Cycle 10: 3-2-24-17-25-3
- Cycle 11: 3-2-24-22-28-3

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Only Cycle 1: 3-15-19-5-3 has exactly one chord (5, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There is only one chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, so the final count is [1].
