Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 13) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 9) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 18) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 1) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 12) (2, 3) (19, 1) (19, 3) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 18) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 3) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 3) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 13) (3, 18) 

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 11-16-7-1-11
- Cycle 2: 5-9-7-1-5
- Cycle 3: 6-5-9-7-6
- Cycle 4: 10-13-3-19-10
- Cycle 5: 17-6-14-12-17
- Cycle 6: 15-10-13-3-15
- Cycle 7: 0-18-3-13-0
- Cycle 8: 12-14-18-0-12

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (16, 7)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (9, 1)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (13, 3)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (6, 14)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (10, 13)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (18, 3)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (14, 0)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<11, (16, 7), 1>
<5, (9, 1), 7>
<6, (9, 7), 5>
<10, (13, 3), 15>
<17, (6, 14), 12>
<0, (18, 3), 12>
<12, (14, 0), 18>
<15, (10, 13), 3>
