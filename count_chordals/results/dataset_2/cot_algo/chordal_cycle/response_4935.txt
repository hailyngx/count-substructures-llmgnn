Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-7-3-1 (chords: 4-7)
- Cycle 2: 1-4-2-6-1 (chords: 2-6)
- Cycle 3: 1-4-2-5-1 (chords: 2-5)
- Cycle 4: 2-4-7-3-2 (chords: 4-7)
- Cycle 5: 2-4-1-6-2 (chords: 1-6)
- Cycle 6: 2-4-1-3-2 (chords: 1-3)
- Cycle 7: 2-5-9-6-2 (chords: 5-9)
- Cycle 8: 3-1-6-9-3 (chords: 1-9)
- Cycle 9: 3-1-4-7-3 (chords: 1-7)
- Cycle 10: 3-1-4-2-3 (chords: 1-2)
- Cycle 11: 3-7-4-1-3 (chords: 4-1)
- Cycle 12: 3-7-4-2-3 (chords: 4-2)
- Cycle 13: 3-7-8-5-3 (chords: 8-5)
- Cycle 14: 6-2-4-7-6 (chords: 2-7)
- Cycle 15: 6-2-4-1-6 (chords: 1-4)
- Cycle 16: 6-9-5-2-6 (chords: 5-9)
- Cycle 17: 6-9-5-3-6 (chords: 5-3)
- Cycle 18: 7-3-1-4-7 (chords: 1-4)
- Cycle 19: 7-3-1-6-7 (chords: 1-6)
- Cycle 20: 7-3-1-4-7 (chords: 1-4)
- Cycle 21: 7-8-5-2-7 (chords: 5-8)
- Cycle 22: 7-8-5-3-7 (chords: 5-3)
- Cycle 23: 8-3-1-4-8 (chords: 1-4)
- Cycle 24: 8-3-1-6-8 (chords: 1-6)
- Cycle 25: 8-3-7-4-8 (chords: 7-4)
- Cycle 26: 8-5-9-6-8 (chords: 5-9)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2: 1-4-2-6-1 (chords: 2-6) <1, (2, 6)>
- Cycle 7: 2-5-9-6-2 (chords: 5-9) <2, (5, 9)>
- Cycle 8: 3-1-6-9-3 (chords: 1-9) <3, (1, 9)>
- Cycle 13: 3-7-8-5-3 (chords: 8-5) <4, (5, 8)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 26 cycles in total. From Step 2, we found 4 chordal 4-cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [26-4 = 22].
