Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (0, 6), 27>
- <5, (11, 25), 22>
- <5, (11, 25), 18>
- <17, (0, 6), 1>
- <28, (9, 21), 13>
- <1, (0, 6), 23>
- <3, (5, 11), 25>
- <3, (13, 21), 0>
- <20, (9, 28), 21>
- <25, (11, 8), 20>
- <25, (22, 26), 10>
- <18, (8, 29), 25>
- <21, (13, 3), 5>
- <25, (20, 14), 8>
- <21, (28, 9), 20>
- <17, (0, 6), 5>
- <17, (2, 24), 18>
- <29, (1, 0), 27>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 33 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [33].
