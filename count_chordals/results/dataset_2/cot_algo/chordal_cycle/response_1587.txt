Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <1, 6, 9, 7>
2. <1, 4, 8, 6>
3. <1, 5, 7, 0>
4. <1, 6, 3, 7>
5. <3, 4, 8, 9>
6. <3, 7, 0, 5>
7. <4, 8, 9, 2>
8. <4, 1, 5, 7>
9. <7, 0, 3, 6>
10. <6, 8, 4, 5>

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles:

Chordal 4-cycle <1, 6, 9, 7> has the single chord (1, 9).
Chordal 4-cycle <1, 4, 8, 6> has the single chord (4, 8).
Chordal 4-cycle <1, 5, 7, 0> has the single chord (5, 7).
Chordal 4-cycle <1, 6, 3, 7> has the single chord (6, 3).
Chordal 4-cycle <3, 4, 8, 9> has the single chord (4, 8).
Chordal 4-cycle <3, 7, 0, 5> has the single chord (7, 0).
Chordal 4-cycle <4, 8, 9, 2> has the single chord (8, 9).
Chordal 4-cycle <4, 1, 5, 7> has the single chord (1, 5).
Chordal 4-cycle <7, 0, 3, 6> has the single chord (0, 3).
Chordal 4-cycle <6, 8, 4, 5> has the single chord (8, 4).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles identified, so the final count is [10].
