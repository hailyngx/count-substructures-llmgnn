Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 9, 7, 4, 5)
- (5, 4, 2, 8, 5)
- (9, 7, 4, 2, 9)
- (4, 6, 1, 7, 4)
- (7, 3, 8, 2, 7)
- (6, 0, 8, 5, 6)
- (2, 8, 3, 4, 2)
- (8, 0, 1, 6, 8)
- (1, 7, 3, 6, 1)
- (3, 9, 5, 8, 3)
- (0, 6, 4, 7, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, (9, 7), 4, 5>
- <5, (2, 8), 4, 5>
- <9, (7, 2), 4, 9>
- <4, (6, 1), 7, 4>
- <7, (3, 8), 4, 7>
- <6, (0, 8), 5, 6>
- <2, (8, 3), 4, 2>
- <8, (0, 1), 6, 8>
- <1, (7, 3), 6, 1>
- <3, (9, 5), 8, 3>
- <0, (6, 4), 7, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
