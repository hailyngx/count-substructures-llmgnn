Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
        - Cycle 1: 0-1-2-3-0
        - Cycle 2: 1-2-3-7-1
        - Cycle 3: 7-2-1-8-7
        - Cycle 4: 8-1-0-3-8
        - Cycle 5: 5-8-7-4-5
        - Cycle 6: 9-5-8-6-9
        - Cycle 7: 6-8-1-4-6
        - Cycle 8: 4-1-0-5-4
        - Cycle 9: 0-4-7-3-0
        - Cycle 10: 3-7-2-1-3

Step 2: Checking each cycle for a chord:
        - Cycle 1 has no chords.
        - Cycle 2 has no chords.
        - Cycle 3 has no chords.
        - Cycle 4 has no chords.
        - Cycle 5 has no chords.
        - Cycle 6 has the chord (5, 9).
        - Cycle 7 has the chord (1, 4).
        - Cycle 8 has no chords.
        - Cycle 9 has no chords.
        - Cycle 10 has no chords.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 7 chordless cycles among the 10 cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].

The unique chordless 4-cycle found is <0, 3, 7, 4>.
