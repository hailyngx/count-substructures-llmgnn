Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 19) (8, 14) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 18) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 19) (11, 0) (11, 2) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (12, 10) (12, 7) (12, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 17) (5, 0) (17, 5) (17, 3) (17, 4) (19, 8) (19, 11) (19, 18) (19, 15) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 16) (0, 15) (0, 2) (16, 0) (18, 13) (18, 19) (18, 6) (15, 19) (15, 0) (15, 4) (3, 7) (3, 17) (3, 4) (6, 18) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 0) (14, 8) (14, 10) (9, 12) (9, 1) (1, 10) (1, 5) (1, 9) (4, 17) (4, 15) (4, 3) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-11-19-15-0
- Cycle 2: 0-11-2-5-0
- Cycle 3: 0-16-0-11-2-5-0
- Cycle 4: 2-11-0-16-0-11-2
- Cycle 5: 2-11-19-18-13-5-2
- Cycle 6: 2-5-0-16-0-11-2
- Cycle 7: 3-7-12-9-1-5-3
- Cycle 8: 3-4-15-19-11-2-3
- Cycle 9: 3-4-17-5-13-18-3
- Cycle 10: 3-17-5-13-18-6-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (0, 5).
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (0, 11).
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (11, 5).
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (11, 2).
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (12, 5).
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (19, 15).
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (5, 18).
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (13, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<2, (0, 5), 11, 19>
<3, (12, 5), 7, 17>
<4, (17, 5), 13, 18>
<5, (5, 18), 4, 3>
<6, (11, 2), 0, 16>
<7, (15, 19), 4, 3>
