Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 15) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 17) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 15) (1, 18) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (10, 9) (10, 11) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (7, 1) (7, 12) (7, 8) (12, 5) (12, 7) (4, 5) (4, 17) (18, 1) (18, 15) (18, 8) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 16) (2, 0) (2, 19) (15, 5) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 13) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 18) (8, 14) (16, 0) (16, 17) (16, 13) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 13) (17, 9) (17, 4) (17, 16) (19, 2) (13, 15) (13, 16) (13, 14) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
<0, 11, 14, 13>
<0, 16, 17, 4>
<1, 3, 6, 8>
<1, 3, 11, 14>
<1, 7, 12, 5>
<1, 15, 18, 8>
<3, 6, 9, 10>
<11, 14, 13, 15>
<13, 14, 11, 0>
<13, 15, 18, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
<0, 11, 14, 13> has one chord: (11, 13)
<0, 16, 17, 4> has one chord: (16, 17)
<1, 3, 6, 8> has one chord: (3, 8)
<1, 3, 11, 14> has one chord: (3, 14)
<1, 7, 12, 5> has one chord: (7, 12)
<1, 15, 18, 8> has one chord: (15, 8)
<3, 6, 9, 10> has one chord: (6, 9)
<11, 14, 13, 15> has one chord: (14, 15)
<13, 14, 11, 0> has one chord: (14, 0)
<13, 15, 18, 8> has one chord: (15, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
