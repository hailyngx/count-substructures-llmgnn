Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 27) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 5) (17, 7) (22, 2) (22, 27) (22, 16) (22, 20) (23, 10) (23, 9) (4, 20) (4, 26) (8, 28) (1, 26) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 27) (26, 4) (26, 1) (26, 11) (21, 19) (28, 8) (28, 12) (28, 18) (28, 5) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 25) (5, 17) (5, 28) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (9, 23) (9, 27) (9, 19) (10, 23) (10, 3) (12, 28) (12, 24) (12, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 15) (6, 20) (6, 0) (2, 22) (2, 1) (2, 16) (11, 26) (11, 29) (25, 13) (25, 18) (0, 6) (27, 14) (27, 22) (27, 1) (27, 9) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 6) (24, 12) (24, 7) (24, 29) (7, 17) (7, 24) (7, 18) (18, 28) (18, 5) (18, 25) (18, 7) (18, 16) (19, 21) (19, 9) (19, 20) (16, 22) (16, 5) (16, 2) (16, 18) (15, 6) (15, 29) (20, 22) (20, 4) (20, 6) (20, 19) (29, 11) (29, 24) (29, 15) 

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-26-4-20-6-1
- Cycle 2: 1-27-14-17-5-1
- Cycle 3: 1-27-22-16-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-3-12-28-8-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-3-10-23-9-1
- Cycle 6: 1-6-3-12-24-7-1
- Cycle 7: 1-6-20-22-16-2-1
- Cycle 8: 1-27-14-13-25-18-1
- Cycle 9: 2-1-6-20-22-16-2
- Cycle 10: 4-26-1-27-22-16-4
- Cycle 11: 5-17-14-13-25-18-5
- Cycle 12: 5-17-7-24-12-3-5
- Cycle 13: 5-18-25-13-14-17-5
- Cycle 14: 5-18-25-13-14-27-5
- Cycle 15: 5-28-12-3-6-20-5
- Cycle 16: 16-22-20-6-1-27-16
- Cycle 17: 18-28-12-3-6-1-18

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (26, 4), 20, 6>
- <1, (27, 14), 17, 5>
- <1, (27, 22), 16, 2>
- <1, (6, 3), 12, 28>
- <1, (6, 3), 10, 23>
- <1, (6, 20), 22, 16>
- <1, (27, 14), 13, 25>
- <2, (1, 6), 20, 22>
- <4, (26, 1), 27, 16>
- <5, (17, 14), 13, 25>
- <5, (17, 7), 24, 12>
- <5, (18, 25), 13, 14>
- <5, (18, 25), 13, 27>
- <5, (28, 12), 3, 6>
- <16, (22, 20), 6, 1>
- <18, (28, 12), 3, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [14].
