Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 6) (13, 8) (13, 10) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 11) (7, 3) (7, 12) (7, 6) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 0) (0, 8) (0, 12) (0, 5) (0, 9) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 10) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 10) (11, 8) (11, 4) (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 6) (10, 13) (10, 7) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 9) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 11) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 10) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (0, 8, 11, 5, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 8, 4, 3, 5, 11, 0)
- Cycle 3: (2, 7, 3, 5, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 7, 6, 11, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 7, 12, 0, 8, 4, 5, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 10, 13, 8, 4, 11, 14, 10)
- Cycle 7: (3, 4, 8, 0, 9, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 4, 8, 6, 7, 3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 5, 4, 8, 11, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 10: (3, 5, 4, 8, 13, 10, 2, 7, 6, 11, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 5, 2, 7, 12, 0, 9, 10, 13, 8, 4, 11, 5)
- Cycle 12: (4, 3, 7, 2, 5, 11, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: (0, 8, 11, 5, 0) <Chord (8, 5)>
- Cycle 2: (0, 8, 4, 3, 5, 11, 0) <Chord (3, 11)>
- Cycle 3: (2, 7, 3, 5, 2) <Chord (7, 5)>
- Cycle 4: (2, 7, 6, 11, 2) <Chord (7, 11)>
- Cycle 5: (2, 7, 12, 0, 8, 4, 5, 2) <Chord (8, 12)>
- Cycle 6: (2, 10, 13, 8, 4, 11, 14, 10) <Chord (10, 11)>
- Cycle 7: (3, 4, 8, 0, 9, 3) <Chord (4, 9)>
- Cycle 8: (3, 4, 8, 6, 7, 3) <Chord (4, 7)>
- Cycle 9: (3, 5, 4, 8, 11, 6, 7, 5) <Chord (5, 11)>
- Cycle 10: (3, 5, 4, 8, 13, 10, 2, 7, 6, 11, 3) <Chord (5, 13)>
- Cycle 11: (3, 5, 2, 7, 12, 0, 9, 10, 13, 8, 4, 11, 5) <Chord (5, 10)>
- Cycle 12: (4, 3, 7, 2, 5, 11, 4) <Chord (3, 7)>


Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [12].
