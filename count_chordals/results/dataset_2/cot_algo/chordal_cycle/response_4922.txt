Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 7 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 6 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 6 - 8 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 4: 9 - 7 - 3 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 5: 4 - 6 - 8 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 6: 8 - 6 - 4 - 3 - 8
- Cycle 7: 8 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 8
- Cycle 8: 3 - 7 - 9 - 1 - 3
- Cycle 9: 7 - 8 - 6 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 10: 6 - 5 - 2 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 11: 5 - 1 - 7 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 12: 9 - 5 - 4 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 13: 4 - 8 - 2 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 14: 7 - 3 - 0 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 15: 8 - 1 - 2 - 6 - 8

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2: <5, (4, 2), 6>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <5, (4, 2), 6>
