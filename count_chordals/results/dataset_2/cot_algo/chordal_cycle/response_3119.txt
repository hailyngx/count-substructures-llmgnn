- Cycle 24: (6, 1), (1, 4), (4, 5), (5, 7), (7, 29), (29, 18), (18, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: Chord (6, 17)
- Cycle 3: Chord (6, 11)
- Cycle 4: Chord (6, 22)
- Cycle 9: Chord (6, 20)
- Cycle 10: Chord (6, 18)
- Cycle 14: Chord (6, 7)
- Cycle 15: Chord (6, 29)
- Cycle 16: Chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 18: Chord (6, 17)
- Cycle 19: Chord (6, 28)
- Cycle 21: Chord (6, 24)
- Cycle 22: Chord (6, 20)
- Cycle 24: Chord (6, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
