Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 12) (14, 23) (14, 16) (17, 14) (17, 29) (17, 6) (0, 27) (0, 11) (0, 29) (0, 23) (27, 0) (27, 18) (27, 7) (27, 6) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (11, 0) (11, 10) (11, 22) (11, 13) (11, 8) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 19) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 4) (8, 19) (8, 25) (7, 27) (7, 18) (12, 14) (12, 9) (29, 17) (29, 0) (29, 6) (29, 25) (29, 24) (19, 4) (19, 8) (19, 26) (19, 22) (19, 1) (26, 19) (26, 13) (26, 24) (26, 21) (21, 26) (21, 28) (21, 2) (28, 21) (28, 2) (13, 11) (13, 26) (13, 3) (24, 29) (24, 26) (1, 19) (1, 15) (1, 18) (15, 1) (2, 21) (2, 28) (22, 11) (22, 19) (22, 20) (6, 17) (6, 27) (6, 29) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 5) (16, 14) (16, 5) (5, 3) (5, 16) (23, 14) (23, 0) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 20) (25, 8) (25, 29) (18, 27) (18, 7) (18, 1) (20, 22) (20, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<Cycles>
- <0, 29, 17, 14, 0>
- <0, 27, 6, 17, 29, 0>
- <0, 23, 14, 12, 9, 4, 8, 11, 0>
- <0, 11, 8, 4, 9, 12, 14, 16, 5, 3, 10, 11>
- <0, 23, 14, 16, 5, 3, 13, 26, 1, 15, 1, 18, 27, 6, 29, 25, 8, 11, 10, 3, 5, 16, 14, 17, 29>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        
<Chordal 4-cycle>
- <0, 23, 14, (16, 5), 3, 13, 26, 1, 15, 1, 18, 27, 6, 29, 25, 8, 11>
- <0, 11, (8, 4), 9, 12, 14, 16, 5, 3, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
