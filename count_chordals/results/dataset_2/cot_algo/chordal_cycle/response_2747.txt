Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 4) (9, 14) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 5) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 4) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 1) (13, 14) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 3) (1, 12) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 14) (0, 10) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 2) (14, 10) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 2) (12, 1) (12, 11) (10, 0) (10, 14) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 2) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
Here are the cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 4-6-3-1-4
- Cycle 2: 4-6-3-0-4
- Cycle 3: 4-7-3-0-4
- Cycle 4: 4-7-3-1-4
- Cycle 5: 4-7-14-0-4
- Cycle 6: 4-7-14-2-4
- Cycle 7: 4-13-14-0-4
- Cycle 8: 4-13-14-2-4
- Cycle 9: 4-2-11-5-4
- Cycle 10: 7-3-0-14-7
- Cycle 11: 7-14-0-10-7
- Cycle 12: 7-14-2-11-7
- Cycle 13: 13-14-0-10-13
- Cycle 14: 13-14-2-11-13
- Cycle 15: 5-11-2-14-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
Based on the cycles listed above, the following cycles have exactly one chord:
- Cycle <1, (13, 7), 4>
- Cycle <3, (0, 7), 4>
- Cycle <7, (14, 2), 4>
- Cycle <13, (0, 14), 4>
- Cycle <11, (2, 5), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
