Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 14) (8, 0) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 2) (12, 4) (12, 0) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 6) (1, 12) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 5) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 10) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 1) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 12) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle <6, 9, 13, 4>
- Cycle <6, 9, 3, 2>
- Cycle <9, 13, 4, 12>
- Cycle <9, 13, 3, 2>
- Cycle <4, 12, 0, 8>
- Cycle <4, 12, 1, 6>
- Cycle <4, 13, 3, 2>
- Cycle <7, 14, 9, 13>
- Cycle <7, 14, 1, 6>
- Cycle <8, 0, 12, 4>
- Cycle <8, 0, 3, 2>
- Cycle <8, 5, 1, 6>
- Cycle <3, 10, 7, 14>
- Cycle <3, 11, 14, 1>
- Cycle <11, 14, 1, 6>
- Cycle <12, 1, 6, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

From the cycles listed above, we find one chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, 9, 13, 4> with chord (2, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There is 0 chordless cycle in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [1].
