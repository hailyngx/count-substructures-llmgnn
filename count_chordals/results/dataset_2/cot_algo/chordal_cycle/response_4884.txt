Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 2, 1, 5)
- (5, 4, 7, 5)
- (5, 3, 1, 5)
- (5, 7, 4, 5)
- (5, 1, 3, 5)
- (5, 2, 9, 6)
- (5, 2, 1, 3, 5)
- (5, 1, 3, 0, 5)
- (5, 3, 0, 4, 5)
- (5, 4, 0, 3, 5)
- (5, 4, 6, 9, 5)
- (5, 7, 4, 0, 5)
- (5, 7, 8, 9, 5)
- (5, 2, 9, 8, 5)

Cycles of length 5:
- (5, 2, 1, 3, 0, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (edges connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, (2, 1), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final answer is [1].
