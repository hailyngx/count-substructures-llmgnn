Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 11) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 13) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 11) (14, 12) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 6) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 11) (12, 14) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 4) (10, 9) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more with all necessary edges:
- Cycle: (1, 3, 6, 5, 1)
- Cycle: (2, 6, 7, 13, 2)
- Cycle: (4, 0, 9, 2, 4)
- Cycle: (7, 0, 8, 13, 7)
- Cycle: (9, 0, 8, 14, 9)
- Cycle: (11, 4, 0, 7, 11)
- Cycle: (13, 1, 5, 13)
- Cycle: (14, 8, 0, 4, 14)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, 3, (6, 5), 1>
- <2, 6, (7, 13), 2>
- <4, 0, (9, 2), 4>
- <7, 0, (8, 13), 7>
- <9, 0, (8, 14), 9>
- <11, 4, (0, 7), 11>
- <13, 1, (5, 13), 13>
- <14, 8, (0, 4), 14>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we get [8].
