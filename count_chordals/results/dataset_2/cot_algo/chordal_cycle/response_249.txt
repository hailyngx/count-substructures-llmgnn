Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 23) (5, 8) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 27) (0, 10) (27, 9) (27, 29) (27, 17) (27, 13) (20, 22) (17, 27) (17, 29) (17, 18) (29, 27) (29, 17) (29, 7) (29, 4) (18, 17) (18, 26) (18, 19) (18, 6) (18, 25) (26, 18) (26, 15) (26, 11) (26, 16) (8, 5) (1, 24) (15, 26) (15, 21) (15, 28) (19, 18) (19, 2) (25, 18) (25, 4) (25, 28) (25, 14) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 22) (10, 14) (3, 24) (3, 22) (28, 15) (28, 25) (28, 7) (11, 26) (11, 24) (11, 21) (24, 1) (24, 3) (24, 11) (24, 7) (24, 13) (7, 29) (7, 28) (7, 24) (23, 5) (23, 4) (23, 14) (23, 21) (2, 19) (2, 16) (4, 29) (4, 25) (4, 23) (4, 16) (12, 10) (12, 13) (13, 27) (13, 24) (13, 12) (6, 18) (6, 16) (14, 25) (14, 10) (14, 23) (16, 26) (16, 2) (16, 4) (16, 6) (22, 20) (22, 10) (22, 3) (21, 15) (21, 11) (21, 23) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
        - Cycle 1: (5, 9, 27, 17, 18, 26, 15, 21, 11, 24, 3, 22, 10, 5)
        - Cycle 2: (5, 9, 27, 17, 18, 26, 16, 2, 19, 18, 17, 27, 9, 29, 7, 28, 25, 18, 6, 16, 26, 15, 28, 25, 4, 29, 17, 18, 6)
        - Cycle 3: (5, 9, 27, 17, 18, 19, 2, 16, 4, 25, 18, 17, 27, 29, 4, 23, 21, 15, 26, 18, 6, 16, 26, 11, 24, 1, 24, 13, 27, 29, 17, 18, 26, 15, 28, 7, 24, 11, 21, 23, 4, 25, 14, 10, 22, 20, 22, 3)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 8, 10, 0, 12, 13, 27, 17, 29, 7, 24, 11, 26, 16, 6, 18, 19, 2, 16, 26, 15, 21, 23, 4, 25, 28, 7, 29, 17, 18, 6)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 8, 10, 22, 20, 22, 3, 24, 13, 27, 17, 18, 6, 16, 2, 19, 18, 17, 29, 4, 23, 14, 25, 4, 16, 26, 11, 21, 23, 14, 10, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, (5, 9)> - Chord: (5, 9)
        - <2, (17, 29)> - Chord: (17, 29)
        - <3, (17, 27)> - Chord: (17, 27)
        - <4, (5, 8)> - Chord: (5, 8)
        - <5, (10, 22)> - Chord: (10, 22)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles identified, so the final count is [5].
