Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 11) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (5, 6) (5, 11) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 10) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 11) (8, 1) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 10) (12, 2) (12, 8) (12, 13) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 5) (11, 2) (10, 3) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 8) (10, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: 2-3-9-6-2
- Cycle 2: 0-2-3-9-0
- Cycle 3: 1-11-7-6-1
- Cycle 4: 11-5-6-7-11
- Cycle 5: 14-8-12-13-14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- For Cycle 1, there is no chord.
- For Cycle 2, there is no chord.
- For Cycle 3, the chords are (1,7).
- For Cycle 4, there is no chord.
- For Cycle 5, there is no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 4 chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final count of unique chordal 4-cycles is [4]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <2, 3, 9, 6, (2, 9)>
- <0, 2, 3, 9, (0, 3)>
- <11, 5, 6, 7, (11, 6)>
- <14, 8, 12, 13, (14, 12)>
