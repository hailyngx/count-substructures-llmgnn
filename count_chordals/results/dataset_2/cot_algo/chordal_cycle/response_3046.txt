Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-8-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-8-5-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-8-3-0
- Cycle 4: 0-5-8-4-0
- Cycle 5: 6-7-9-3-6
- Cycle 6: 6-7-9-8-6
- Cycle 7: 6-9-8-3-6
- Cycle 8: 6-9-8-7-6
- Cycle 9: 2-7-5-0-2
- Cycle 10: 2-7-5-8-2
- Cycle 11: 2-5-8-3-2
- Cycle 12: 2-5-8-7-2
- Cycle 13: 2-5-3-6-2
- Cycle 14: 2-5-3-9-2
- Cycle 15: 5-8-3-6-5
- Cycle 16: 5-8-3-0-5
- Cycle 17: 5-3-9-6-5
- Cycle 18: 5-3-9-7-5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, (4, 8), 3, 6>
- <0, (4, 8), 5, 3>
- <0, (5, 8), 3, 6>
- <0, (5, 8), 4, 3>
- <6, (7, 9), 3, 8>
- <6, (7, 9), 8, 6>
- <6, (9, 8), 3, 7>
- <6, (9, 8), 7, 6>
- <2, (5, 7), 0, 2>
- <2, (5, 7), 8, 2>
- <2, (5, 8), 3, 2>
- <2, (5, 8), 7, 2>
- <2, (5, 3), 6, 2>
- <2, (5, 3), 9, 2>
- <5, (8, 3), 6, 5>
- <5, (8, 3), 0, 5>
- <5, (3, 9), 6, 5>
- <5, (3, 9), 7, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [18].
