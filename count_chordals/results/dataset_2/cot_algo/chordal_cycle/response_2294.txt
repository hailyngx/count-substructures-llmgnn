Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 10) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 8) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (0, 10) (0, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 14) (6, 1) (14, 4) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- Cycle 1: 1-7-4-8-1
- Cycle 2: 1-7-4-13-1
- Cycle 3: 3-1-7-4-3
- Cycle 4: 3-1-7-11-3
- Cycle 5: 3-1-13-4-3
- Cycle 6: 10-3-1-7-10
- Cycle 7: 10-3-1-14-10
- Cycle 8: 10-3-11-7-10
- Cycle 9: 10-8-4-13-10
- Cycle 10: 11-7-4-13-11
- Cycle 11: 11-3-1-7-11
- Cycle 12: 11-3-7-9-11
- Cycle 13: 11-3-10-8-11
- Cycle 14: 11-5-3-1-11
- Cycle 15: 11-5-8-4-11
- Cycle 16: 11-5-8-12-11

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 1-8
- Cycle 2 has a chord 1-13
- Cycle 3 has a chord 1-7
- Cycle 4 has a chord 1-11
- Cycle 5 has a chord 1-13
- Cycle 6 has a chord 1-7
- Cycle 7 has a chord 1-14
- Cycle 8 has a chord 1-11
- Cycle 9 has a chord 8-13
- Cycle 10 has a chord 7-13
- Cycle 11 has a chord 1-7
- Cycle 12 has a chord 3-9
- Cycle 13 has a chord 1-11
- Cycle 14 has a chord 1-8
- Cycle 15 has a chord 11-5
- Cycle 16 has a chord 5-12

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, (4, 8), 7>
- <1, (4, 13), 7>
- <1, (7, 1), 11>
- <3, (1, 7), 11>
- <3, (1, 13), 7>
- <10, (3, 1), 14>
- <10, (3, 11), 7>
- <11, (8, 4), 13>
- <11, (7, 4), 13>
- <11, (1, 3), 7>
- <11, (1, 11), 7>
- <11, (5, 8), 12>
