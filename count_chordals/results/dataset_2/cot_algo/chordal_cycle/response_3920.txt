- Cycle 32: 7-3-9-0-7
- Cycle 33: 7-5-4-1-7
- Cycle 34: 7-5-0-9-7
- Cycle 35: 7-2-1-3-7
- Cycle 36: 7-2-9-4-7
- Cycle 37: 9-3-1-4-9
- Cycle 38: 9-3-7-0-9
- Cycle 39: 9-4-1-2-9
- Cycle 40: 9-8-4-5-9

Step 2: Chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord):
- <1, (3, 2), 1>
- <1, (4, 9), 1>
- <1, (4, 8), 1>
- <3, (7, 0), 3>
- <4, (2, 7), 4>
- <5, (7, 0), 5>
- <6, (2, 9), 6>
- <8, (4, 5), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [8].
