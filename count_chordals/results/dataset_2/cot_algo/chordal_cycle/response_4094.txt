Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 2) (10, 9) (11, 3) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 11) (0, 5) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 19) (14, 13) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 16) (9, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 19) (4, 17) (12, 4) (12, 18) (12, 15) (12, 1) (12, 19) (18, 12) (19, 14) (19, 4) (19, 12) (19, 1) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 17) (16, 8) (16, 17) (16, 1) (17, 4) (17, 7) (17, 16) (1, 12) (1, 19) (1, 16) (2, 10) (2, 3) (13, 14) (13, 7) (13, 15) (15, 12) (15, 13) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (0, 14, 19, 4, 5, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 11, 3, 14, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 12, 4, 19, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 10, 9, 10, 2)
- Cycle 5: (3, 11, 6, 4, 5, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 11, 6, 8, 16, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 14, 13, 7, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 5, 0, 11, 3, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 5, 11, 6, 8, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 12, 1, 16, 8, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 12, 15, 13, 7, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 19, 12, 1, 16, 4)
- Cycle 13: (7, 3, 2, 10, 9, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 13, 14, 0, 11, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 13, 15, 12, 4, 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 17, 16, 8, 6, 7)
- Cycle 17: (8, 6, 11, 5, 4, 8)
- Cycle 18: (8, 16, 1, 12, 4, 8)
- Cycle 19: (12, 1, 16, 17, 7, 12)
- Cycle 20: (12, 4, 19, 1, 16, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal cycle 1: (0, 14, 19, 4, 5, 0) <(14, 4)>
- Chordal cycle 2: (4, 5, 0, 11, 3, 4) <(5, 3)>
- Chordal cycle 3: (12, 1, 16, 17, 7, 12) <(1, 17)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:

- There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found inside brackets [], so the final count is [3].
