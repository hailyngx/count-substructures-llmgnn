Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 10) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 1) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 12) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 6) (10, 4) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 7) (5, 4) (5, 10) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 4) (6, 13) (6, 5) (6, 14) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 10) (9, 14) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 5) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 9) (0, 4) (0, 12) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-13-6-4
- Cycle 2: 4-5-6-13-4
- Cycle 3: 4-10-13-7-4
- Cycle 4: 4-9-8-13-4
- Cycle 5: 4-6-14-7-4

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chord <7, 13>
- Cycle 2: Chord <5, 13>
- Cycle 3: Chord <10, 7>
- Cycle 4: Chord <9, 8>
- Cycle 5: Chord <6, 14>

Step 3:
Based on the cycles with exactly one chord, the chordless cycles found are:
- <4-5-6-13-4> with chord <5, 13>
- <4-9-8-13-4> with chord <9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
