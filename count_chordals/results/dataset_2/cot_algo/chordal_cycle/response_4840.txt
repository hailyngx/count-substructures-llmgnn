Prompt:
This graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges. The edges are as follows: (13, 22) (13, 20) (13, 9) (22, 13) (22, 10) (22, 3) (2, 24) (2, 14) (29, 7) (29, 24) (14, 2) (17, 10) (17, 5) (17, 27) (12, 27) (12, 6) (12, 1) (27, 17) (27, 12) (4, 5) (4, 16) (4, 25) (8, 26) (18, 26) (18, 28) (6, 12) (6, 28) (6, 21) (28, 18) (28, 6) (28, 26) (28, 0) (28, 24) (23, 5) (23, 7) (23, 10) (10, 22) (10, 17) (10, 23) (10, 7) (26, 8) (26, 18) (26, 28) (26, 16) (0, 28) (0, 7) (7, 29) (7, 23) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 15) (3, 22) (3, 21) (3, 19) (21, 6) (21, 3) (21, 19) (11, 5) (11, 25) (19, 3) (19, 21) (19, 25) (19, 16) (16, 4) (16, 26) (16, 19) (16, 20) (1, 12) (1, 20) (5, 17) (5, 4) (5, 23) (5, 11) (9, 13) (9, 25) (9, 20) (25, 4) (25, 11) (25, 19) (25, 9) (25, 15) (20, 13) (20, 16) (20, 1) (20, 9) (15, 7) (15, 25) (24, 2) (24, 29) (24, 28) 

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycle (10, 22, 3, 21) with chord (23, 5) is a chordal 4-cycle <10, 22, 3, 21>.
- The cycle (6, 12, 27, 17) with chord (5, 16) is a chordal 4-cycle <6, 12, 27, 17>.
- The cycle (16, 4, 5, 23) with chord (25, 11) is a chordal 4-cycle <16, 4, 5, 23>.
- The cycle (20, 13, 22, 10) with chord (9, 25) is a chordal 4-cycle <20, 13, 22, 10>.

Step 2:
- There are 4 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Step 3:
- The final number of chordal 4-cycles is [4].
