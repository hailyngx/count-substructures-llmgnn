Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 2 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 7 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 7 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 2 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 5: 9 - 8 - 2 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 1 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 7: 9 - 0 - 7 - 9
- Cycle 8: 9 - 3 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 9: 4 - 7 - 0 - 4
- Cycle 10: 4 - 6 - 2 - 4
- Cycle 11: 7 - 6 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 12: 7 - 0 - 3 - 7
- Cycle 13: 6 - 4 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 14: 6 - 2 - 8 - 6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 2, 8, 5> has chord (2, 8)
- <5, 7, 4, 5> has chord (7, 4)
- <5, 7, 0, 5> has chord (7, 0)
- <5, 2, 4, 5> has chord (2, 4)
- <9, 8, 2, 9> has chord (8, 2)
- <9, 1, 4, 9> has chord (1, 4)
- <9, 0, 7, 9> has chord (0, 7)
- <9, 3, 8, 9> has chord (3, 8)
- <4, 7, 0, 4> has chord (7, 0)
- <4, 6, 2, 4> has chord (6, 2)
- <7, 6, 2, 7> has chord (6, 2)
- <7, 0, 3, 7> has chord (0, 3)
- <6, 4, 1, 6> has chord (4, 1)
- <6, 2, 8, 6> has chord (2, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles is [14].
