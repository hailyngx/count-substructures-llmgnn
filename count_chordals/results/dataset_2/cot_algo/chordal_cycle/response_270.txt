Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 1, 2, 3, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 1, 7, 0, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 4, 2, 3, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 8, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 3, 2, 4, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 6, 7, 1, 5)
- Cycle 9: (9, 6, 7, 1, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 6, 8, 5, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 4, 2, 3, 9)
- Cycle 12: (6, 8, 0, 3, 6)
- Cycle 13: (1, 7, 6, 8, 1)
- Cycle 14: (3, 2, 1, 7, 3)
- Cycle 15: (4, 2, 1, 7, 4)
- Cycle 16: (8, 0, 1, 7, 8)
- Cycle 17: (2, 4, 0, 1, 2)

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 5> (Chord: (9, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 1, 2, 3, 5> (Chord: (1, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 1, 7, 0, 5> (Chord: (1, 0))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, 4, 2, 3, 5> (Chord: (4, 2))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 8, 6, 7, 5> (Chord: (8, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, 3, 2, 4, 5> (Chord: (3, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, 6, 7, 1, 5> (Chord: (6, 1))
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <9, 6, 8, 5, 9> (Chord: (6, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, 4, 2, 3, 9> (Chord: (4, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <6, 8, 0, 3, 6> (Chord: (8, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <1, 7, 6, 8, 1> (Chord: (7, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <3, 2, 1, 7, 3> (Chord: (2, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <4, 2, 1, 7, 4> (Chord: (2, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <8, 0, 1, 7, 8> (Chord: (0, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <2, 4, 0, 1, 2> (Chord: (4, 0))

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [15]
