Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 8) (12, 7) (12, 1) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (14, 12) (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 10) (5, 4) (5, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 5) (10, 7) (10, 8) (10, 14) (10, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 11) 

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 6, 8, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 13, 8, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 2, 7, 13, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 2, 7, 12, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 2, 5, 4, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 9, 14, 12, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 9, 4, 5, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 9, 14, 10, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 12, 7, 10, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 8, 13, 3, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 8, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 8, 6, 3, 1)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Only Cycle 5 <1, 2, 5, 4, 1> has exactly one chord, which is the edge (2, 4).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
