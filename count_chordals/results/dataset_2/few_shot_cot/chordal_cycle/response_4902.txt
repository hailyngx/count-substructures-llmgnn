Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
1. <0, 5, 1, 6, 0>
2. <0, 5, 4, 7, 0>
3. <0, 5, 9, 7, 0>
4. <0, 9, 7, 4, 0>
5. <1, 5, 4, 7, 1>
6. <3, 9, 7, 4, 3>
7. <4, 5, 9, 7, 4>
8. <5, 6, 7, 9, 5>
9. <5, 6, 2, 7, 5>
10. <6, 7, 9, 5, 6>

Step 2:
Chords in the cycles:
1. <0, 5, 1, 6, 0> - Chord: (5, 1)
2. <0, 5, 4, 7, 0> - Chord: (5, 4)
3. <0, 5, 9, 7, 0> - Chord: (5, 9)
4. <0, 9, 7, 4, 0> - Chord: (9, 4)
5. <1, 5, 4, 7, 1> - Chord: (5, 4)
6. <3, 9, 7, 4, 3> - Chord: (9, 4)
7. <4, 5, 9, 7, 4> - Chord: (5, 9)
8. <5, 6, 7, 9, 5> - Chord: (6, 9)
9. <5, 6, 2, 7, 5> - Chord: (6, 2)

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <6, (7, 2), 5>
