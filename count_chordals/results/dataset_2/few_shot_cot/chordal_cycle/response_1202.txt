- Cycle <25, 26, 8, 26, 13, 20, 22, 11, 24, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycle <1, 5, 16, 6, 1> with chord (1, 6)
- Chordal cycle <24, 14, 24, 3, 22, 11, 19, 23, 5> with chord (3, 19)
- Chordal cycle <25, 26, 8, 26, 13, 20, 22, 11, 24, 3> with chord (8, 20)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the count is [3].
