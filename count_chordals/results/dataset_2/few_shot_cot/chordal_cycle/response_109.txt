- (0, 8, 4, 1) is a cycle of length 4
- (0, 8, 4, 10, 13) is a cycle of length 5
- (0, 8, 4, 1, 3) is a cycle of length 5
- (0, 8, 4, 12, 13) is a cycle of length 5
- (0, 5, 3, 7) is a cycle of length 4
- (0, 5, 3, 1, 4) is a cycle of length 5
- (0, 5, 3, 7, 2) is a cycle of length 5
- (0, 5, 13, 12) is a cycle of length 4
- (0, 5, 13, 10, 14) is a cycle of length 5
- (0, 5, 13, 12, 4) is a cycle of length 5
- (0, 11, 14, 10) is a cycle of length 4
- (0, 11, 14, 12, 13) is a cycle of length 5
- (0, 11, 14, 10, 4) is a cycle of length 5
- (1, 3, 7, 2) is a cycle of length 4
- (1, 3, 7, 2, 4) is a cycle of length 5
- (1, 3, 9, 4) is a cycle of length 4
- (1, 3, 9, 12, 13) is a cycle of length 5
- (1, 13, 5, 0) is a cycle of length 4
- (1, 13, 5, 3, 7) is a cycle of length 5
- (1, 14, 11, 0) is a cycle of length 4
- (1, 14, 11, 9, 12) is a cycle of length 5
- (4, 2, 7, 3) is a cycle of length 4
- (4, 2, 7, 3, 1) is a cycle of length 5
- (4, 2, 7, 3, 5) is a cycle of length 5
- (4, 8, 10, 13) is a cycle of length 4

- (9, 11, 14, 10) is a cycle of length 4
- (9, 11, 14, 12, 13) is a cycle of length 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle (0, 8, 4, 1) has a chord (4, 8)
- The cycle (0, 5, 3, 7) has a chord (3, 5)
- The cycle (0, 11, 14, 10) has a chord (10, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 8, 4, 1>
<0, 5, 3, 7>
<0, 11, 14, 10>
