Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 11, 8, 0> with chord 11-8
- Cycle 2: <3, 6, 15, 17, 3> with chord 15-17
- Cycle 3: <5, 10, 19, 7, 5> with chord 19-7
- Cycle 4: <16, 1, 18, 3, 16> with chord 18-3
- Cycle 5: <16, 1, 8, 14, 16> with chord 8-14
- Cycle 6: <16, 2, 9, 0, 16> with chord 9-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, 8, 11, 7, 1> with chord 11-7
- Chordal cycle 2: <3, 6, 15, 17, 3> with chord 15-17
- Chordal cycle 3: <5, 10, 19, 7, 5> with chord 19-7
- Chordal cycle 4: <16, 1, 18, 3, 16> with chord 18-3
- Chordal cycle 5: <16, 1, 8, 14, 16> with chord 8-14
- Chordal cycle 6: <16, 2, 9, 0, 16> with chord 9-0

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of [6] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
