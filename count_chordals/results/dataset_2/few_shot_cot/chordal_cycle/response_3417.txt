- Cycle 29: <9, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 30: <9, 6, 2, 8>
- Cycle 31: <10, 0, 5, 12>
- Cycle 32: <10, 1, 9, 5>
- Cycle 33: <11, 3, 7, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 4, 1, 9>, Chord: (0, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 8, 5, 12>, Chord: (5, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 9, 14, 11>, Chord: (9, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 10, 0, 5>, Chord: (0, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 10, 12, 2>, Chord: (10, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 6, 13, 0>, Chord: (6, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 7, 8, 5>, Chord: (3, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 11, 14, 9>, Chord: (14, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 1, 10, 0>, Chord: (1, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 7, 3, 1>, Chord: (6, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 1, 10, 0>, Chord: (1, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <12, 5, 8, 3>, Chord: (5, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 29 chordless 4-cycles in the graph.
Therefore, the final count is [29].
