Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, 2, 29, 5> with chord (2, 29)
<1, 27, 24, 3> with chord (24, 27)
<4, 29, 2, 14> with chord (2, 29)
<6, 12, 16, 26> with chord (12, 16)
<7, 25, 15, 11> with chord (15, 25)
<8, 23, 14, 2> with chord (14, 23)
<9, 10, 5, 29> with chord (10, 29)
<13, 17, 22, 0> with chord (17, 22)
<19, 22, 0, 14> with chord (0, 22)

Step 3:
There are a total of 9 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final answer is [9].
