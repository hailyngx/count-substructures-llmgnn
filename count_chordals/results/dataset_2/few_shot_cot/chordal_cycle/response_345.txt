Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 5, 4, 6, 9>: (0, 5), (5, 4), (4, 6), (6, 9), (9, 0)
- Cycle <0, 5, 7, 2, 9>: (0, 5), (5, 7), (7, 2), (2, 9), (9, 0)
- Cycle <0, 5, 4, 8, 2>: (0, 5), (5, 4), (4, 8), (8, 2), (2, 0)
- Cycle <0, 5, 3, 7, 2>: (0, 5), (5, 3), (3, 7), (7, 2), (2, 0)
- Cycle <1, 4, 6, 9, 2>: (1, 4), (4, 6), (6, 9), (9, 2), (2, 1)
- Cycle <2, 7, 5, 9, 6>: (2, 7), (7, 5), (5, 9), (9, 6), (6, 2)
- Cycle <3, 5, 9, 6, 4>: (3, 5), (5, 9), (9, 6), (6, 4), (4, 3)

Step 2:
Out of the listed cycles above, the cycle <0, 5, 4, 6, 9> has one chord: (4, 9). Therefore, this is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
The final number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, 4, 6, 9>, (4, 9)
