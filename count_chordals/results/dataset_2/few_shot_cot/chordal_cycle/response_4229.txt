Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 9, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 7, 9, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 6, 9, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 9, 8, 0>
- Cycle 5: <4, 9, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 6: <9, 6, 7, 3, 9>
- Cycle 7: <6, 7, 3, 0, 6>
- Cycle 8: <3, 7, 0, 4, 3>
- Cycle 9: <0, 8, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 10: <5, 8, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle 11: <3, 6, 2, 5, 3>
- Cycle 12: <3, 7, 9, 8, 3>
- Cycle 13: <1, 4, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle 14: <2, 9, 8, 5, 2>
- Cycle 15: <0, 7, 6, 2, 0>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 6, 9, 4, 0> has chord (6, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 4, 9, 8, 0> has chord (4, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <9, 6, 7, 3, 9> has chord (6, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
Since we found 3 chordal 4-cycles, the number of chordless cycles is [12].
