Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - One cycle (chordless cycle): <16, 4, 10, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - The cycle <16, 4, 10, 13> has a chord between nodes 4 and 10.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - Since there are no chordless cycles found, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
        
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <16, 4, 10, 13>.
