Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles with length 4: 
- Cycle 1: (0, 3, 9, 1, 17, 12, 7, 2, 8, 11) 
- Cycle 2: (0, 3, 13, 16, 12, 7, 2, 19, 9) 
- Cycle 3: (0, 10, 18, 11, 17, 12, 7, 1, 14) 
- Cycle 4: (0, 10, 18, 13, 16, 12, 17, 11) 
- Cycle 5: (1, 7, 12, 17, 11, 18, 14, 15) 
- Cycle 6: (1, 7, 12, 16, 13, 18, 14, 17) 
- Cycle 7: (1, 9, 19, 18, 14, 15, 4, 19) 
- Cycle 8: (1, 9, 19, 18, 13, 16, 12, 2)
  
Step 2: 
Checking for chords in the cycles: 
- Cycle 1 has no chord. 
- Cycle 2 has no chord. 
- Cycle 3 has the chord (14, 17). 
- Cycle 4 has the chord (16, 18). 
- Cycle 5 has no chord. 
- Cycle 6 has the chord (13, 14). 
- Cycle 7 has no chord. 
- Cycle 8 has no chord. 
  
Step 3: 
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<3, (14, 17)>
<4, (16, 18)>
<6, (13, 14)>
