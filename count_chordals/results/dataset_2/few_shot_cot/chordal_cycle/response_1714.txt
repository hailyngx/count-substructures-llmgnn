Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 13, 5, 6> (Chord: (0, 13))
- <1, 11, 4, 7> (Chord: (1, 11))
- <1, 11, 4, 12> (Chord: (1, 11))
- <2, 7, 10, 14> (Chord: (7, 10))
- <3, 14, 9, 6> (Chord: (3, 9))
- <4, 11, 8, 1> (Chord: (8, 11))
- <5, 6, 13, 0> (Chord: (5, 13))
- <5, 6, 13, 2> (Chord: (5, 13))
- <6, 9, 14, 7> (Chord: (9, 14))
- <7, 4, 11, 9> (Chord: (4, 11))
- <9, 10, 4, 12> (Chord: (4, 12))
- <10, 7, 4, 12> (Chord: (7, 4))
- <11, 8, 1, 11> (Chord: (8, 1))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 2
So, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
