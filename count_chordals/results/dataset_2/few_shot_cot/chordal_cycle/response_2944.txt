Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <4, 7, 5, 8, 4>
- Cycle 2: <3, 7, 4, 6, 3>
- Cycle 3: <4, 1, 0, 2, 4>
- Cycle 4: <7, 4, 1, 0, 7>
- Cycle 5: <5, 7, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 6: <2, 3, 7, 5, 2>
- Cycle 7: <9, 4, 1, 0, 9>
- Cycle 8: <6, 4, 1, 0, 6>
- Cycle 9: <2, 8, 5, 7, 2>
- Cycle 10: <3, 9, 4, 6, 3>
- Cycle 11: <2, 5, 8, 0, 2>
- Cycle 12: <4, 9, 2, 3, 4>
- Cycle 13: <1, 0, 2, 9, 1>
- Cycle 14: <9, 7, 3, 6, 9>
- Cycle 15: <6, 7, 9, 0, 6>
- Cycle 16: <3, 2, 0, 1, 3>
- Cycle 17: <5, 8, 0, 1, 5>
- Cycle 18: <7, 3, 2, 9, 7>
- Cycle 19: <8, 5, 4, 9, 8>
- Cycle 20: <9, 3, 6, 4, 9>


Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 0)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (4, 0)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (7, 6)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (3, 7)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (4, 0)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (4, 0)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (7, 5)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (8, 5)
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 13 has one chord: (2, 9)
- Cycle 14 has one chord: (7, 6)
- Cycle 15 has one chord: (9, 0)
- Cycle 16 has one chord: (2, 1)
- Cycle 17 has one chord: (8, 1)
- Cycle 18 has one chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 19 has one chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 20 has one chord: (3, 4)


Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles.

There are 20 cycles with exactly one chord, so the number of chordal 4-cycles is [20].
