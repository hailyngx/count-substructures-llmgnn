Step 2: Checking for chords:
<5, (1, 6), 7> - Chord: (1, 6)
<5, (2, 8), 9> - Chord: (2, 8)
<5, (2, 1), 6> - Chord: (2, 1)
<5, (7, 0), 4> - Chord: (7, 0)
<5, (7, 4), 9> - Chord: (7, 4)
<5, (8, 3), 9> - Chord: (8, 3)
<5, (8, 4), 9> - Chord: (8, 4)
<9, (0, 4), 7> - Chord: (0, 4)
<9, (4, 7), 5> - Chord: (4, 7) 
<9, (4, 8), 5> - Chord: (4, 8)
<4, (0, 7), 5> - Chord: (0, 7)
<4, (7, 5), 8> - Chord: (7, 5)
<7, (5, 1), 6> - Chord: (5, 1)
<6, (1, 5), 7> - Chord: (1, 5)
<8, (5, 7), 6> - Chord: (5, 7)
