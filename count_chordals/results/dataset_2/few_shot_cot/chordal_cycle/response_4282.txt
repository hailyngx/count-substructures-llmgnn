Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 3, 1, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 7, 0, 6, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 9, 3, 0, 6, 5>
- Cycle 6: <9, 7, 4, 1, 9>
- Cycle 7: <9, 7, 0, 6, 5, 9>
- Cycle 8: <9, 7, 0, 1, 4, 9>
- Cycle 9: <9, 7, 0, 3, 1, 9>
- Cycle 10: <4, 7, 0, 1, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 7, 9, 5, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 7, 9, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle 13: <4, 7, 9, 3, 0, 6, 5, 4>
- Cycle 14: <4, 7, 9, 3, 0, 1, 4>
- Cycle 15: <7, 9, 5, 4, 7>
- Cycle 16: <7, 9, 5, 6, 0, 7>
- Cycle 17: <7, 9, 3, 0, 1, 4, 7>
- Cycle 18: <7, 9, 3, 0, 1, 5, 4, 7>
- Cycle 19: <1, 4, 7, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle 20: <1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 1>
- Cycle 21: <1, 4, 7, 0, 6, 5, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle 22: <1, 4, 7, 0, 6, 5, 9, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 23: <3, 9, 5, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle 24: <3, 9, 7, 4, 1, 3>
- Cycle 25: <3, 9, 7, 0, 6, 5, 4, 1, 3>
- Cycle 26: <3, 9, 7, 0, 1, 4, 5, 3>
- Cycle 27: <6, 5, 9, 7, 0, 1, 4, 6>
- Cycle 28: <6, 5, 9, 7, 0, 3, 1, 4, 6>
- Cycle 29: <2, 7, 9, 5, 8, 2>
- Cycle 30: <2, 7, 9, 3, 0, 6, 5, 8, 2>
- Cycle 31: <2, 7, 4, 1, 3, 9, 5, 8, 2>
- Cycle 32: <2, 7, 4, 1, 0, 6, 5, 8, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 4: <5, 9, 3, 0, 6, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- As there is only one chordal 4-cycle, the count is [1].
