Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 2, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 3, 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 7, 1, 6, 4, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 7, 2, 4, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 5, 2, 7, 1, 6, 4, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 9, 8, 2, 7, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 4, 6, 9, 8, 3, 5, 7, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 6, 1, 7, 5, 3, 8, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 7, 5, 3, 8, 9, 6, 1, 7, 2>
- Cycle 10: <4, 6, 1, 7, 5, 3, 8, 9, 4>
- Cycle 11: <5, 3, 8, 9, 6, 1, 7, 5>
  
Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the cycle with exactly one chord (a non-adjacent edge connecting two vertices in the cycle) is Cycle 2: <0, 5, 3, 8, 0>.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [10]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, 5, 3, 8, 0>
