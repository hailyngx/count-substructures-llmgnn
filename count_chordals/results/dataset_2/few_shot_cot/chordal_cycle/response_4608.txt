Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 1, 6, 14>
- <0, 1, 6, 7>
- <0, 1, 14, 5>
- <0, 2, 9, 6>
- <0, 2, 9, 12>
- <0, 2, 12, 5>
- <0, 3, 6, 9>
- <0, 5, 8, 2>
- <0, 5, 12, 9>
- <0, 7, 6, 3>
- <0, 7, 3, 11>
- <0, 10, 4, 8>
- <0, 10, 8, 5>
- <1, 6, 9, 2>
- <1, 6, 14, 9>
- <1, 6, 7, 3>
- <1, 14, 9, 12>
- <2, 9, 6, 3>
- <2, 9, 12, 11>
- <2, 12, 5, 0>
- <2, 8, 5, 0>
- <2, 11, 3, 7>
- <3, 6, 9, 12>
- <3, 6, 7, 0>
- <3, 9, 12, 11>
- <4, 10, 8, 5>
- <4, 10, 13, 10>
- <5, 12, 9, 6>
- <5, 12, 11, 3>
- <5, 14, 6, 9>
- <5, 14, 9, 2>
- <5, 14, 8, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, (6, 14), 5>
- <0, 7, (6, 3), 11>
- <0, 2, (9, 12), 5>
- <0, 5, (8, 2), 9>
- <1, (6, 9), 2>
- <1, (6, 7), 3>
- <1, (14, 9), 12>
- <2, 9, (6, 3)>
- <2, 9, (12, 11)>
- <2, 12, (5, 0)>
- <2, 8, (5, 0)>
- <2, 11, (3, 7)>
- <3, 6, (9, 12)>
- <3, 6, (7, 0)>
- <3, 9, (12, 11)>
- <4, 10, (8, 5)>
- <4, 10, (13, 10)>
- <5, 12, (9, 6)>
- <5, 12, (11, 3)>
- <5, 14, (6, 9)>
- <5, 14, (8, 10)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are a total of [1] chordal 4-cycle in the graph.
