Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- One cycle of length 4: <5, 4, 2, 6>
- One cycle of length 5: <5, 4, 2, 1, 6>
- One cycle of length 6: <5, 7, 3, 6, 2, 4>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <5, 4, 2, 6> has the chord (4, 6)
- <5, 4, 2, 1, 6> does not have a chord
- <5, 7, 3, 6, 2, 4> has the chord (7, 2)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, 4, 2, 6>
<5, 7, 3, 6, 2, 4>
