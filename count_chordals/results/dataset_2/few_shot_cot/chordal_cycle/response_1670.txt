Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 12) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 9) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 14) (12, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 9) (14, 10) (14, 12) (14, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 11) (5, 13) (13, 12) (13, 5) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (2, 4) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle <3, 7, 9, 1, 3>
- Cycle <3, 10, 2, 9, 3>
- Cycle <3, 10, 14, 6, 3>
- Cycle <3, 5, 11, 10, 3>
- Cycle <3, 5, 11, 1, 3>
- Cycle <3, 8, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle <3, 8, 9, 1, 3>
- Cycle <3, 8, 10, 2, 3>
- Cycle <3, 8, 10, 14, 3>
- Cycle <3, 8, 10, 5, 3>
- Cycle <6, 12, 14, 10, 6>
- Cycle <6, 14, 10, 3, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, 7, 9, 1, 3> has a chord: (9, 1)
- <3, 10, 2, 9, 3> has a chord: (2, 9)
- <3, 5, 11, 10, 3> has a chord: (11, 10)
- <3, 5, 11, 1, 3> has a chord: (11, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 10 chordless 4-cycles found, thus [10].
