Response:
The total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph can be counted as follows:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <3, 15, 0, 23>
- <3, 15, 24, 5>
- <3, 26, 8, 4>
- <3, 26, 8, 10>
- <15, 0, 23, 10>
- <15, 0, 16, 22>
- <15, 24, 29, 2>
- <3, 15, 22, 27>
- <2, 29, 24, 5>
- <2, 29, 24, 15>
- <10, 17, 4, 8>
- <10, 17, 4, 27>
- <4, 17, 10, 23>
- <4, 17, 9, 27>
- <8, 10, 23, 0>
- <8, 26, 3, 18>
- <13, 16, 21, 10>
- <13, 16, 22, 27>
- <13, 16, 21, 3>
- <8, 26, 3, 15>
- <1, 2, 29, 24>
- <21, 16, 22, 27>
- <21, 16, 13, 6>
- <21, 3, 15, 24>
- <16, 22, 27, 9>
- <16, 22, 27, 6>
- <16, 0, 15, 24>
- <22, 27, 9, 14>
- <22, 20, 5, 24>
- <22, 20, 5, 15>
- <0, 23, 14, 29>
- <9, 27, 6, 13>
- <9, 27, 22, 19>
- <12, 25, 19, 22>
- <25, 28, 20, 22>
- <28, 20, 5, 24>
- <23, 10, 17, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- We find the following unique chordal 4-cycle with a chord: <4, 8, (10, 17), 23>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- As there was only one chordal 4-cycle with a chord found, the number of chordless cycles is [37].
