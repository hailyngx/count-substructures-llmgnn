Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (3, 1, 10, 15)
- Cycle 2: (4, 11, 13, 5)
- Cycle 3: (8, 2, 19, 1)
- Cycle 4: (8, 2, 18, 15)
- Cycle 5: (8, 10, 1, 3)
- Cycle 6: (8, 10, 15, 18)
- Cycle 7: (8, 10, 15, 12)
- Cycle 8: (8, 10, 1, 19)
- Cycle 9: (13, 5, 16, 3)
- Cycle 10: (13, 5, 16, 6)
- Cycle 11: (13, 5, 14, 2)
- Cycle 12: (13, 12, 15, 10)
- Cycle 13: (13, 12, 15, 18)
- Cycle 14: (13, 12, 15, 9)
- Cycle 15: (2, 8, 0, 17)
- Cycle 16: (2, 8, 0, 5)
- Cycle 17: (2, 8, 10, 15)
- Cycle 18: (2, 8, 10, 1)
- Cycle 19: (2, 8, 10, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, (1, 10), 15)> with chord (1, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <13, (11, 5), 16)> with chord (11, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <8, (2, 19), 1)> with chord (2, 19)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, (2, 18), 15)> with chord (2, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
As there are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the number inside brackets is [4].
