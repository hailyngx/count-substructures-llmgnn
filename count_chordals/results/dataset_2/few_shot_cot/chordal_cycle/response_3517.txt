Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 18, 14> (with chord 9-14)
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 14, 3> (no chords)
- Cycle 3: <5, 0, 6, 11> (no chords)
- Cycle 4: <5, 19, 13, 15> (no chords)
- Cycle 5: <9, 18, 11, 6> (with chord 6-11)
- Cycle 6: <9, 14, 4, 15> (with chord 4-15)
- Cycle 7: <6, 11, 18, 14> (with chord 11-14)
- Cycle 8: <6, 16, 17, 2> (no chords)
- Cycle 9: <6, 1, 8, 15> (no chords)
- Cycle 10: <6, 4, 14, 9> (no chords)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- There are 2 cycles with exactly one chord: <5, 9, 18, 14> and <6, 11, 18, 14>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [23]
