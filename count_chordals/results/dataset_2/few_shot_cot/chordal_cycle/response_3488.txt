Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, 6, 9, 4, 1> - Chord: (1, 9)
- <1, 6, 3, 1> - Chord: (1, 3)
- <1, 6, 2, 5, 1> - Chord: (1, 5)
- <9, 6, 11, 8, 9> - Chord: (9, 8)
- <9, 4, 5, 10, 13, 7, 9> - Chord: (9, 13)
- <6, 11, 10, 5, 2, 6> - Chord: (6, 5)
- <9, 8, 14, 10, 11, 9> - Chord: (9, 10)
- <5, 10, 11, 6, 2, 5> - Chord: (5, 11)
- <13, 7, 9, 12, 13> - Chord: (13, 9)
- <7, 9, 8, 14, 10, 13, 7> - Chord: (7, 14)
- <8, 9, 6, 11, 12, 8> - Chord: (8, 11)
- <8, 12, 0, 7, 13, 12> - Chord: (8, 7)
- <14, 8, 11, 6, 14> - Chord: (14, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [13]
