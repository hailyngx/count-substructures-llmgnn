Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph, but not all of them have exactly one chord. Let's list the cycles with exactly one chord:

1. <1, 3, 12, 0> with a chord 1-12
2. <1, 6, 4, 9> with a chord 1-4
3. <1, 7, 14, 6> with a chord 1-14
4. <3, 6, 10, 12> with a chord 3-10
5. <3, 13, 8, 5> with a chord 3-8
6. <7, 14, 6, 10> with a chord 7-6

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, the following cycles are chordal 4-cycles as they have exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 12, 0> with chord 1-12
- <1, 6, 4, 9> with chord 1-4
- <1, 7, 14, 6> with chord 1-14

Step 3:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found as shown above, so the final count is [3].
