Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-9-8-0
- Cycle 2: 1-3-4-7-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-4-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-14-9-7-1
- Cycle 5: 2-4-7-14-2
- Cycle 6: 3-4-2-13-3
- Cycle 7: 3-10-0-11-3
- Cycle 8: 6-4-7-13-6

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 6: <3, (4, 13), 2>

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles found: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <3, (4, 13), 2>
