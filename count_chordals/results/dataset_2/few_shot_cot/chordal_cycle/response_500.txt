Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <5, 9, 29, 28> with the chord (5, 29).

Following the steps:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
  - Cycle 1: <5, 9, 29, 28>
  - Cycle 2: <9, 29, 28, 5>
  - Cycle 3: <9, 14, 2, 4>
  - Cycle 4: <9, 14, 21, 15>
  - Cycle 5: <9, 14, 21, 25>
  - Cycle 6: <9, 14, 2, 6>
  - Cycle 7: <9, 23, 13, 7>
  - Cycle 8: <9, 23, 13, 17>
  - Cycle 9: <9, 23, 24, 6>
  - Cycle 10: <29, 28, 12, 27>
  - Cycle 11: <29, 28, 27, 19>
  - Cycle 12: <29, 25, 21, 15>
  - Cycle 13: <29, 25, 21, 14>
  - Cycle 14: <29, 25, 4, 17>
  - Cycle 15: <29, 25, 4, 15>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord:
  - Only <5, 9, 29, 28> has a chord (5, 29)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [14].
