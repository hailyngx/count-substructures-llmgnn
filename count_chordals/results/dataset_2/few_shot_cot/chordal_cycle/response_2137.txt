Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 0

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <0, 5, 3, 9>. 

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 9, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 8, 7, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 6, 5, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 4, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 3, 0, 5, 2>
- Cycle 6: <3, 1, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 7: <3, 1, 5, 0, 3>
- Cycle 8: <3, 9, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 9, 7, 0, 3>
- Cycle 10: <4, 1, 6, 8, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 6, 2, 8, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 8, 7, 9, 4>
- Cycle 13: <5, 1, 4, 9, 5>
- Cycle 14: <5, 3, 9, 4, 5>
- Cycle 15: <6, 1, 5, 3, 6>
- Cycle 16: <6, 2, 3, 9, 6>
- Cycle 17: <7, 0, 3, 9, 7>
- Cycle 18: <8, 4, 9, 7, 8>
  
Step 2: Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- In cycle 1, no chord present.
- In cycle 2, no chord present.
- In cycle 3, no chord present.
- In cycle 4, chord <4, 9> is present.
- In cycle 5, no chord present.
- In cycle 6, no chord present.
- In cycle 7, no chord present.
- In cycle 8, no chord present.
- In cycle 9, no chord present.
- In cycle 10, no chord present.
- In cycle 11, no chord present.
- In cycle 12, no chord present.
- In cycle 13, no chord present.
- In cycle 14, chord <4, 9> is present.
- In cycle 15, no chord present.
- In cycle 16, no chord present.
- In cycle 17, no chord present.
- In cycle 18, no chord present.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
- There are 2 chordal 4-cycles: <0, 5, 3, 9> with chords <4, 9>.

Therefore, the final count is [2].
