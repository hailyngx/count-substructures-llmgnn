Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 9, 6>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 7, 2, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (7, 9).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (7, 2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 4, 7, 3, 1>
<7, 6, 9, 7, 4>
