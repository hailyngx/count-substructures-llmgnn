Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 6, 4, 7, 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 5, 3, 7, 8, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 6, 4, 7, 2>
- Cycle 5: <2, 4, 7, 8, 2>
- Cycle 6: <9, 6, 2, 7, 9>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Checking Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 8, 0> has one chord (1, 8).
- Checking Cycle 2: <0, 9, 6, 4, 7, 8, 0> has one chord (6, 8).
- Checking Cycle 3: <1, 5, 3, 7, 8, 1> has one chord (3, 7).
- Checking Cycle 4: <2, 6, 4, 7, 2> has one chord (4, 7).
- Checking Cycle 5: <2, 4, 7, 8, 2> has one chord (7, 8).
- Checking Cycle 6: <9, 6, 2, 7, 9> has one chord (2, 7).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0 since all cycles have one chord.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
