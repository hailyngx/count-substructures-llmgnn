Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <0, 9, 7, 1, 0>
2. <1, 6, 5, 2, 1>
3. <2, 6, 1, 7, 2>
4. <3, 1, 7, 0, 3>
5. <4, 3, 1, 6, 4>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. <0, 9, 7, 1, 0> has a chord 9-1
2. <1, 6, 5, 2, 1> does not have a chord
3. <2, 6, 1, 7, 2> does not have a chord
4. <3, 1, 7, 0, 3> has a chord 1-7
5. <4, 3, 1, 6, 4> does not have a chord

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
[3]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, 6, 5, 2, 1>
