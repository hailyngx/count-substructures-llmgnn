Node 13 is connected to node 8, 12, 2, 10, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 0, 11, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are three cycles of length 4 in the graph: (0, 9, 13, 12), (3, 4, 8, 1), and (5, 6, 2, 12).

Step 2:
- Only the cycle (0, 9, 13, 12) has exactly one chord which is the edge between nodes 13 and 9.

Step 3:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<0, 9, 13, 12>
