Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4: 
- (5, 9, 6, 5)
- (4, 9, 6, 5)
- (4, 5, 3, 4)
- (4, 5, 8, 4)
- (8, 5, 9, 8)
- (3, 5, 9, 3)
- (3, 4, 9, 3)
- (2, 5, 6, 2)
- (2, 6, 9, 2)
- (2, 6, 5, 2)
- (2, 5, 8, 2)
- (2, 8, 4, 2)
- (2, 4, 7, 2)
- (0, 8, 4, 0)
- (0, 8, 5, 0)
- (0, 2, 5, 0)
- (0, 2, 6, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles: 
- <1, (2, 3), 5>
- <1, (2, 5), 6>
- <3, (4, 5), 9>
- <3, (4, 9), 5>
- <2, (5, 6), 9>
- <2, (5, 9), 6>
- <0, (2, 8), 5>
- <0, (2, 5), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [8].
