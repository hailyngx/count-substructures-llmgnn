Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, 0, 7, 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2:
