Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 16, 10, 17, 5, 12, 11, 2, 4, 13, 6, 9, 15, 1>
- Cycle <0, 16, 10, 17, 8, 19, 9, 6, 2, 11, 1>
- Cycle <0, 16, 10, 3, 4, 13, 6, 9, 15, 12, 11, 2>
- Cycle <0, 16, 10, 19, 8, 17, 7, 8, 17, 5, 12, 11, 2>
- Cycle <0, 13, 4, 2, 6, 9, 15, 1, 11, 12, 5, 17>

Step 2:
The cycle <0, 16, 10, 17, 5, 12, 11, 2, 4, 13, 6, 9, 15, 1> has exactly one chord (6, 15).
The cycle <0, 16, 10, 17, 8, 19, 9, 6, 2, 11, 1> has exactly one chord (9, 11).
The cycle <0, 13, 4, 2, 6, 9, 15, 1, 11, 12, 5, 17> has exactly one chord (2, 15).

Step 3:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
- <0, 16, 10, 17, 5, 12, 11, 2, 4, 13, 6, 9, 15, 1>
- <0, 16, 10, 17, 8, 19, 9, 6, 2, 11, 1>
- <0, 13, 4, 2, 6, 9, 15, 1, 11, 12, 5, 17>

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
