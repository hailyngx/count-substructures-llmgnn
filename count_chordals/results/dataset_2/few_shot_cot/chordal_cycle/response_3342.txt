Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 11) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 12) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 13) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 10) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 5) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 13) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 3) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 12) (10, 4) (10, 7) (10, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 2, 11, 12, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 11
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 9, 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 14, 6, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 10, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 2, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 12, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 10, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 5, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 2, 14, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 14
Node 12 is connected to node 3, 6, 0, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 9, and node 12
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 9, 11, and node 5

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 3, 7, 5> with chord (0, 7)
- Cycle <0, 3, 12, 6> with chord (3, 6)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- <0, 3, 7, 5> has one chord (0, 7)
- <0, 3, 12, 6> has one chord (3, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
As there were no chordless cycles found, the final count is [0].
