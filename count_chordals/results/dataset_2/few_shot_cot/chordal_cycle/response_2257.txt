Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (15, 20, 7, 1, 15)
- Cycle 2: (15, 17, 1, 27, 25, 15)
- Cycle 3: (15, 17, 25, 19, 22, 14, 20, 15)
- Cycle 4: (15, 17, 25, 27, 4, 26, 22, 19, 25, 15)
- Cycle 5: (15, 8, 10, 26, 4, 27, 1, 13, 12, 28, 15)
- Cycle 6: (15, 8, 10, 26, 22, 19, 25, 29, 23, 14, 20, 15)
- Cycle 7: (15, 8, 10, 26, 22, 19, 12, 6, 16, 24, 17, 15)
- Cycle 8: (15, 17, 24, 16, 6, 18, 28, 12, 19, 22, 14, 20, 15)
- Cycle 9: (15, 17, 24, 16, 6, 12, 13, 11, 26, 4, 27, 25, 15)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Cycle 1 has the chord (20, 1)
- Cycle 2 has the chord (17, 27)
- Cycle 3 has the chord (25, 19)
- Cycle 4 has the chord (17, 22)
- Cycle 5 has the chord (26, 12)
- Cycle 6 has the chord (19, 23)
- Cycle 7 has the chord (10, 24)
- Cycle 8 has the chord (17, 28)
- Cycle 9 has the chord (16, 4)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordless 4-cycles in this graph.
