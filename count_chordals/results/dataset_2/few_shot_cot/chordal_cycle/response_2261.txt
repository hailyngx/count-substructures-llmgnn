Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <6, 9, 4, 1, 9>
- Cycle 2: <6, 9, 2, 4, 6>
- Cycle 3: <6, 9, 1, 4, 6>
- Cycle 4: <6, 9, 2, 8, 6>
- Cycle 5: <6, 9, 8, 5, 6>
- Cycle 6: <6, 9, 4, 5, 6>
- Cycle 7: <6, 9, 2, 0, 6>
- Cycle 8: <6, 9, 8, 2, 6>
- Cycle 9: <6, 9, 1, 8, 6>
- Cycle 10: <6, 9, 1, 9>
- Cycle 11: <6, 9, 8, 6>
- Cycle 12: <6, 9, 4, 9>
- Cycle 13: <6, 9, 4, 2, 6>
- Cycle 14: <6, 9, 2, 9>
- Cycle 15: <6, 9, 4, 6>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <6, 9, 4, 1, 9> with the chord (4, 1)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [14]
