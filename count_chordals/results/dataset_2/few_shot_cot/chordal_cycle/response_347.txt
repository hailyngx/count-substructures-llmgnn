Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 4, 13>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 12, 6>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 5, 9>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 14, 10>
- Cycle 5: <0, 10, 14, 7>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 13, 9>
- Cycle 7: <1, 5, 6, 3>
- Cycle 8: <1, 14, 7, 4>
- Cycle 9: <2, 5, 13, 4>
- Cycle 10: <2, 12, 8, 4>
- Cycle 11: <3, 7, 4, 6>
- Cycle 12: <3, 6, 12, 8>
- Cycle 13: <3, 14, 10, 0>
- Cycle 14: <4, 7, 14, 10>
- Cycle 15: <5, 9, 13, 4>
- Cycle 16: <5, 6, 3, 7>
- Cycle 17: <6, 5, 1, 0>
- Cycle 18: <6, 4, 8, 12>
- Cycle 19: <7, 4, 8, 12>
- Cycle 20: <7, 14, 10, 0>
- Cycle 21: <8, 4, 13, 0>
- Cycle 22: <10, 14, 7, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 8, 12, 6> (Chord: (8, 12))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 1, 14, 10> (Chord: (1, 14))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 5, 13, 9> (Chord: (5, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, 14, 10, 0> (Chord: (10, 14))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 18 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [18].
