Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
<5, 9, 18, 13>, <5, 9, 18, 0>, <9, 18, 13, 4>, <9, 5, 6, 16>, <9, 5, 11, 10>, <14, 17, 19, 1>, <8, 14, 17, 19>, <8, 14, 17, 1>, <8, 14, 17, 19>, <8, 14, 17, 1>, <6, 5, 9, 18>, <6, 5, 11, 10>, <6, 16, 12, 4>, <4, 13, 18, 9>, <4, 13, 18, 0>, <1, 4, 6, 5>, <1, 7, 2, 9>, <1, 19, 17, 14>, <2, 9, 18, 13>, <2, 9, 18, 0>

Step 2: 
The only chordal 4-cycle in the graph is <8, 14, 17, 19> with chord (8, 17).

Step 3:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, so the count is [1].
