Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <5, 9, 7, 3>
- <5, 9, 1, 2>
- <5, 9, 7, 4>
- <5, 0, 13, 8>
- <5, 0, 6, 4>
- <5, 3, 12, 0>
- <9, 7, 4, 10>
- <9, 7, 3, 11>
- <9, 1, 11, 4>
- <9, 1, 2, 13>
- <7, 4, 10, 6>
- <8, 13, 2, 1>
- <8, 13, 0, 6>
- <8, 13, 0, 12>
- <8, 11, 3, 12>
- <8, 11, 1, 2>
- <8, 11, 4, 7>
- <8, 6, 10, 4>
- <8, 12, 14, 4>
- <8, 12, 3, 11>
- <8, 12, 0, 5>
- <13, 2, 1, 9>
- <13, 0, 5, 9>
- <13, 0, 6, 4>
- <10, 6, 4, 7>
- <11, 3, 12, 8>
- <11, 1, 9, 5>
- <11, 1, 2, 13>
- <11, 4, 7, 3>
- <3, 12, 0, 5>
- <1, 9, 3, 7>
- <4, 10, 6, 8>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <5, 9, 1, 2>
- <5, 3, 12, 0>
- <9, 1, 11, 4>
- <8, 13, 2, 1>
- <8, 13, 0, 6>
- <8, 11, 3, 12>

Step 3:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
