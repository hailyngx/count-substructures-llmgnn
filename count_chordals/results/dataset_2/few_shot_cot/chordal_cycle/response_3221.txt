Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 9, 4, 1, 7>
<0, 9, 4, 3, 7>
<0, 9, 1, 4, 7>
<1, 4, 7, 3, 0>
<1, 7, 4, 9, 6>
<1, 7, 4, 9, 0>
<1, 7, 4, 3, 0>
<1, 6, 9, 4, 7>
<1, 9, 4, 7, 3>
<2, 4, 7, 3, 0>
<3, 4, 7, 1, 9>
<3, 4, 7, 1, 6>
<3, 0, 9, 6, 1>
<5, 4, 7, 1, 9>
<6, 9, 4, 7, 3>
<6, 1, 4, 7, 3>

Step 2: Checking for the presence of one chord in each cycle:
<1, (6, 9), 7> (Chord: 6-9)
<1, (4, 9), 7> (Chord: 4-9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
