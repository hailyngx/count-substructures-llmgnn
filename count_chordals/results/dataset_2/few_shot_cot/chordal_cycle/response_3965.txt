Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 4, 19, 5>
- <0, 4, 8, 1, 6>
- <0, 4, 8, 18>
- <0, 4, 12, 16>
- <0, 6, 1, 8>
- <1, 6, 0, 17>
- <1, 6, 0, 11>
- <1, 6, 8, 4>
- <1, 8, 18>
- <2, 9, 10, 15>
- <2, 9, 14, 7>
- <3, 15, 7, 13>
- <3, 15, 16, 17>
- <3, 19, 4, 12>
- <3, 19, 2, 9>
- <4, 8, 1, 6>
- <4, 12, 16, 15>
- <4, 19, 2, 9>
- <5, 19, 3, 15>
- <7, 15, 10, 9>
- <7, 15, 16, 12>
- <8, 4, 19, 2>
- <9, 14, 7, 13>
- <9, 12, 16, 17>
- <10, 15, 3, 19>
- <10, 15, 7, 14>
- <11, 0, 17, 13>
- <16, 15, 10, 9>
- <16, 15, 7, 14>
- <17, 1, 6, 0>
- <17, 1, 8, 4>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Found exactly one chord in <0, 4, 19, 5>: Chord is edge (4, 19)
- Found exactly one chord in <1, 6, 0, 11>: Chord is edge (6, 11)
- Found exactly one chord in <1, 6, 8, 4>: Chord is edge (6, 4)
- Found exactly one chord in <3, 19, 2, 9>: Chord is edge (19, 2)
- Found exactly one chord in <9, 14, 7, 13>: Chord is edge (14, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 26 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. Therefore, the final count of chordless cycles is [21].
