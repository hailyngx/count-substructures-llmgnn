Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: <4, 7, 1, 4>
- Cycle 2: <4, 5, 2, 4>
- Cycle 3: <1, 7, 5, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 3, 4, 1>
- Cycle 5: <5, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 6: <5, 2, 1, 5>
- Cycle 7: <5, 8, 3, 5>
- Cycle 8: <6, 1, 4, 6>
- Cycle 9: <0, 3, 1, 0>
- Cycle 10: <0, 6, 5, 0>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (4, 1)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 5)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (7, 5)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (3, 4)
- Cycle 5 is chordal
- Cycle 6 is chordal
- Cycle 7 is chordal
- Cycle 8 has a chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 9 is chordal
- Cycle 10 is chordal

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 5 chordless cycles found: Cycle 5, Cycle 6, Cycle 7, Cycle 9, and Cycle 10

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [5].
