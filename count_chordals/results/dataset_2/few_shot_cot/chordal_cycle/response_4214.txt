The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 9, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 4, 8, 1> (of length 4)
- Cycle <0, 4, 6, 1> (of length 4)
- Cycle <0, 4, 7, 3> (of length 4)
- Cycle <1, 8, 4, 7, 5> (of length 5)
- Cycle <2, 1, 8, 4, 7> (of length 5)
- Cycle <3, 7, 5, 1, 8> (of length 5)
- Cycle <5, 1, 8, 4, 7> (of length 5)
- Cycle <5, 7, 3, 0, 4> (of length 5)
- Cycle <6, 1, 8, 4, 7> (of length 5)
- Cycle <6, 3, 7, 5, 1> (of length 5)
- Cycle <8, 4, 7, 5, 1> (of length 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 4, 8, 1> with chord (4, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 4, 6, 1> with chord (4, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 4, 7, 3> with chord (4, 3)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 8, 4, 7, 5> with chord (8, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, 1, 8, 4, 7> with chord (1, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, 7, 5, 1, 8> with chord (7, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <5, 1, 8, 4, 7> with chord (1, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <5, 7, 3, 0, 4> with chord (7, 0)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, 1, 8, 4, 7> with chord (1, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, 3, 7, 5, 1> with chord (3, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <8, 4, 7, 5, 1> with chord (4, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are [11] chordal 4-cycles found.

Final Result: [11]
