Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 15, 2, 17>
- <0, 2, 5, 19>
- <0, 3, 12, 2>
- <1, 17, 14, 8>
- <1, 9, 8, 11>
- <1, 19, 5, 10>
- <2, 17, 14, 13>
- <2, 12, 9, 8>
- <2, 11, 4, 8>
- <3, 0, 15, 2>
- <3, 12, 9, 1>
- <4, 8, 14, 13>
- <4, 11, 2, 12>
- <5, 10, 7, 18>
- <5, 19, 6, 11>
- <7, 3, 12, 9>
- <7, 10, 5, 2>
- <8, 14, 17, 1>
- <8, 11, 6, 19>
- <9, 8, 15, 0>
- <9, 1, 17, 14>
- <9, 12, 16, 12>
- <11, 6, 19, 1>
- <12, 9, 1, 17>
- <13, 14, 8, 11>

Step 2: Identified chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 17, 14, 8> with chord (1, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 17, 14, 13> with chord (2, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 12, 9, 8> with chord (12, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle <9, 8, 15, 0> with chord (8, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are [20] chordless 4-cycles.
