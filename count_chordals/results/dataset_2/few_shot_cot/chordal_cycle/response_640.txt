Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 19, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 17, 2, 12>
- Cycle 3: <0, 17, 4, 18>
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 14, 7>
- Cycle 6: <1, 14, 2, 17>
- Cycle 7: <2, 17, 4, 18>
- Cycle 8: <3, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle 9: <3, 9, 14, 7>
- Cycle 10: <4, 6, 9, 1>
- Cycle 11: <4, 6, 16, 13>
- Cycle 12: <4, 6, 16, 11>
- Cycle 13: <4, 17, 0, 7>
- Cycle 14: <4, 17, 2, 14>
- Cycle 15: <4, 18, 17, 0>
- Cycle 16: <5, 11, 16, 13>
- Cycle 17: <5, 11, 16, 6>
- Cycle 18: <5, 12, 14, 1>
- Cycle 19: <6, 16, 11, 5>
- Cycle 20: <7, 0, 17, 4>
- Cycle 21: <7, 14, 9, 1>
- Cycle 22: <7, 14, 2, 17>
- Cycle 23: <9, 1, 14, 7>
- Cycle 24: <16, 11, 5, 12>
- Cycle 25: <16, 13, 1, 14>
- Cycle 26: <16, 13, 19, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <0, 17, 2, 12> has a chord (2, 12)
- <1, 9, 6, 4> has a chord (9, 4)
- <1, 14, 2, 17> has a chord (14, 17)
- <3, 9, 14, 7> has a chord (9, 7)
- <4, 6, 9, 1> has a chord (6, 1)
- <4, 6, 16, 11> has a chord (6, 11)
- <4, 17, 2, 14> has a chord (17, 14)
- <5, 12, 14, 1> has a chord (12, 1)
- <9, 1, 14, 7> has a chord (1, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, there are 17 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [17].
