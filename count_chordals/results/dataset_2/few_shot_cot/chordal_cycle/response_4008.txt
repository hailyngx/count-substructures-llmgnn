Response:
Following the steps provided to count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Found 4-cycles: 
    - <0, 9, 5, 12>
    - <0, 9, 5, 13>
    - <0, 9, 5, 10>
    - <1, 7, 4, 12>
    - <1, 7, 4, 13>
    - <2, 7, 4, 12>
    - <2, 7, 4, 13>
    - <3, 7, 4, 12>
    - <3, 7, 4, 13>
    - <4, 7, 12, 3>
    - <5, 9, 6, 13>
    - <5, 13, 6, 9>
    - <6, 9, 5, 13>
    - <6, 13, 5, 9>
    - <7, 4, 13, 6>
    - <7, 6, 13, 4>
    - <8, 10, 13, 4>
    - <8, 10, 4, 7>
    - <10, 13, 6, 9>
    - <13, 6, 9, 5>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 5, 12> has chord (5, 12)
- <0, 9, 5, 13> has chord (5, 13)
- <0, 9, 5, 10> has chord (5, 10)
- <1, 7, 4, 12> has chord (7, 12)
- <1, 7, 4, 13> has chord (7, 13)
- <3, 7, 4, 12> has chord (7, 12)
- <4, 7, 12, 3> has chord (7, 12)
- <5, 9, 6, 13> has chord (9, 6)
- <6, 9, 5, 13> has chord (9, 5)
- <7, 4, 13, 6> has chord (4, 13)
- <8, 10, 13, 4> has chord (10, 13)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 16 chordless 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [16].
