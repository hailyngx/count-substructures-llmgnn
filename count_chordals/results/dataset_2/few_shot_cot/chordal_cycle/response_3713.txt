Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 9, 10>
- <0, 5, 11, 12>
- <0, 5, 6, 3>
- <0, 4, 1, 10>
- <0, 4, 14, 11>
- <1, 4, 14, 11>
- <1, 4, 0, 10>
- <1, 4, 0, 2>
- <1, 12, 7, 13>
- <1, 12, 11, 14>
- <1, 12, 10, 3>
- <1, 10, 0, 2>
- <2, 0, 1, 4>
- <2, 0, 1, 12>
- <2, 0, 10, 3>
- <2, 6, 5, 11>
- <3, 6, 5, 11>
- <3, 6, 11, 12>
- <3, 10, 9, 5>
- <4, 0, 5, 9>
- <4, 0, 10, 2>
- <4, 1, 12, 7>
- <5, 0, 4, 14>
- <5, 6, 3, 10>
- <6, 3, 10, 1>
- <7, 12, 11, 5>
- <8, 13, 7, 12>
- <9, 5, 0, 4>
- <9, 5, 6, 3>
- <10, 9, 5, 6>
- <10, 9, 0, 4>
- <11, 5, 9, 10>
- <11, 6, 3, 10>
- <12, 7, 13, 8>
- <13, 7, 12, 8>
- <14, 11, 12, 7>

Step 2: Check for chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 5, 9, 10> has a chord (5, 10)
- <0, 5, 11, 12> has a chord (5, 12)
- <0, 5, 6, 3> has a chord (5, 3)
- <0, 4, 1, 10> has a chord (4, 10)
- <0, 4, 14, 11> has a chord (4, 11)
- <1, 4, 14, 11> has a chord (4, 11)
- <1, 4, 0, 10> has a chord (4, 10)
- <1, 4, 0, 2> has a chord (4, 2)
- <1, 12, 7, 13> has a chord (12, 13)
- <1, 12, 11, 14> has a chord (12, 14)
- <1, 12, 10, 3> has a chord (12, 3)
- <1, 10, 0, 2> has a chord (10, 2)
- <2, 0, 10, 3> has a chord (0, 3)
- <3, 6, 11, 5> has a chord (6, 5)
- <3, 10, 9, 5> has a chord (10, 9)
- <4, 0, 10, 2> has a chord (0, 2)
  
Step 3: Count the chordless cycles found:
There are 29 chordal 4-cycles found.
So, the number of chordless cycles is [16].
