        <19, 17, 5, 1>
        <19, 17, 9, 16>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

        Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (5, 2), 18)>
        Chordal 4-cycle found: <4, (16, 12), 10)>
        Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, (17, 5), 1)>
        Chordal 4-cycle found: <18, (2, 5), 1)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        Number of chordal 4-cycles = [48]
