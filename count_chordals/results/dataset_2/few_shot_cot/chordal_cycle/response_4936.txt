Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <6, 9, 1, 7, 6>
- Cycle 2: <6, 9, 3, 1, 6>
- Cycle 3: <6, 9, 7, 2, 6>
- Cycle 4: <6, 9, 7, 0, 6>
- Cycle 5: <9, 1, 2, 7, 9>
- Cycle 6: <9, 1, 7, 0, 9>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 5, 2, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 3, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 9: <3, 5, 2, 7, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 5, 8, 2, 3>
- Cycle 11: <0, 4, 8, 5, 0>
- Cycle 12: <0, 7, 2, 1, 0>
- Cycle 13: <0, 7, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle 14: <7, 6, 8, 4, 7>
- Cycle 15: <7, 6, 3, 1, 7>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chords: (6, 1)
- Cycle 2 has chords: (6, 1)
- Cycle 3 has chords: (6, 2)
- Cycle 4 has chords: (6, 2)
- Cycle 5 has chords: (9, 2)
- Cycle 6 has chords: (9, 2)
- Cycle 7 has chords: (1, 2)
- Cycle 8 has chords: (1, 8)
- Cycle 9 has chords: (3, 7)
- Cycle 10 has chords: (3, 7)
- Cycle 11 has chords: (0, 5)
- Cycle 12 has chords: (0, 1)
- Cycle 13 has chords: (0, 9)
- Cycle 14 has chords: (7, 8)
- Cycle 15 has chords: (7, 1)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 0 chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
