Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph

- The possible 4-cycles in the graph are:
1. <3, 4, 7, 9>
2. <0, 3, 4, 7>
3. <6, 4, 7, 1>
4. <5, 6, 4, 7>
5. <3, 5, 6, 4>
6. <0, 5, 6, 4>
7. <8, 4, 7, 1>
8. <3, 8, 4, 7>
9. <0, 8, 4, 7>
10. <8, 4, 7, 9>
11. <12, 8, 4, 7>
12. <3, 5, 13, 1>
13. <0, 5, 13, 1>
14. <5, 6, 13, 1>
15. <5, 14, 13, 1>
16. <7, 1, 13, 5>
17. <7, 4, 3, 5>
18. <9, 7, 4, 3>
19. <12, 8, 4, 3>
20. <12, 11, 6, 5>
21. <12, 9, 8, 4>
22. <12, 14, 13, 5>
23. <12, 9, 1, 13>
24. <12, 3, 0, 5>
25. <12, 14, 2, 7>
26. <12, 14, 2, 6>
27. <12, 14, 2, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord

- The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) in the graph are:
1. <3, 4, 7, 9>, chord: (4, 9)
2. <0, 3, 4, 7>, chord: (0, 7)
3. <5, 6, 4, 7>, chord: (6, 7)
4. <3, 5, 6, 4>, chord: (3, 6)
5. <8, 4, 7, 1>, chord: (4, 1)
6. <0, 8, 4, 7>, chord: (8, 7)
7. <5, 14, 13, 1>, chord: (14, 1)
8. <12, 9, 1, 13>, chord: (9, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles

- There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
