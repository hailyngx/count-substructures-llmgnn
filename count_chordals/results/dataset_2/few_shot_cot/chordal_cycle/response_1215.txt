Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 2, 6, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 7, 1, 8, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 4, 3, 6, 0>

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 2 has chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 3 has chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 4 has chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 5 has chord (3, 6)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
Since all cycles have exactly one chord, there are no chordless cycles found.

Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
