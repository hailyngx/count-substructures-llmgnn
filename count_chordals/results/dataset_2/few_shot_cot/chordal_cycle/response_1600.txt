Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (6, 13, 4, 9, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 13, 11, 5, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 13, 10, 7, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 10, 1, 8, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 10, 11, 5, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 11, 3, 14, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 11, 5, 8, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 11, 3, 2, 6)
- Cycle 9: (9, 4, 13, 10, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 4, 14, 12, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 4, 13, 6, 9)
- Cycle 12: (9, 4, 14, 3, 9)
- Cycle 13: (9, 11, 3, 14, 9)
- Cycle 14: (9, 11, 5, 8, 9)
- Cycle 15: (9, 11, 3, 2, 9)
- Cycle 16: (9, 11, 5, 6, 9)
- Cycle 17: (0, 6, 13, 4, 0)
- Cycle 18: (0, 6, 13, 10, 0)
- Cycle 19: (0, 6, 11, 5, 0)
- Cycle 20: (0, 6, 11, 3, 0)
- Cycle 21: (0, 2, 3, 14, 0)
- Cycle 22: (0, 2, 6, 13, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Chordal 4-cycle 1 (<6, 13, 11, 5>): Chord (6, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2 (<6, 10, 1, 8>): Chord (6, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3 (<6, 11, 3, 14>): Chord (6, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4 (<9, 4, 13, 10>): Chord (9, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5 (<9, 4, 14, 12>): Chord (9, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6 (<9, 11, 3, 14>): Chord (9, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7 (<0, 6, 13, 10>): Chord (0, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
