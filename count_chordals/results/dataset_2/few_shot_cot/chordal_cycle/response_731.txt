Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph. We will list them below:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 12, 4>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 10, 8>
- Cycle 3: <5, 13, 3, 2>
- Cycle 4: <5, 13, 14, 6>
- Cycle 5: <9, 12, 0, 11>
- Cycle 6: <9, 10, 2, 4>
- Cycle 7: <9, 11, 0, 12>
- Cycle 8: <12, 4, 1, 13>
- Cycle 9: <12, 0, 14, 13>
- Cycle 10: <4, 2, 3, 6>
- Cycle 11: <4, 1, 13, 5>
- Cycle 12: <2, 3, 6, 14>
- Cycle 13: <2, 10, 8, 13>
- Cycle 14: <3, 7, 8, 13>
- Cycle 15: <6, 5, 13, 3>
- Cycle 16: <6, 14, 0, 12>
- Cycle 17: <0, 10, 3, 13>
- Cycle 18: <0, 11, 9, 5>

Step 2: 
Identifying the cycles with exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 12, 4> has exactly one chord (5, 12)
- <5, 13, 14, 6> has exactly one chord (5, 14)
- <9, 10, 2, 4> has exactly one chord (9, 2)
- <9, 11, 0, 12> has exactly one chord (9, 12)
- <12, 4, 1, 13> has exactly one chord (12, 13)
- <2, 10, 8, 13> has exactly one chord (2, 8)
- <3, 7, 8, 13> has exactly one chord (3, 8)
- <6, 14, 0, 12> has exactly one chord (6, 12)

Step 3: 
Count the number of chordal cycles found: [8]

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<5, 9, 12, 4>, <5, 13, 14, 6>, <9, 10, 2, 4>, <9, 11, 0, 12>, <12, 4, 1, 13>, <2, 10, 8, 13>, <3, 7, 8, 13>, <6, 14, 0, 12>
