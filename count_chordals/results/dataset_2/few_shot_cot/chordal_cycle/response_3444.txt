Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 4, 9>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 4, 7>
- Cycle 3: <0, 2, 6, 9>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 6, 7>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 6: <2, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 7, 9>
- Cycle 8: <2, 6, 5, 1>
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 6, 9>
- Cycle 10: <4, 7, 2, 8>
- Cycle 11: <5, 6, 9, 8>
- Cycle 12: <5, 7, 6, 2>
- Cycle 13: <5, 7, 4, 9>
- Cycle 14: <8, 9, 4, 7>
- Cycle 15: <8, 9, 6, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <2, 5, 8, 9> has a chord: (2, 8)
- <2, 6, 7, 9> has a chord: (2, 7)
- <5, 6, 9, 8> has a chord: (5, 8)
- <1, 5, 8, 9> has a chord: (1, 8)
- <4, 7, 6, 9> has a chord: (4, 6)
- <5, 7, 6, 2> has a chord: (5, 6)
- <8, 9, 4, 7> has a chord: (8, 4)
- <2, 6, 5, 1> has a chord: (2, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- The chordless cycles are: <0, 3, 4, 9>, <0, 3, 4, 7>, <0, 2, 6, 9>, <1, 5, 6, 7>.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycle in the graph is [4].
