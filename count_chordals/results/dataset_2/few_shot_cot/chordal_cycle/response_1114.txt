Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 1, 3, 8, 0>
<0, 1, 5, 12, 0>
<0, 12, 9, 6, 0>
<1, 3, 10, 13, 1>
<1, 5, 7, 8, 1>
<2, 6, 4, 2>
<2, 6, 9, 13, 2>
<2, 7, 8, 14, 2>
<2, 10, 14, 13, 2>
<3, 8, 14, 10, 3>
<4, 6, 9, 13, 4>
<5, 6, 2, 14, 5>
<5, 7, 12, 9, 5>
<8, 7, 12, 9, 8>
<8, 13, 14, 10, 8>
<9, 13, 10, 2, 9>
<11, 13, 10, 14, 11>
<12, 9, 6, 4, 12>

Step 2: Identify the cycles with exactly one chord:
There are no cycles of length 4 with exactly one chord present in the graph.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 17 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [17].
