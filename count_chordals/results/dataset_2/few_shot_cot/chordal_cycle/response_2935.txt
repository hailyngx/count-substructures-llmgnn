Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1:  
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

1. <5, 9, 4, 1>
2. <5, 9, 4, 3>
3. <5, 9, 2, 1>
4. <5, 9, 2, 8>
5. <5, 9, 8, 1>
6. <5, 9, 8, 6>
7. <9, 4, 1, 8>
8. <9, 4, 3, 7>
9. <9, 4, 3, 6>
10. <9, 4, 3, 5>
11. <9, 1, 8, 6>
12. <9, 1, 8, 2>
13. <9, 2, 8, 6>
14. <9, 2, 8, 1>
15. <9, 2, 1, 4>
16. <9, 2, 1, 8>
17. <9, 7, 0, 6>
18. <9, 7, 0, 5>
19. <4, 1, 8, 6>
20. <4, 3, 7, 0>
21. <4, 3, 6, 9>
22. <4, 3, 5, 9>
23. <7, 0, 5, 9>
24. <7, 3, 4, 9>
25. <1, 8, 9, 2>
26. <1, 8, 9, 6>
27. <2, 8, 9, 6>
28. <2, 8, 9, 1>
29. <2, 1, 4, 9>
30. <2, 1, 8, 9>
31. <7, 0, 6, 9>
32. <3, 5, 9, 4>
33. <3, 5, 9, 2>
34. <3, 4, 1, 9>
35. <3, 4, 9, 6>
36. <3, 7, 9, 4>
37. <6, 9, 8, 1>
38. <6, 9, 8, 2>
39. <0, 5, 9, 4>
40. <0, 5, 9, 2>

Step 2:  
Out of these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <5, 9, 2, 1> with the chord (9, 4).

Step 3:  
So, the number of chordless cycles found is [0].
