Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<0, 4, 19, 3>, <0, 4, 2, 3>, <0, 4, 19, 5>, <0, 16, 9, 10>, <0, 17, 18, 6>, <0, 17, 8, 13>, <0, 17, 9, 10>, <0, 11, 2, 3>, <0, 11, 12, 10>, <1, 15, 5, 19>, <2, 4, 19, 5>, <2, 4, 19, 10>, <2, 3, 6, 18>, <2, 3, 13, 8>, <2, 11, 0, 16>, <2, 11, 12, 10>, <3, 19, 5, 7>, <3, 19, 10, 12>, <4, 19, 5, 7>, <4, 19, 10, 12>, <6, 18, 17, 8>, <6, 18, 7, 5>, <6, 14, 17, 8>, <7, 5, 15, 1>, <7, 5, 19, 10>, <7, 18, 17, 0>, <8, 13, 11, 2>, <8, 13, 3, 19>, <8, 17, 0, 16>, <8, 17, 6, 18>, <8, 17, 9, 10>, <9, 16, 0, 11>, <9, 16, 0, 17>, <9, 17, 18, 6>, <11, 12, 10, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<0, 4, 19, 3> - Chord: (4, 19) 
<0, 4, 2, 3> - Chord: (4, 2) 
<0, 4, 19, 5> - Chord: (4, 19) 
<0, 16, 9, 10> - Chord: (16, 9) 
<0, 17, 18, 6> - Chord: (17, 18) 
<0, 17, 8, 13> - Chord: (8, 13) 
<0, 17, 9, 10> - Chord: (9, 10) 
<0, 11, 2, 3> - Chord: (2, 3) 
<0, 11, 12, 10> - Chord: (11, 10) 
<1, 15, 5, 19> - Chord: (15, 19) 
<2, 4, 19, 5> - Chord: (4, 5) 
<2, 4, 19, 10> - Chord: (4, 10) 
<2, 3, 6, 18> - Chord: (3, 6) 
<2, 3, 13, 8> - Chord: (3, 8) 
<2, 11, 0, 16> - Chord: (11, 0) 
<2, 11, 12, 10> - Chord: (11, 12) 
<3, 19, 5, 7> - Chord: (5, 7) 
<3, 19, 10, 12> - Chord: (10, 12) 
<4, 19, 5, 7> - Chord: (19, 5) 
<4, 19, 10, 12> - Chord: (19, 12) 
<6, 18, 17, 8> - Chord: (18, 17) 
<6, 18, 7, 5> - Chord: (18, 7) 
<6, 14, 17, 8> - Chord: (14, 17) 
<7, 5, 15, 1> - Chord: (5, 15) 
<7, 5, 19, 10> - Chord: (5, 10) 
<7, 18, 17, 0> - Chord: (17, 0) 
<8, 13, 11, 2> - Chord: (13, 11) 
<8, 13, 3, 19> - Chord: (13, 19) 
<8, 17, 0, 16> - Chord: (17, 16) 
<8, 17, 6, 18> - Chord: (17, 6) 
<8, 17, 9, 10> - Chord: (17, 9) 
<9, 16, 0, 11> - Chord: (16, 11) 
<9, 16, 0, 17> - Chord: (16, 17) 
<9, 17, 18, 6> - Chord: (17, 18) 
<11, 12, 10, 19> - Chord: (12, 19) 

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        
There are [33] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
