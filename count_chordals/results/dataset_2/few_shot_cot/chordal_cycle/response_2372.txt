Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 6, 1, 4, 0>
2. <1, 6, 9, 3, 1>
3. <1, 6, 9, 7, 1>
4. <1, 6, 2, 7, 1>
5. <2, 6, 1, 7, 2>
6. <2, 6, 4, 8, 2>
7. <3, 9, 7, 8, 3>
8. <4, 8, 6, 0, 4>
9. <5, 6, 1, 7, 5>
10. <6, 8, 4, 2, 6>
11. <7, 9, 3, 5, 7>
12. <8, 4, 2, 6, 8>
13. <9, 3, 5, 0, 9>

Step 2:
The cycles that have exactly one chord are:
1. <1, 6, 9, 7, 1> (Chord: (6, 9))
2. <2, 6, 1, 7, 2> (Chord: (6, 1))
3. <3, 9, 7, 8, 3> (Chord: (9, 7))
4. <5, 6, 1, 7, 5> (Chord: (6, 1))

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [9].
