Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 5, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 14, 5>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 5, 11>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 10, 2>
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 13, 11>
- Cycle 7: <2, 7, 9, 10>
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 11, 12>
- Cycle 9: <3, 8, 13, 1>
- Cycle 10: <4, 5, 12, 11>
- Cycle 11: <7, 2, 10, 6>
- Cycle 12: <7, 4, 8, 13>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycle is:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 6, 7, 4> with chord (1, 4)

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
