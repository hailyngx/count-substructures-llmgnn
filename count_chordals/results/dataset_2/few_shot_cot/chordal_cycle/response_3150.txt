Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has no chord.
- Cycle 8 has no chord.
- Cycle 9 has chord <2, (0, 7)>.
- Cycle 10 has no chord.
- Cycle 11 has chord <2, (3, 11)>.
- Cycle 12 has no chord.
- Cycle 13 has no chord.
- Cycle 14 has no chord.
- Cycle 15 has chord <5, (6, 9)>.
- Cycle 16 has no chord.
- Cycle 17 has no chord.
- Cycle 18 has chord <5, (11, 12)>.
- Cycle 19 has no chord.
- Cycle 20 has no chord.
- Cycle 21 has chord <9, (5, 12)>.
- Cycle 22 has no chord.
- Cycle 23 has no chord.
- Cycle 24 has no chord.
- Cycle 25 has chord <11, (3, 14)>.
- Cycle 26 has no chord.
- Cycle 27 has chord <12, (5, 9)>.
- Cycle 28 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 21 chordless cycles found.

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us the answer: [21].
