Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 13) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 13) (1, 12) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 12) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 13) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 14) (13, 7) (13, 11) (13, 3) (13, 14)

Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 10, 2, 0, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 10, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 11, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 10, 0, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 11, 3, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 0, 12, and node 13

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <5, 6, 11, 13> with a chord between nodes 6 and 11. 

There are no other chordal 4-cycles in the graph. Therefore, the final count is [1].
