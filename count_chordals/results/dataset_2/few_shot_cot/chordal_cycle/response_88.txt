Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 17, 6, 4, 12>
- Cycle 2: <0, 17, 14, 15, 5>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 16, 2, 3>
- Cycle 4: <1, 8, 2, 16, 5>
- Cycle 5: <1, 8, 0, 17, 14>
- Cycle 6: <1, 12, 8, 2, 16>
- Cycle 7: <1, 10, 19, 3, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 8, 12, 4, 6>
- Cycle 9: <3, 9, 3, 19, 11>
- Cycle 10: <5, 14, 17, 13, 17>
- Cycle 11: <5, 15, 14, 17, 0>
- Cycle 12: <6, 17, 14, 18, 16>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (6, 12)
- Cycle 2 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 3 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 4 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord (0, 14)
- Cycle 6 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 7 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord (6, 12)
- Cycle 9 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 10 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 11 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 12 has exactly one chord (14, 16)

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: [3]
