Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
<3, 15, 0, 3>
<3, 15, 14, 10, 12, 5, 3>
<3, 15, 14, 17, 8, 2, 0, 3>
<3, 15, 14, 17, 5, 12, 10, 6, 7, 3>
<3, 15, 14, 10, 6, 7, 13, 11, 16, 12, 10, 14, 15, 3>
<3, 15, 14, 17, 5, 12, 10, 6, 4, 12, 16, 11, 13, 7, 6, 10, 14, 17, 15, 3>
<0, 3, 15, 14, 17, 8, 2, 0>
<0, 3, 15, 14, 17, 5, 12, 10, 6, 7, 13, 11, 16, 12, 10, 14, 17, 8, 2, 0>
<0, 3, 15, 14, 10, 12, 5, 17, 8, 2, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<3, 15, 14, 10, 12, 5, 3> - Chord: (10, 14)
<3, 15, 14, 17, 8, 2, 0, 3> - Chord: (17, 8)
<3, 15, 14, 17, 5, 12, 10, 6, 7, 3> - Chord: (14, 17)
<3, 15, 14, 10, 6, 7, 13, 11, 16, 12, 10, 14, 15, 3> - Chord: (7, 13)
<3, 15, 14, 17, 5, 12, 10, 6, 4, 12, 16, 11, 13, 7, 6, 10, 14, 17, 15, 3> - Chord: (4, 16)
<0, 3, 15, 14, 17, 8, 2, 0> - Chord: (14, 17)
<0, 3, 15, 14, 17, 5, 12, 10, 6, 7, 13, 11, 16, 12, 10, 14, 17, 8, 2, 0> - Chord: (7, 13)
<0, 3, 15, 14, 10, 12, 5, 17, 8, 2, 0> - Chord: (5, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
Based on the above analysis, there are [0] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
