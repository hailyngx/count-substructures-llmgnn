- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (7, 5)
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (7, 12)
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (7, 3)
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord: (12, 9)
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord: (12, 10)
- Cycle 9 has exactly one chord: (10, 12)
- Cycle 10 has exactly one chord: (10, 8)
- Cycle 11 has exactly one chord: (6, 11)
- Cycle 12 has exactly one chord: (7, 12)
- Cycle 13 has exactly one chord: (7, 14)
