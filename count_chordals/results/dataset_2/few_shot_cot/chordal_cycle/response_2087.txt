Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- <0, 9, 8, 2, 13>
- <0, 9, 11, 18, 3>
- <0, 9, 11, 18, 4>
- <0, 9, 11, 18, 7>
- <0, 9, 14, 9>
- <0, 9, 19, 0>
- <0, 10, 13, 7>
- <1, 3, 18, 5>
- <1, 12, 0, 10>
- <1, 12, 15, 5>
- <1, 16, 6, 1>
- <2, 8, 4, 18>
- <2, 8, 9, 0>
- <3, 1, 6, 16>
- <4, 18, 7, 17>
- <5, 15, 12, 0>
- <9, 8, 4, 18>
- <9, 8, 9, 19>
- <9, 8, 2, 13>
- <9, 0, 19, 0>
- <9, 11, 18, 7>
- <9, 11, 18, 3>
- <9, 11, 18, 4>
- <9, 14, 9, 8>
- <10, 0, 19, 9>
- <10, 0, 12, 15>
- <10, 0, 13, 7>
- <11, 18, 7, 17>
- <12, 0, 19, 9>
- <13, 2, 8, 9>
- <13, 0, 19, 9>
- <15, 18, 7, 17>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, 8, 2, 13> (Chord: (2, 8))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- There is 0 chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
