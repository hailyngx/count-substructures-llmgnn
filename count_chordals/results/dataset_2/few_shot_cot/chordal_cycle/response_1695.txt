Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 3, 6, 4, 0>
- <0, 3, 6, 8, 1, 7, 4, 0>
- <0, 3, 2, 1, 7, 4, 0>
- <0, 3, 9, 5, 4, 0>
- <1, 7, 4, 5, 9, 2, 1>
- <1, 7, 4, 6, 5, 9, 2, 1>
- <2, 1, 7, 4, 5, 9, 2>
- <2, 1, 7, 4, 6, 5, 9, 2>
- <3, 0, 5, 9, 8, 6, 3>
- <3, 6, 4, 7, 9, 8, 2, 3>
- <4, 5, 9, 8, 7, 4>
- <6, 4, 7, 9, 8, 6>
- <7, 9, 2, 1, 8, 7>
- <8, 9, 2, 1, 7, 8>
- <8, 6, 4, 7, 9, 8>

Step 2: Checking for a unique chord in each cycle:
- Chordal cycle found: <1, 7, (4, 5), 9, 2, 1>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are no chordless cycles found.

Final answer: [1]
