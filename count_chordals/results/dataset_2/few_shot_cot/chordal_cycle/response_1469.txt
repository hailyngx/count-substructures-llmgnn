Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 12, 7, 2, 0, 4, 17, 12)
- Cycle 2: (5, 12, 17, 8, 18, 11, 10, 6)
- Cycle 3: (5, 12, 17, 8, 15, 13, 10, 6)
- Cycle 4: (12, 17, 8, 18, 11, 10, 6, 12)
- Cycle 5: (12, 17, 8, 15, 13, 10, 6, 12)
- Cycle 6: (12, 17, 4, 0, 2, 7, 3, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (13, 6), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- There is 0 chordless 4-cycle in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
