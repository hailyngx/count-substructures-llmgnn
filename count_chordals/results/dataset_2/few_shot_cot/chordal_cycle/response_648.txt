Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <0, 5, 13, 4, 8, 11>
        - Cycle 2: <0, 10, 11, 8, 4, 13>
        - Cycle 3: <0, 3, 16, 19, 9, 6>
        - Cycle 4: <0, 12, 17, 14, 11, 8>
        - Cycle 5: <1, 12, 13, 5, 0, 17>
        - Cycle 6: <2, 11, 14, 17, 1, 12>
        - Cycle 7: <4, 13, 5, 0, 17, 12>
        - Cycle 8: <6, 9, 19, 18, 6>
        - Cycle 9: <6, 7, 10, 0, 5, 13>
        - Cycle 10: <6, 16, 3, 0, 17, 12>
        - Cycle 11: <6, 18, 19, 8, 11, 14>
        - Cycle 12: <8, 19, 18, 6, 16, 3>
        - Cycle 13: <8, 11, 10, 7, 6, 16>
        - Cycle 14: <9, 19, 8, 4, 13, 5>
        - Cycle 15: <14, 11, 10, 7, 6, 18>
        - Cycle 16: <14, 17, 1, 12, 0, 3>
        - Cycle 17: <16, 6, 9, 19, 8, 4>
        - Cycle 18: <17, 14, 11, 8, 4, 13>
        - Cycle 19: <17, 15, 17, 14, 11, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, 18, 19, 8, 11>
        - Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, 16, 3, 0, 17, 12>
        - Chordal 4-cycle found: <8, 19, 18, 6, 16, 3>
        - Chordal 4-cycle found: <8, 11, 10, 7, 6, 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 15 chordless cycles.
        
Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
