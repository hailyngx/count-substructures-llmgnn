Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 10, 13> with no chords
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 6, 7, 12> with no chords
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 6, 12, 3> with no chords
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 7, 11, 14> with no chords
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 6, 7, 13> with no chords
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 10, 11, 14> with no chords
- Cycle 7: <1, 10, 11, 7, 13> with no chords
- Cycle 8: <2, 9, 12, 6, 5> with no chords
- Cycle 9: <2, 9, 12, 7, 11> with no chords
- Cycle 10: <2, 11, 14, 4, 3> with no chords
- Cycle 11: <2, 11, 14, 13, 10> with no chords
- Cycle 12: <3, 2, 9, 12, 0> with no chords
- Cycle 13: <3, 2, 11, 14, 13> with no chords
- Cycle 14: <4, 14, 11, 7, 8> with no chords

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: <0, 5, (1, 14), 10, 13>
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: <0, 5, (6, 7), 12>
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: <0, 5, (6, 8), 12, 3>
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: <0, 6, (7, 8), 12, 3>
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: <1, 5, (6, 7), 13>
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: <1, 5, 10, (11, 7), 13>
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: <1, 10, (11, 7), 13>
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: <2, 9, 12, (7, 5), 6>
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: <2, 11, (14, 13), 10>
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: <2, 11, 14, (4, 3)>
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: <2, 11, 14, (13, 10)>
- Cycle 12 has 1 chord: <3, 2, 9, (12, 0)>
- Cycle 13 has 1 chord: <3, 2, 11, 14, (13, 10)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [12].
