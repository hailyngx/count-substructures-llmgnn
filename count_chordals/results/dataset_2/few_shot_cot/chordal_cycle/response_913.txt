Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:  
- <0, 11, 13, 14>  
- <1, 12, 8, 2>  
- <3, 2, 4, 1>  
- <4, 6, 5, 8>  
- <7, 10, 9, 14>  
- <8, 2, 3, 12>  
- <9, 12, 5, 6>  
- <11, 7, 9, 10>  
- <13, 11, 14, 3>  
- <14, 9, 4, 13>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 11, 13, 14> has chord (11, 14)  
- <1, 12, 8, 2> has chord (1, 8)  
- <3, 2, 4, 1> has chord (2, 1)  
- <4, 6, 5, 8> has chord (6, 5)  
- <7, 10, 9, 14> has chord (9, 14)  
- <8, 2, 3, 12> has chord (2, 12)  
- <9, 12, 5, 6> has chord (12, 5)  
- <11, 7, 9, 10> has chord (7, 9)  
- <13, 11, 14, 3> has chord (11, 14)  
- <14, 9, 4, 13> has chord (9, 4)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:  
There are a total of [10] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
