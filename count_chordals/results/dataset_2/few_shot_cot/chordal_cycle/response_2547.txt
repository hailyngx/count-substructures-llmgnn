Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
There are a total of 16 cycles of length 4 in this graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 7, 5, 2)
- Cycle 2: (0, 7, 4, 1)
- Cycle 3: (0, 7, 8, 5)
- Cycle 4: (0, 7, 8, 9)
- Cycle 5: (0, 7, 2, 3)
- Cycle 6: (0, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 7: (0, 7, 6, 3)
- Cycle 8: (1, 4, 7, 8)
- Cycle 9: (1, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 10: (1, 3, 9, 8)
- Cycle 11: (1, 3, 9, 0)
- Cycle 12: (3, 1, 4, 7)
- Cycle 13: (3, 1, 9, 8)
- Cycle 14: (3, 1, 9, 0)
- Cycle 15: (8, 7, 4, 1)
- Cycle 16: (8, 7, 5, 3)

Step 2:
From the 16 cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <0, 2, 7, 5>  with chord (0, 5)

Step 3:
Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
