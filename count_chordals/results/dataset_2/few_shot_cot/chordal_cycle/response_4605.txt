Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 7, 1, 9)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 1, 7)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 6, 3)
- Cycle 4: (2, 3, 5, 4)
- Cycle 5: (2, 3, 6, 9)
- Cycle 6: (4, 6, 0, 7)
- Cycle 7: (4, 6, 3, 5)
- Cycle 8: (0, 4, 5, 3)
- Cycle 9: (0, 4, 6, 9)
- Cycle 10: (0, 7, 1, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for a chord:
From the list of cycles, we find that Cycle 5: (2, 3, 6, 9) has one chord (6, 3).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [9] chordless cycles in the graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <5, (2, 3), 6>
