Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph, such as <0, 5, 1, 7>, <0, 5, 1, 3>, <0, 5, 8, 4>, <0, 5, 8, 2>, <1, 5, 8, 9>, <1, 5, 3, 9>, <1, 7, 6, 2>, <3, 5, 8, 9>, <4, 9, 8, 5>, <4, 9, 2, 6>.
  
Step 2: 
- Among these cycles, the cycle <0, 5, 1, 3> has exactly one chord (2-6), making it a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, 1, 3>. 
  
Step 3: 
- There is only one chordal 4-cycle found, so the final answer is [1].
