Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <4, 1, 6, 9>. 

There are no additional chords that can be added to this cycle without breaking the chordal property of having exactly one chord. 

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [(1)].
