Response:
Step 1: 
- There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph, some of them are:
1. <0, 2, 4, 14> 
2. <0, 2, 18, 10> 
3. <0, 18, 19, 11> 
4. <0, 7, 15, 10> 
5. <2, 4, 14, 6> 
6. <2, 18, 10, 15> 
7. <2, 19, 6, 14> 
8. <6, 7, 15, 10> 
9. <6, 14, 4, 2> 
10. <7, 15, 10, 18>
(There are more cycles available)

Step 2:
- After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find that there are multiple unique chordal 4-cycles, some of them are:
1. <0, 2, 4, 14> (Chord: (2, 4)) 
2. <0, 2, 18, 10> (Chord: (2, 18)) 
3. <0, 18, 19, 11> (Chord: (18, 19)) 
4. <0, 7, 15, 10> (Chord: (7, 15)) 
5. <6, 7, 15, 10> (Chord: (7, 15)) 
6. <6, 14, 4, 2> (Chord: (2, 4)) 
7. <7, 15, 10, 18> (Chord: (10, 18))
(There are more chordal 4-cycles available)

Step 3:
- After counting the number of chordless cycles found, the final count is [7].
