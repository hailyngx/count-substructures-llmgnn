Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 12, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 10, 11, 13, 12, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 11, 13, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 10, 8, 12, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 14, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 11, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 12, 7, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 14, 1, 6, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 10, 7, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 2, 14, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 11, 8, 13, 2, 0, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 13, 2>  
- Cycle 2: <1, 11, 6, 13>  
- Cycle 3: <1, 11, 9, 8>  
- Cycle 4: <1, 11, 9, 5>  
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 10, 7>  
- Cycle 6: <2, 13, 4, 11>  
- Cycle 7: <3, 5, 9, 11>  
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 9, 8>  
- Cycle 9: <3, 6, 13, 4>  
- Cycle 10: <3, 6, 13, 2>  
- Cycle 11: <4, 10, 12, 7>  
- Cycle 12: <6, 11, 9, 5>  

Step 2: Identify chordal 4-cycles:

- Cycle 3: <1, 11, 9, 8> (Chord: (9, 8))  
- Cycle 6: <2, 13, 4, 11> (Chord: (13, 11))  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 10 chordless 4-cycles, so the final count is [10].
