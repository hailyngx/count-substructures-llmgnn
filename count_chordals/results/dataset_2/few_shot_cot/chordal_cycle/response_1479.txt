Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (10, 14), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (14, 10), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (14, 19), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (5, 4), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (1, 7), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (5, 7), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <14, (1, 7), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <15, (3, 10), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <16, (8, 1), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <16, (19, 14), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <17, (14, 19), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <18, (9, 13), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <19, (14, 17), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final number is [13].
