Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles with a length of 4 or more are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 1 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 4 - 8 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 3: 1 - 5 - 9 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 6 - 2 - 7 - 1

Step 2:
- Checking for exactly one chord in the cycles:
    - There is no cycle with exactly one chord.

Step 3:
Since there are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, the final count is [0].
