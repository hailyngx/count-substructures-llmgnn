Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <3, 15, 10, 6>
- <3, 15, 19, 6>
- <3, 17, 10, 6>
- <3, 17, 18, 11>
- <3, 7, 2, 12>
- <3, 7, 0, 16>
- <15, 10, 6, 8>
- <15, 19, 6, 10>
- <15, 19, 18, 17>
- <15, 0, 16, 18>
- <10, 17, 18, 11>
- <3, 15, 6, 19>
- <3, 17, 18, 4>
- <3, 17, 10, 15>
- <15, 0, 9, 5>
- <15, 19, 18, 16>
- <15, 19, 3, 17>
- <15, 6, 8, 11>
- <15, 10, 17, 18>
- <7, 0, 16, 18>
- <7, 9, 5, 11>
- <16, 0, 15, 3>
- <16, 18, 4, 3>
- <17, 3, 15, 10>
- <17, 10, 6, 15>
- <18, 4, 3, 7>
- <18, 4, 17, 10>
- <18, 19, 15, 3>
- <18, 11, 8, 6>
- <18, 16, 0, 15>
- <18, 16, 0, 9>
- <19, 3, 7, 2>
- <19, 3, 17, 10>
- <19, 15, 6, 10>
- <19, 18, 11, 5>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <3, 15, 10, 6, (19, 0)>
- <3, 17, 10, 6, (18, 11)>
- <3, 7, 2, 12, (14, 13)>

Step 3:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord, so the final count is [3].
