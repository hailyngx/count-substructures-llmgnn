Step 2:
Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycle 0: <0, (5, 13), 19, 15, 17>
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (2, 8), 13, 5, 6>
- Chordal cycle 2: <2, (6, 5), 18, 14, 4>
- Chordal cycle 3: <5, (6, 2), 8, 12, 16>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [34]

Please note that the numbering of the cycles is for reference only and may vary based on the order of identification.
