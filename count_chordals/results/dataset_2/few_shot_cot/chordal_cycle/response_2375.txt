The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 9, 5, 4, 0>
2. <0, 9, 5, 7, 0>
3. <0, 9, 5, 8, 0>
4. <0, 4, 5, 7, 0>
5. <0, 4, 5, 9, 0>
6. <0, 6, 7, 5, 0>
7. <0, 6, 7, 4, 0>
8. <0, 6, 2, 4, 0>
9. <0, 6, 2, 6, 0>
10. <0, 2, 4, 5, 0>
11. <0, 2, 4, 7, 0>
12. <0, 2, 6, 7, 0>
13. <1, 4, 5, 7, 1>
14. <1, 4, 5, 9, 1>
15. <2, 4, 5, 7, 2>
16. <3, 9, 5, 8, 3>
17. <3, 9, 5, 7, 3>
18. <3, 9, 5, 4, 3>
19. <3, 6, 7, 5, 3>
20. <4, 5, 9, 8, 4>
21. <4, 5, 7, 9, 4>
22. <4, 5, 7, 6, 4>
23. <5, 9, 8, 5, 7>
24. <5, 9, 8, 3, 5>

27. <6, 7, 5, 4, 6>
28. <7, 5, 9, 8, 7>
29. <7, 5, 4, 0, 7>
30. <7, 6, 2, 0, 7>
31. <8, 5, 9, 7, 8>
32. <8, 5, 9, 3, 8>
33. <9, 5, 7, 6, 9>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<0, 9, 5, 8, 0>
Chord: (5, 8)

Step 3:
Number of chordless 4-cycles: [32]
