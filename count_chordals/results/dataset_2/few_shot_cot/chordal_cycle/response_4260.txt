Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle with nodes: 0-5-4-9-2-0
- Cycle with nodes: 0-5-7-9-4-0
- Cycle with nodes: 1-3-4-5-0-1
- Cycle with nodes: 1-3-4-9-7-1
- Cycle with nodes: 1-3-8-4-9-1
- Cycle with nodes: 1-6-8-4-3-1
- Cycle with nodes: 2-9-4-5-7-2
- Cycle with nodes: 2-9-7-3-1-2
- Cycle with nodes: 2-9-7-8-3-2
- Cycle with nodes: 2-6-8-3-1-2
- Cycle with nodes: 3-1-6-8-4-3
- Cycle with nodes: 3-4-8-2-9-3
- Cycle with nodes: 4-5-7-8-3-4
- Cycle with nodes: 4-8-6-2-9-4
- Cycle with nodes: 7-5-4-3-8-7

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle <1, 3, 4, 8, (2, 9), 1>
- Cycle <1, 3, 8, (4, 9), 1>
- Cycle <1, 6, 8, (4, 3), 1>
- Cycle <2, 9, 7, (3, 1), 2>
- Cycle <2, 9, 7, (8, 3), 2>
- Cycle <2, 6, 8, (3, 1), 2>
- Cycle <3, 8, 4, (5, 9), 3>
- Cycle <4, 8, 6, (2, 9), 4>

Step 3:
Final count: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 3, 4, 8, (2, 9), 1>
- <1, 3, 8, (4, 9), 1>
- <1, 6, 8, (4, 3), 1>
- <2, 9, 7, (3, 1), 2>
- <2, 9, 7, (8, 3), 2>
- <2, 6, 8, (3, 1), 2>
- <3, 8, 4, (5, 9), 3>
- <4, 8, 6, (2, 9), 4>
