Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 4)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 1, 3)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 8, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 8, 4, 7)
- Cycle 6: (5, 8, 2, 9)
- Cycle 7: (5, 1, 3, 4)
- Cycle 8: (9, 1, 3, 4)
- Cycle 9: (9, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 10: (9, 7, 3, 4)
- Cycle 11: (9, 7, 4, 8)
- Cycle 12: (9, 7, 2, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 14: (4, 7, 9, 2)
- Cycle 15: (4, 7, 2, 8)
- Cycle 16: (4, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 17: (4, 8, 2, 9)
- Cycle 18: (4, 8, 0, 5)
- Cycle 19: (7, 3, 1, 5)
- Cycle 20: (7, 3, 4, 9)
- Cycle 21: (7, 3, 0, 5)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge):

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 2, 4> (Chord: (9, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 9, 8, 4> (Chord: (9, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 9, 1, 3> (Chord: (9, 1))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, 8, 2, 9> (Chord: (8, 9))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
