Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (5, 2) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the given graph. The cycles are:
1. Cycle 1: 0-1-6-9-0
2. Cycle 2: 0-3-7-9-0
3. Cycle 3: 1-2-5-8-1

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 1-9
- Cycle 2 has a chord 3-9
- Cycle 3 has no chord

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 1, 6, 9> (chord: 1-9)
<0, 3, 7, 9> (chord: 3-9)
