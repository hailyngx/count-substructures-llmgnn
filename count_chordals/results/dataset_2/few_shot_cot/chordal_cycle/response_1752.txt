Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle <1, 8, 13, 2> with edges (1, 8), (8, 13), (13, 2), (2, 17), (17, 7), (7, 1)
- Cycle <3, 11, 14, 1> with edges (3, 11), (11, 14), (14, 1), (1, 8), (8, 13), (13, 2), (2, 17), (17, 3)
- Cycle <5, 6, 9, 15> with edges (5, 6), (6, 9), (9, 15), (15, 5)
- Cycle <6, 8, 13, 10> with edges (6, 8), (8, 13), (13, 10), (10, 6)
- Cycle <7, 11, 3, 17> with edges (7, 11), (11, 3), (3, 17), (17, 7)
- Cycle <12, 4, 13, 2> with edges (12, 4), (4, 13), (13, 2), (2, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 8, 13, 2> has one chord: (17, 7)
- <3, 11, 14, 1> has one chord: (7, 17)
- <6, 8, 13, 10> has one chord: (6, 9)
- <7, 11, 3, 17> has one chord: (7, 1)
- <12, 4, 13, 2> has one chord: (12, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [5].
