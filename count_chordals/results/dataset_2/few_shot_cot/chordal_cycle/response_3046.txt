Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 3) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- 4-cycle: <0, 4, 8, 3, 0>
- 4-cycle: <0, 4, 8, 5, 0>
- 4-cycle: <0, 4, 8, 3, 6, 0>
- 4-cycle: <0, 9, 6, 3, 0>
- 4-cycle: <0, 9, 6, 3, 5, 0>
- 4-cycle: <2, 7, 6, 9, 2>
- 4-cycle: <2, 7, 6, 3, 2>
- 4-cycle: <2, 7, 6, 3, 5, 2>
- 4-cycle: <2, 9, 6, 3, 2>
- 4-cycle: <3, 1, 3, 5, 3>
- 4-cycle: <3, 5, 8, 3, 6, 5>
- 4-cycle: <3, 5, 8, 4, 3>
- 4-cycle: <3, 5, 8, 4, 0, 5>
- 4-cycle: <3, 6, 0, 9, 3>
- 4-cycle: <3, 6, 0, 4, 3>
- 4-cycle: <3, 6, 0, 5, 3>
- 4-cycle: <3, 6, 8, 3, 5, 6>
- 4-cycle: <3, 9, 0, 4, 3>
- 4-cycle: <3, 9, 0, 5, 3>
- 4-cycle: <3, 9, 6, 3, 5, 9>
- 4-cycle: <3, 9, 6, 7, 3>
- 4-cycle: <5, 0, 4, 8, 5>
- 4-cycle: <5, 0, 9, 6, 5>
- 4-cycle: <5, 2, 7, 6, 5>
- 4-cycle: <6, 0, 4, 8, 6>
- 4-cycle: <6, 2, 7, 9, 6>
- 4-cycle: <7, 6, 0, 4, 7>
- 4-cycle: <7, 9, 6, 2, 7>
- 4-cycle: <8, 3, 6, 0, 8>
- 4-cycle: <8, 3, 6, 7, 8>
- 4-cycle: <9, 0, 4, 8, 9>
- 4-cycle: <9, 2, 7, 6, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0, 4, 8, 3, 6, 0> has exactly one chord: (4, 5)
<2, 7, 6, 3, 2> has exactly one chord: (7, 9)
<2, 7, 6, 3, 5, 2> has exactly one chord: (7, 9)
<3, 5, 8, 3, 6, 5> has exactly one chord: (5, 0)
<3, 9, 6, 3, 5, 9> has exactly one chord: (6, 2)
<7, 9, 6, 2, 7> has exactly one chord: (9, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
[6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 4, 8, 3, 6, 0> with the chord (4, 5)
- <2, 7, 6, 3, 2> with the chord (7, 9)
- <2, 7, 6, 3, 5, 2> with the chord (7, 9)
- <3, 5, 8, 3, 6, 5> with the chord (5, 0)
- <3, 9, 6, 3, 5, 9> with the chord (6, 2)
- <7, 9, 6, 2, 7> with the chord (9, 5)
