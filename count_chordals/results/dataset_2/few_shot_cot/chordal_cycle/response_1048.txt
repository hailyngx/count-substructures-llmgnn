Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 7, 6, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 7, 9, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 4, 7, 6, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 6, 7, 9, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 6, 7, 4, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Only Cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 4, 0> has exactly one chord: (9, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- Since only Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle, the final count is [1].
