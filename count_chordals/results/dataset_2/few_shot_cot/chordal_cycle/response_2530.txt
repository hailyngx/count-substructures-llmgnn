Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <0, 8, 13, 6, 1, 12, 16, 11> (length 7)
        - Cycle 2: <0, 8, 13, 6, 15, 5, 19, 9, 14, 1, 12, 16, 11> (length 13)
        - Cycle 3: <4, 16, 12, 1, 6, 15, 5, 19, 9> (length 8)
        - Cycle 4: <7, 3, 6, 13, 8, 11, 12, 16, 18> (length 8)
        - Cycle 5: <7, 3, 6, 1, 12, 16, 18> (length 7)
        - Cycle 6: <7, 3, 6, 15, 5, 19, 9, 14, 0, 10> (length 10)
        - Cycle 7: <17, 4, 16, 12, 1, 6, 13, 10, 0, 14, 9> (length 11)
        - Cycle 8: <17, 4, 9, 19, 5, 15, 6, 1, 14, 0, 2> (length 11)
        - Cycle 9: <18, 16, 12, 1, 6, 15, 5, 19> (length 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        In the list above, Cycle 3: <4, 16, 12, 1, 6, 15, 5, 19, 9> has exactly one chord (16, 4).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        As there was only one cycle with exactly one chord, the count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
