Response:
Step 1: 
- 4-cycle: <4, 27, 25, 26>
- 4-cycle: <4, 22, 28, 2>
- 4-cycle: <4, 29, 25, 27>
- 4-cycle: <7, 29, 14, 10>
  
Step 2: 
- <4, 27, 25, 26>: Chord (25, 26)
- <4, 22, 28, 2>: Chord (22, 28)
- <4, 29, 25, 27>: Chord (25, 27)
- <7, 29, 14, 10>: Chord (14, 10)

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore [4].
