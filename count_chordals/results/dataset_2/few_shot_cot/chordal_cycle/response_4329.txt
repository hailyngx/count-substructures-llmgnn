Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 11>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 9, 12>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 9, 12>
- Cycle 4: <1, 3, 14, 5>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 2, 8>
- Cycle 6: <2, 13, 12, 9>
- Cycle 7: <3, 9, 7, 4>
- Cycle 8: <5, 2, 13, 12>
- Cycle 9: <5, 14, 3, 1>
- Cycle 10: <6, 1, 3, 9>
- Cycle 11: <8, 2, 13, 12>
- Cycle 12: <10, 13, 12, 0>
- Cycle 13: <11, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 14: <11, 6, 8, 0>
- Cycle 15: <11, 8, 2, 5>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 11, (8, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 14, 3, 1, (2, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <11, 6, 8, 0, (1, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <11, 8, 2, 5, (13, 12)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [11].
