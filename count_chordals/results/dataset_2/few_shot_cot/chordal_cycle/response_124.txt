Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more:
1. <0, 5, 9, 4>
2. <0, 5, 9, 3>
3. <0, 5, 9, 7>
4. <0, 4, 9, 7>
5. <1, 7, 9, 4>
6. <1, 7, 9, 3>
7. <2, 5, 9, 6>
8. <2, 5, 9, 7>
9. <2, 5, 8, 3>
10. <2, 7, 9, 6>
11. <3, 8, 5, 9>
12. <3, 8, 0, 5>
13. <3, 7, 9, 4>
14. <3, 7, 9, 1>
15. <4, 9, 7, 3>
16. <5, 9, 6, 2>
17. <5, 9, 0, 4>
18. <5, 9, 0, 8>
19. <7, 9, 4, 0>
20. <7, 9, 4, 1>

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, 5, 9, 4> - Chord: (0, 9)
2. <3, 7, 9, 4> - Chord: (3, 9)
3. <3, 8, 5, 9> - Chord: (5, 8)

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: [17]
