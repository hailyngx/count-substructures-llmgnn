- Cycle 6: <2, 18, 11, 9> 
- Cycle 7: <2, 18, 0, 16> 
- Cycle 8: <2, 12, 4, 7> 
- Cycle 9: <2, 12, 17, 8> 
- Cycle 10: <2, 19, 15, 6> 
- Cycle 11: <3, 11, 7, 4>

- Cycle 19: <6, 2, 18, 13> 
- Cycle 20: <6, 15, 13, 18> 
- Cycle 21: <6, 15, 19, 10> 
- Cycle 22: <7, 11, 18, 13>

- Cycle 36: <19, 2, 18, 11> 
- Cycle 37: <19, 10, 12, 4> 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Chordless cycle: <0, 18, 13, 15> 
- Chordless cycle: <1, 17, 4, 12> 
- Chordless cycle: <2, 12, 4, 7> 
- Chordless cycle: <3, 11, 7, 4> 
- Chordless cycle: <5, 9, 11, 7> 
- Chordless cycle: <8, 16, 9, 11> 
- Cycle with one chord: <2, 18, 13, 15>, chord (18, 2) 
- Cycle with one chord: <2, 19, 15, 6>, chord (19, 2) 
- Cycle with one chord: <3, 10, 19, 2>, chord (10, 3) 
- Cycle with one chord: <6, 15, 19, 10>, chord (6, 15) 
- Cycle with one chord: <11, 9, 5, 14>, chord (9, 11) 
- Cycle with one chord: <12, 17, 8, 16>, chord (17, 12) 
- Cycle with one chord: <16, 1, 17, 12>, chord (1, 16) 
- Cycle with one chord: <19, 10, 12, 4>, chord (10, 12) 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There are 6 chordless cycles found. 
Final count: [6]
