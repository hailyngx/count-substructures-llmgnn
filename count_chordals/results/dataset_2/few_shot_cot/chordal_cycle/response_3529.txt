Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 2, 4, 1>
- Cycle 2: <2, 4, 6, 5, 2>
- Cycle 3: <4, 6, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 4: <5, 6, 8, 12, 5>
- Cycle 5: <7, 11, 6, 5, 7>
- Cycle 6: <10, 7, 14, 9, 10>
- Cycle 7: <12, 8, 6, 5, 12>
- Cycle 8: <13, 10, 12, 2, 13>
- Cycle 9: <14, 7, 11, 6, 14>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<1, (4, 12), 2>

Step 3:
There is a total of [1] unique chordal 4-cycle found.
