Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 8, 4, 13, 9>
- Cycle 2: <0, 11, 3, 6, 13, 9>
- Cycle 3: <0, 10, 12, 1, 8, 4>
- Cycle 4: <0, 10, 5, 7, 2, 3>
- Cycle 5: <2, 5, 3, 6, 13, 4>
- Cycle 6: <2, 7, 4, 13, 9, 3>
- Cycle 7: <4, 7, 6, 10, 12, 14>
- Cycle 8: <4, 7, 2, 3, 5, 10>
- Cycle 9: <4, 8, 14, 12, 10, 5>
- Cycle 10: <6, 10, 12, 14, 8, 1>
  
Step 2: Check for a chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (4, 13) as (4, 13) connects non-adjacent nodes 4 and 13.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (11, 3) as (11, 3) connects non-adjacent nodes 11 and 3.
- Cycle 3 has a chord (8, 4) as (8, 4) connects non-adjacent nodes 8 and 4.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has a chord (5, 13) as (5, 13) connects non-adjacent nodes 5 and 13.
- Cycle 6 has a chord (4, 6) as (4, 6) connects non-adjacent nodes 4 and 6.
- Cycle 7 has no chords.
- Cycle 8 has no chords.
- Cycle 9 has a chord (14, 10) as (14, 10) connects non-adjacent nodes 14 and 10.
- Cycle 10 has a chord (12, 8) as (12, 8) connects non-adjacent nodes 12 and 8.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 4 chordless cycles found.

Final Answer: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 11, 3, 6>
<4, 7, 6, 10>
<0, 10, 5, 7>
<4, 8, 14, 12>
