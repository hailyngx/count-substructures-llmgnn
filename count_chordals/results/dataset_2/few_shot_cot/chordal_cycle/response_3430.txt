Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all edges existing:
- (0, 5, 13, 6)
- (0, 5, 19, 13)
- (0, 5, 19, 12)
- (0, 5, 19, 18)
- (0, 5, 13, 6, 4)
- (0, 5, 13, 6, 1)
- (0, 5, 19, 13, 6)
- (0, 10, 2, 14)
- (1, 4, 6, 13)
- (1, 4, 6, 13, 5)
- (1, 4, 6, 13, 19)
- (1, 4, 6, 13, 5, 19)
- (1, 11, 7, 17)
- (1, 11, 7, 17, 16)
- (1, 11, 7, 17, 16, 10)
- (1, 11, 7, 17, 16, 10, 2)
- (1, 11, 7, 17, 16, 10, 2, 14)

Step 2:
Checking for each cycle for a unique chord:
- Only the cycle <0, 5, 19, 13> has a unique chord between nodes 5 and 13.

Step 3:
Count of chordless 4-cycles: [21]
