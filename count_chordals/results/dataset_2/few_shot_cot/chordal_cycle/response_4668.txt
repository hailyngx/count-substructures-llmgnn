Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 17, 6, 12> with chord (0, 6)
2. <0, 17, 12, 6> with chord (0, 12)
3. <0, 16, 3, 2> with chord (0, 3)
4. <0, 16, 7, 11> with chord (0, 7)
5. <0, 16, 9, 15> with chord (0, 9)
6. <0, 18, 8, 16> with chord (0, 8)
7. <1, 5, 14, 12> with chord (1, 14)
8. <1, 11, 7, 16> with chord (1, 7)
9. <1, 11, 4, 19> with chord (1, 4)
10. <2, 3, 16, 8> with chord (2, 8)
11. <2, 3, 16, 7> with chord (2, 7)
12. <2, 3, 16, 9> with chord (2, 9)
13. <2, 15, 19, 4> with chord (2, 19)
14. <6, 12, 17, 0> with chord (0, 17)
15. <6, 12, 17, 0> with chord (0, 12)
16. <8, 16, 3, 2> with chord (2, 3)
17. <8, 16, 7, 11> with chord (7, 11)
18. <8, 16, 9, 15> with chord (9, 15)
19. <9, 15, 19, 4> with chord (9, 19)

Step 2:
After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, there are 5 chordal 4-cycles found.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [14].
