Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 6, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Based on the given information, the cycles with a length of 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 6, 4, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 5, 2, 4, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 4, 0, 3, 8, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 7, 9, 1)
- Cycle 5: (2, 4, 0, 5, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 4, 1, 6, 5, 2)
- Cycle 7: (3, 0, 5, 2, 7, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 0, 3, 8, 7, 6, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 1, 6, 7, 9, 1)
- Cycle 10: (5, 0, 4, 6, 5)

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <5, 4>
- Cycle 2 has a chord <5, 2>
- Cycle 4 has a chord <1, 9>
- Cycle 5 has a chord <0, 2>
- Cycle 6 has a chord <1, 5>
- Cycle 7 has a chord <0, 2>
- Cycle 8 has a chord <0, 7>
- Cycle 9 has a chord <1, 6>
- Cycle 10 has a chord <0, 4>

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 1 chordless cycle:
- Chordless cycle: (4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 4) which is not already listed above.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
