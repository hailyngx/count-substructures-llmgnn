Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 3, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 3, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 1, 4, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 2, 6, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 2, 7, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 5, 0, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 4, 0, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 4, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 4, 8, 6, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 4, 8, 7, 1>
- Cycle 11: <1, 7, 2, 6, 1>
- Cycle 12: <1, 7, 0, 5, 1>
- Cycle 13: <1, 8, 4, 6, 1>
- Cycle 14: <1, 8, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 15: <1, 8, 3, 5, 1>
- Cycle 16: <2, 9, 1, 3, 2>
- Cycle 17: <2, 9, 1, 4, 2>
- Cycle 18: <2, 6, 4, 3, 2>
- Cycle 19: <2, 6, 8, 7, 2>
- Cycle 20: <3, 5, 0, 7, 3>
- Cycle 21: <3, 1, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 22: <4, 6, 2, 9, 4>
- Cycle 23: <4, 1, 3, 5, 4>
- Cycle 24: <4, 1, 7, 0, 4>
- Cycle 25: <4, 8, 3, 5, 4>
- Cycle 26: <4, 0, 7, 2, 4>
- Cycle 27: <5, 0, 7, 2, 5>
- Cycle 28: <6, 2, 9, 1, 6>
- Cycle 29: <6, 2, 1, 4, 6>
- Cycle 30: <6, 8, 4, 3, 6>
- Cycle 31: <6, 8, 7, 0, 6>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 7, 1, 4, 0> has a chord (1,4)
- <1, 4, 6, 2, 1> has a chord (4,2)
- <2, 9, 1, 3, 2> has a chord (1,3)
- <3, 5, 0, 7, 3> has a chord (0,5)
- <4, 1, 7, 0, 4> has a chord (1,0)
- <6, 2, 9, 1, 6> has a chord (9,1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [31]
