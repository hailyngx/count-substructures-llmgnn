Response:
Following the steps provided, we first identify all cycles of length 4 in the graph by examining the adjacency list. Then we check each cycle for exactly one chord. Finally, we count the number of chordal 4-cycles.

1. From the given adjacency list, we can identify the following cycles of length 4:
- <0, 2, 29, 24, 0>
- <0, 2, 28, 17, 29, 0>
- <0, 2, 29, 12, 18, 15, 27, 4, 21, 0>
- <0, 20, 9, 20, 13, 28, 2, 0>
- <16, 7, 22, 24, 16>
- <16, 23, 26, 29, 2, 24, 16>
- <22, 24, 1, 24, 2, 29, 26, 23, 22>
- <8, 19, 4, 27, 15, 18, 12, 29, 26, 25, 6, 0, 21, 5, 4, 8>
- <11, 3, 11, 16, 8, 19, 23, 26, 25, 8, 7, 22, 14, 11>

2. Checking each cycle for a chord:
- <0, 2, 29, 24, 0> has a chord: (2, 24)
- <0, 2, 28, 17, 29, 0> has a chord: (2, 17)
- <0, 2, 29, 12, 18, 15, 27, 4, 21, 0> has a chord: (2, 12)
- <0, 20, 9, 20, 13, 28, 2, 0> has a chord: (20, 13)
- <16, 7, 22, 24, 16> has a chord: (7, 24)
- <16, 23, 26, 29, 2, 24, 16> has a chord: (23, 24)
- <22, 24, 1, 24, 2, 29, 26, 23, 22> has a chord: (1, 23)
- <8, 19, 4, 27, 15, 18, 12, 29, 26, 25, 6, 0, 21, 5, 4, 8> has no chord
- <11, 3, 11, 16, 8, 19, 23, 26, 25, 8, 7, 22, 14, 11> has no chord

3. Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [5]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 2, 29, 24, 0>, <16, 7, 22, 24, 16>, <22, 24, 1, 24, 2, 29, 26, 23, 22>, <0, 2, 28, 17, 29, 0>, <0, 2, 29, 12, 18, 15, 27, 4, 21, 0>
