Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph. We can identify them based on the given edges.

- Cycle 1: (0, 7, 10, 11, 4)
- Cycle 2: (0, 4, 15, 8, 1)
- Cycle 3: (0, 4, 17, 10, 7)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 5, 9)
- Cycle 5: (1, 14, 18, 8)
- Cycle 6: (2, 3, 5, 16)
- Cycle 7: (4, 11, 12, 9)
- Cycle 8: (4, 15, 14, 18)
- Cycle 9: (4, 17, 19, 0)
- Cycle 10: (5, 9, 12, 16)
- Cycle 11: (7, 10, 17, 19)
- Cycle 12: (7, 13, 16, 6)
- Cycle 13: (8, 15, 4, 11)
- Cycle 14: (12, 9, 5, 3)
- Cycle 15: (12, 11, 10, 7)
- Cycle 16: (13, 16, 5, 3)
- Cycle 17: (14, 1, 3, 2)
- Cycle 18: (14, 18, 6, 16)
- Cycle 19: (16, 13, 7, 0)

Step 2:
Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <1, (14, 8), 15): Cycle 5 has one chord 8.
- <4, (11, 17), 0): Cycle 3 has one chord 17.
- <5, (9, 12), 16): Cycle 10 has one chord 12.
- <7, (10, 17), 0): Cycle 11 has one chord 17.
- <9, (5, 16), 3): Cycle 4 has one chord 5.
- <14, (1, 3), 18): Cycle 17 has one chord 3.
- <16, (13, 6), 5): Cycle 12 has one chord 13.

Step 3:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [7].
