Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. Cycle <0, 3, 4, 13>
2. Cycle <0, 4, 12, 7>
3. Cycle <1, 2, 13, 8>
4. Cycle <1, 3, 5, 9>
5. Cycle <1, 8, 13, 4>
6. Cycle <3, 4, 6, 7>
7. Cycle <3, 4, 11, 13>
8. Cycle <3, 5, 9, 8>
9. Cycle <4, 6, 7, 14>
10. Cycle <5, 9, 8, 13>
11. Cycle <6, 7, 10, 2>
12. Cycle <7, 10, 2, 13>
13. Cycle <7, 12, 4, 9>
14. Cycle <10, 2, 13, 11>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, (4, 13), 3>
2. <0, (7, 12), 4>
3. <1, (2, 13), 8>
4. <1, (3, 5), 9>
5. <1, (8, 13), 4>
6. <3, (4, 6), 7>
7. <3, (11, 13), 4>
8. <4, (6, 7), 14>
9. <5, (8, 13), 9>
10. <6, (10, 2), 7>
11. <7, (10, 2), 13>
12. <7, (4, 9), 12>
13. <10, (2, 13), 11>

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [1].
