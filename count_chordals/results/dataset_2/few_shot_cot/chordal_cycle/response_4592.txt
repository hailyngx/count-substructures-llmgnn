Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <3, 15, 8, 19> with the chord (15, 8).

Following the steps outlined earlier:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: <3, 15, 8, 19>
- Cycle 2: <3, 15, 6, 9>
- Cycle 3: <3, 15, 18, 19>
- Cycle 4: <3, 15, 8, 19>
- Cycle 5: <15, 6, 9, 7>
- Cycle 6: <15, 18, 19, 13>
- Cycle 7: <15, 8, 19, 18>
- Cycle 8: <15, 18, 11, 6>
- Cycle 9: <6, 9, 0, 5>
- Cycle 10: <6, 11, 18, 15>
- Cycle 11: <9, 0, 10, 14>
- Cycle 12: <9, 0, 5, 14>
- Cycle 13: <5, 14, 10, 1>
- Cycle 14: <0, 10, 14, 17>
- Cycle 15: <0, 4, 16, 12>
- Cycle 16: <7, 9, 0, 5>
- Cycle 17: <7, 2, 16, 12>
- Cycle 18: <8, 19, 13, 1>
- Cycle 19: <19, 13, 1, 10>
- Cycle 20: <19, 18, 11, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 1: <3, 15, 8, 19> has exactly one chord: (15, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found which is [1].
