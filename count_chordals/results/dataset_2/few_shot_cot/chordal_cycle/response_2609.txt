Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. Cycle: 5 - 1 - 3 - 0 - 5
2. Cycle: 5 - 1 - 4 - 6 - 5
3. Cycle: 5 - 4 - 3 - 0 - 5
4. Cycle: 5 - 9 - 6 - 4 - 5
5. Cycle: 5 - 9 - 2 - 6 - 5
6. Cycle: 5 - 9 - 6 - 8 - 5
7. Cycle: 5 - 2 - 6 - 8 - 5
8. Cycle: 5 - 2 - 1 - 4 - 5
9. Cycle: 9 - 5 - 7 - 8 - 9

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, (0, 5), 1> has a chord (0, 5)
- <1, 4, (5, 6), 1> has a chord (5, 6)
- <4, 3, (0, 5), 4> has a chord (0, 5)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles = [3]
