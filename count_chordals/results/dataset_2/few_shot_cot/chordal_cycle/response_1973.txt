Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <6, 9, 26, 13>: Chord = (9, 26)
- <6, 9, 28, 11>: Chord = (9, 28)
- <6, 3, 8, 4, 5>: No chord
- <6, 20, 19, 3, 14>: No chord
- <13, 26, 16, 29, 15>: No chord
- <13, 26, 9, 6, 3>: No chord
- <13, 26, 16, 29, 7>: No chord
- <13, 16, 29, 7, 5>: No chord
- <13, 24, 12, 10, 22>: No chord
- <13, 24, 12, 15, 5>: No chord
- <13, 24, 25, 24, 12>: Chord = (24, 25)
- <13, 0, 12, 15, 5>: No chord
- <13, 0, 21, 1, 2>: No chord
- <13, 0, 12, 25, 24>: Chord = (12, 25)
- <13, 0, 21, 1, 2>: No chord
- <13, 0, 21, 22, 18>: No chord
- <9, 26, 16, 29, 7>: No chord
- <9, 26, 16, 29, 15>: No chord
- <9, 26, 13, 0, 12>: No chord
- <9, 26, 16, 13, 24>: No chord
- <9, 26, 13, 0, 21>: No chord
- <9, 26, 13, 24, 25>: No chord
- <9, 26, 13, 0, 21>: No chord
- <28, 9, 26, 16, 29>: No chord
- <28, 9, 26, 16, 13>: No chord
- <28, 9, 26, 13, 0>: No chord
- <28, 9, 26, 13, 24>: No chord
- <28, 9, 26, 13, 0>: No chord
