Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 4, 6, 7>
- <0, 4, 7, 1>
- <0, 4, 10, 11>
- <0, 8, 13, 7>
- <0, 8, 13, 1>
- <0, 8, 14, 11>
- <0, 9, 12, 13>
- <1, 7, 9, 13>
- <1, 8, 11, 14>
- <1, 8, 13, 5>
- <2, 0, 4, 6>
- <2, 0, 4, 7>
- <2, 0, 8, 13>
- <2, 5, 11, 14>
- <3, 0, 4, 7>
- <3, 0, 8, 13>
- <3, 14, 11, 5>
- <4, 6, 10, 11>
- <5, 1, 7, 9>
- <5, 1, 8, 13>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 6, 7> (Chord: (4, 6))
- <0, 8, 14, 11> (Chord: (8, 14))
- <0, 9, 12, 13> (Chord: (9, 12))
- <1, 8, 11, 14> (Chord: (8, 11))
- <2, 0, 8, 13> (Chord: (0, 8))
- <3, 14, 11, 5> (Chord: (14, 11))
- <6, 7, 9, 12> (Chord: (7, 9))
- <13, 7, 4, 6> (Chord: (7, 4))
- <14, 3, 0, 4> (Chord: (3, 0))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
