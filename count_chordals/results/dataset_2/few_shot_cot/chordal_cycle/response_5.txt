Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- <0, 4, 7, 1>
- <0, 4, 2, 5>
- <0, 6, 1, 5>
- <2, 4, 7, 3>
- <2, 5, 8, 4>
- <4, 9, 1, 7>
- <6, 3, 7, 1>
- <6, 5, 8, 4>
- <8, 5, 1, 7>
- <9, 4, 7, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, (4, 7), 1>
- <0, (4, 2), 5>
- <0, (6, 1), 5>
- <2, (4, 7), 3>
- <2, (5, 8), 4>
- <4, (9, 1), 7>
- <6, (3, 7), 1>
- <6, (5, 8), 4>
- <8, (5, 1), 7>
- <9, (4, 7), 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Number of chordal 4-cycles: [10]
