Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 6, 2>
- Cycle 2: <5, 1, 4, 2>
- Cycle 3: <5, 1, 4, 3>
- Cycle 4: <5, 1, 8, 4>
- Cycle 5: <5, 4, 2, 6>
- Cycle 6: <5, 4, 2, 1>
- Cycle 7: <5, 4, 2, 3>
- Cycle 8: <5, 4, 3, 7>
- Cycle 9: <5, 0, 2, 6>
- Cycle 10: <6, 1, 4, 2>
- Cycle 11: <6, 1, 8, 5>
- Cycle 12: <6, 2, 4, 1>
- Cycle 13: <6, 2, 4, 3>
- Cycle 14: <4, 1, 8, 5>
- Cycle 15: <4, 2, 1, 8>
- Cycle 16: <4, 2, 3, 7>
- Cycle 17: <4, 3, 7, 9>
- Cycle 18: <4, 3, 5, 9>
- Cycle 19: <4, 3, 2, 6>
- Cycle 20: <1, 8, 5, 9>
- Cycle 21: <1, 8, 4, 2>
- Cycle 22: <3, 7, 9, 5>
- Cycle 23: <3, 7, 9, 6>
- Cycle 24: <3, 5, 9, 7>

Step 2:
- Chordal cycle 1: <5, 1, 4, 2> (chord: (1, 4))
- Chordal cycle 2: <5, 4, 2, 6> (chord: (2, 6))

Step 3:
- There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
