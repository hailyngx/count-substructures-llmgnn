Step 2:
We will now check each cycle for the presence of exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles: 
<2, 13, 12, 7>, chord: (7, 16)
<2, 18, 5, 9>, chord: (5, 18)
<4, 10, 5, 9>, chord: (5, 10)
<6, 9, 15, 11>, chord: (9, 15)
<6, 7, 16, 1>, chord: (7, 16)
<7, 12, 13, 2>, chord: (12, 13)
<10, 4, 11, 16>, chord: (4, 11)
<18, 2, 13, 11>, chord: (2, 13)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [8]
