Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 8, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 5, 2, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 0, 3, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 5, 2, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 8, 5, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 6, 7, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 0, 4, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 8, 1, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 6, 7, 1, 2>
- Cycle 10: <2, 3, 0, 4, 2>
- Cycle 11: <2, 3, 1, 4, 2>
- Cycle 12: <3, 6, 7, 1, 3>
- Cycle 13: <3, 0, 4, 1, 3>
  
Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 4, 0, 3, 1> (chord: 3-0)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, 5, 8, 1, 2> (chord: 5-8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordless cycles = 13 - 2 = [11]

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles in the graph is [11].
