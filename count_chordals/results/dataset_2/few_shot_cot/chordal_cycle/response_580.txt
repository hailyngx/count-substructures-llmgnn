Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 3>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 1, 6>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 4, 7>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 2, 6>
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle 6: <0, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 7: <0, 9, 7, 6>
- Cycle 8: <1, 5, 4, 7>
- Cycle 9: <1, 5, 2, 6>
- Cycle 10: <1, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 11: <2, 5, 4, 7>
- Cycle 12: <3, 9, 7, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 4, 7> has one chord 4-7
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 2, 6> has one chord 2-6
- Cycle 10: <1, 6, 7, 4> has one chord 6-4
- Cycle 11: <2, 5, 4, 7> has one chord 5-7
- Cycle 12: <3, 9, 7, 4> has one chord 9-7

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
We found 12 cycles initially, and 5 of them have exactly one chord. So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 5, 1, 3>
<0, 5, 1, 6>
<0, 9, 3, 1>
<0, 9, 8, 4>
<0, 9, 7, 6>
<1, 5, 2, 6>
<1, 6, 7, 4>
