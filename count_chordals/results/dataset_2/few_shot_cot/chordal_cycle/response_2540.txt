Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 8, 12, 6, 0>
- <0, 8, 12, 3, 0>
- <0, 8, 10, 9, 1, 0>
- <0, 8, 10, 11, 5, 2, 0>
- <0, 8, 10, 11, 5, 1, 0>
- <0, 11, 5, 7, 3, 0>
- <0, 11, 5, 7, 6, 0>
- <0, 11, 10, 9, 1, 0>
- <0, 6, 12, 13, 7, 5, 2, 0>
- <1, 13, 12, 8, 10, 11, 5, 2, 0, 1>
- <1, 13, 12, 8, 10, 11, 0, 1>
- <1, 13, 9, 10, 11, 5, 2, 0, 1>
- <1, 13, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1>

Step 2: Checking for chords:
- <0, 8, 12, 6, 0>  (Chord: 12-6)
- <0, 8, 12, 3, 0>  (Chord: 8-3)
- <0, 8, 10, 9, 1, 0>  (Chord: 9-1)
- <0, 8, 10, 11, 5, 2, 0>  (Chord: 2-5)
- <0, 8, 10, 11, 5, 1, 0>  (Chord: 1-5)
- <0, 11, 5, 7, 3, 0>  (Chord: 3-7)
- <0, 11, 5, 7, 6, 0>  (Chord: 5-7)
- <0, 11, 10, 9, 1, 0>  (Chord: 9-10)
- <0, 6, 12, 13, 7, 5, 2, 0>  (Chord: 5-13)
- <1, 13, 12, 8, 10, 11, 5, 2, 0, 1>  (Chord: 8-12)
- <1, 13, 12, 8, 10, 11, 0, 1>  (Chord: 8-12)
- <1, 13, 9, 10, 11, 5, 2, 0, 1>  (Chord: 5-10)
- <1, 13, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1>  (Chord: 9-10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
- There are 12 chordal 4-cycles found, so the result is [12].
