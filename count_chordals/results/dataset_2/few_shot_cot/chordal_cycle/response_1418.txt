Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <5, 9, (13, 21), 24>
- Chordal Cycle 2: <16, 5, (2, 28), 7>
- Chordal Cycle 3: <17, 7, (26, 1), 3>
- Chordal Cycle 4: <9, 20, (11, 23), 27>
- Chordal Cycle 5: <23, 29, (4, 22), 16>
- Chordal Cycle 6: <3, 12, (18, 6), 17>
- Chordal Cycle 7: <5, 16, (2, 28), 8>
- Chordal Cycle 8: <7, 24, (26, 1), 4>
- Chordal Cycle 9: <9, 20, (0, 15), 0>
- Chordal Cycle 10: <23, 9, (20, 0), 28>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 16.
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
