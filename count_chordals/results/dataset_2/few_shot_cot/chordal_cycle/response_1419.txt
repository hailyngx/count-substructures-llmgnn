- <0, 4, 7, 2> 
- <0, 4, 12, 6> 
- <0, 4, 12, 8> 
- <0, 4, 1, 14> 
- <0, 9, 11, 6> 
- <0, 9, 11, 14> 
- <0, 13, 8, 5> 
- <0, 13, 12, 3> 
- <0, 13, 12, 4> 
- <0, 14, 1, 4> 
- <1, 4, 7, 3> 
- <1, 4, 7, 5>

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle: 
- <0, 4, 7, 2>: Chord (4, 7) 
- <0, 4, 12, 6>: Chord (4, 12) 
- <0, 4, 12, 8>: Chord (4, 12) 
- <0, 4, 1, 14>: Chord (1, 4) 
- <0, 9, 11, 6>: Chord (9, 11) 
- <0, 9, 11, 14>: Chord (9, 11) 
- <0, 13, 8, 5>: Chord (8, 5) 
- <0, 13, 12, 3>: Chord (12, 3) 
- <0, 13, 12, 4>: Chord (12, 4) 
- <0, 14, 1, 4>: Chord (1, 4) 
- <1, 4, 7, 3>: Chord (4, 7) 
- <1, 4, 7, 5>: Chord (4, 7) 
- <1, 4, 12, 6>: Chord (4, 12) 
- <1, 3, 7, 5>: Chord (7, 5) 
- <1, 3, 13, 12>: Chord (13, 12)

- <1, 2, 11, 6>: Chord (11, 6) 
- <1, 2, 11, 14>: Chord (11, 14) 
- <1, 2, 11, 8>: Chord (11, 8) 
- <1, 14, 0, 4>: Chord (0, 4) 
- <2, 7, 4, 12>: Chord (4, 12) 
- <2, 7, 4, 1>: Chord (4, 1) 
- <3, 7, 4, 12>: Chord (4, 12) 
- <3, 13, 12, 4>: Chord (12, 4) 
- <4, 12, 6, 7>: Chord (6, 7) 
- <4, 12, 8, 13>: Chord (8, 13) 
- <4, 12, 8, 5>: Chord (8, 5)

- <11, 8, 13, 3>: Chord (8, 13) 
- <11, 8, 13, 0>: Chord (8, 13) 
- <11, 8, 5, 7>: Chord (8, 5) 

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have a total of [36].
