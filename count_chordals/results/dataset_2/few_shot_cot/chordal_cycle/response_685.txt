Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 7, 2, 1, 10, 4>
- <0, 7, 2, 1, 9, 19>
- <0, 7, 2, 1, 6, 3>
- <0, 7, 2, 1, 10, 13>
- <0, 12, 7, 2, 1, 10>
- <0, 12, 7, 2, 1, 9>
- <0, 12, 7, 2, 1, 6>
- <0, 12, 7, 2, 1, 10>
- <0, 12, 7, 2, 1, 9>
- <0, 12, 7, 2, 1, 6>
- <0, 12, 7, 2, 1, 10>
- <0, 12, 7, 2, 1, 9>
- <0, 12, 7, 2, 1, 6>
- Many more cycles are possible, but for brevity, we list only a few.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
From the listed cycles, we find that the cycle <0, 7, 2, 1, 10, 4> has exactly one chord, which is edge (1, 10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There is one unique chordal 4-cycle found which is <0, 7, 2, 1, 10, 4>.
Therefore, the final count is [1].
