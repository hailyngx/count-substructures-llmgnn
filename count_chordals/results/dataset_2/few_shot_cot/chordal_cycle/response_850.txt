Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. <0, 10, 11, 4>
2. <0, 11, 12, 7>
3. <1, 8, 10, 9>
4. <2, 13, 7, 6>
5. <3, 9, 4, 6>
6. <4, 10, 11, 12>
7. <4, 13, 7, 2>
8. <4, 14, 7, 12>
9. <6, 7, 13, 5>
10. <7, 13, 2, 11>
11. <7, 14, 12, 3>
12. <11, 10, 8, 1>
13. <12, 11, 4, 3>
14. <12, 7, 14, 2>
15. <14, 7, 13, 5>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
<0, 10, 11, 4, (2, 13)>

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord, so the final count is [1].
