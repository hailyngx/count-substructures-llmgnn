Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <2, (4, 7), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <7, (3, 14), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <8, (9, 12), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <12, (6, 16), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <15, (8, 18), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <17, (1, 19), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As all cycles in this graph have one chord each, there are [0] chordless cycles.
