Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent nodes connected by an edge):
- Chordal cycle found: <9, (4, 13), 8>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
Based on the cycles listed, there are a total of [124] cycles before identifying chordal cycles. So the final number of chordless cycles is [123].
