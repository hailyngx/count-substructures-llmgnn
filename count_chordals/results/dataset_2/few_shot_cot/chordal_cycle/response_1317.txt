Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 6, 1, 9>
- <0, 6, 7, 1>
- <0, 6, 7, 14>
- <0, 12, 2, 9>
- <1, 9, 5, 4>
- <1, 9, 6, 11>
- <1, 9, 7, 14>
- <2, 9, 5, 4>
- <3, 6, 7, 14>
- <4, 5, 9, 7>
- <4, 5, 9, 14>
- <4, 7, 14, 8>
- <8, 14, 7, 9>
- <10, 12, 2, 9>
- <11, 6, 7, 14>
- <11, 6, 9, 5>
- <11, 13, 2, 9>

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 6, 1, 9> has chord (6, 1)
- <0, 6, 7, 1> has chord (6, 1)
- <0, 6, 7, 14> has chord (6, 14)
- <0, 12, 2, 9> has chord (12, 2)
- <1, 9, 5, 4> has chord (9, 5)
- <1, 9, 6, 11> has chord (9, 11)
- <1, 9, 7, 14> has chord (9, 14)
- <2, 9, 5, 4> has chord (9, 5)
- <3, 6, 7, 14> has chord (6, 7)
- <4, 5, 9, 7> has chord (5, 7)
- <4, 5, 9, 14> has chord (5, 14)
- <4, 7, 14, 8> has chord (7, 8)
- <8, 14, 7, 9> has chord (14, 9)
- <10, 12, 2, 9> has chord (12, 2)
- <11, 6, 7, 14> has chord (6, 7)
- <11, 6, 9, 5> has chord (6, 5)
- <11, 13, 2, 9> has chord (13, 9)

Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [16].
