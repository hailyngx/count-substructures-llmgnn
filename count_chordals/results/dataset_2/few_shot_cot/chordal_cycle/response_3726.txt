Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in this graph, but not all of them have all edges present. 
We have the following cycles with all edges present:
1. Cycle <4, 7, 5, 1>
2. Cycle <4, 0, 3, 1>
3. Cycle <0, 3, 5, 6>
4. Cycle <7, 1, 5, 3>
5. Cycle <6, 9, 7, 1>
6. Cycle <6, 0, 4, 7>
  
Step 2:
Checking for chords in these cycles:
1. Cycle <4, 7, 5, 1> has a chord: (4,1)
2. Cycle <4, 0, 3, 1> has a chord: (3,0)
3. Cycle <0, 3, 5, 6> has a chord: (3,5)
4. Cycle <7, 1, 5, 3> has a chord: (1,5)
5. Cycle <6, 9, 7, 1> has a chord: (9,7)
6. Cycle <6, 0, 4, 7> has a chord: (0,7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
The only chordless cycle is <6, 9, 7, 1>.
So, the final count inside brackets is [1].
