- <9, 1, 14, 12>
- <10, 13, 8, 0>
- <10, 13, 8, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 8, 13, 12> (Chord: 8, 13)
- <1, 9, 5, 2> (Chord: 5, 9)
- <1, 9, 5, 4> (Chord: 9, 5)
- <1, 2, 5, 7> (Chord: 2, 5)
- <1, 2, 14, 4> (Chord: 2, 14)
- <1, 7, 6, 12> (Chord: 6, 12)
- <2, 5, 9, 1> (Chord: 5, 9)
- <2, 5, 9, 4> (Chord: 5, 9)
- <2, 8, 13, 10> (Chord: 8, 13)
- <3, 8, 13, 10> (Chord: 8, 13)
- <4, 5, 9, 1> (Chord: 5, 9)
- <4, 9, 1, 14> (Chord: 1, 9)
- <4, 9, 11, 5> (Chord: 9, 11)
- <6, 7, 5, 9> (Chord: 5, 7)
- <6, 12, 13, 8> (Chord: 12, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 14 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
