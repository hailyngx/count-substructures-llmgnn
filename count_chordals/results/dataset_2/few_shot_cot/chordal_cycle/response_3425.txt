Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <0, 4, 10, 13>. 

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4: 
- Cycle 1: 0-4-10-13-0
- Cycle 2: 0-8-14-13-0
- Cycle 3: 4-1-13-10-4
- Cycle 4: 4-1-9-10-4
- Cycle 5: 4-10-0-8-4
- Cycle 6: 4-10-6-11-4
- Cycle 7: 4-13-14-8-4
- Cycle 8: 5-2-4-10-5
- Cycle 9: 5-7-4-13-5

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has the chord 4-10
- Cycle 2 has the chord 8-14
- Cycle 3 has the chord 1-13
- Cycle 4 has the chord 1-9
- Cycle 5 has the chord 0-8
- Cycle 6 has the chord 6-11
- Cycle 7 has the chord 13-14
- Cycle 8 has the chord 2-4
- Cycle 9 has the chord 4-13

Step 3: Counting chordless cycles:
There are no chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
