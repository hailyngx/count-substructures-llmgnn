Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (5, 8) (5, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <6, 1, 3, 6>
2. <6, 1, 7, 0, 6>
3. <6, 2, 7, 5, 8, 4, 6>
4. <9, 1, 3, 6, 9>
5. <9, 1, 7, 0, 9>
6. <9, 2, 7, 5, 8, 9>
7. <1, 3, 0, 7, 1>
8. <1, 3, 8, 7, 2, 9, 6, 1>
9. <1, 7, 0, 4, 8, 3, 6, 1>
10. <3, 0, 7, 5, 8, 4, 6, 3>
11. <4, 0, 7, 5, 8, 9, 6, 4>
12. <8, 7, 5, 8>
13. <8, 7, 0, 4, 6, 9, 8>
14. <0, 7, 5, 8, 9, 6, 0>
15. <7, 5, 8, 9, 6, 7>
16. <2, 7, 5, 8, 9, 6, 2>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <6, 1, 3, 6, (2, 7)>
2. <9, 1, 3, 6, (2, 7)>
3. <9, 1, 7, 0, 9, (6, 3)>
4. <1, 3, 0, 7, 1, (4, 6)>
5. <1, 7, 0, 4, 8, 3, 6, 1, (9, 5)>
6. <3, 0, 7, 5, 8, 4, 6, 3, (1, 9)>
7. <8, 7, 0, 4, 6, 9, 8, (3, 5)>
   
Step 3:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
