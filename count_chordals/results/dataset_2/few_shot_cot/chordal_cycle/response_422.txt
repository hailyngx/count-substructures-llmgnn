Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 5) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 7) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 12) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 7) (14, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 0) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 0) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 14) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 12, 13, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 11, 5, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 10, 5, 0, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 13, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 10, 11, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 13, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 10, 11, 4, 14, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 11, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 4, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 7, and node 2

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in this graph are as follows:

<1, (4, 7), 11)>
<4, (1, 10), 11)>
<4, (1, 11), 7)>
<4, (7, 10), 1)>
<5, (2, 13), 3)>
<5, (2, 14), 7)>
<7, (4, 11), 1)>
<7, (8, 11), 4)>
<7, (10, 4), 11)>
<8, (1, 11), 7)>
<10, (4, 7), 11)>
<13, (0, 3), 5)>

Since there are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the final answer is [12].
