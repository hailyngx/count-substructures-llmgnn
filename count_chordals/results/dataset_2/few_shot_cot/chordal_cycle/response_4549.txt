Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 2, 6, 4, 0>
2. <0, 4, 13, 10, 1, 14, 8, 0>
3. <1, 3, 2, 6, 12, 11, 1>
4. <1, 10, 13, 8, 14, 11, 1>
5. <4, 13, 8, 12, 6, 4>
6. <5, 7, 14, 8, 12, 9, 5>
7. <5, 9, 12, 6, 13, 4, 5>
8. <8, 14, 7, 5, 0, 2, 6, 12, 8>
9. <9, 5, 0, 2, 6, 12, 11, 14, 9>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
<0, 2, 6, 4, (0, 6)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [8].
