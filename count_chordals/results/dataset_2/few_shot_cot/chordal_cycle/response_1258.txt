Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 7, and node 4

Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  

There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph. One of them is:

1. Cycle <0, 9, 5, 4>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  

For the cycle <0, 9, 5, 4>, we can see that adding the edge (9, 5) would create exactly one chord.  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].  

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, 5, 4> with chord (9, 5)
