Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <1, 11, 22, 7> with the non-adjacent chord formed by the edge between nodes 1 and 7.

Step 1: All cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 21 - 6 - 15 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 21 - 6 - 15 - 25 - 18 - 2 - 24 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 28 - 1 - 22 - 11 - 14 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 4: 1 - 22 - 7 - 19 - 10 - 23 - 16 - 17 - 1
- Cycle 5: 7 - 22 - 11 - 2 - 26 - 14 - 5 - 13 - 7
- Cycle 6: 7 - 22 - 12 - 24 - 27 - 29 - 7
- Cycle 7: 13 - 21 - 6 - 15 - 25 - 18 - 2 - 26 - 14 - 13
- Cycle 8: 19 - 7 - 22 - 11 - 27 - 24 - 9 - 10 - 19
- Cycle 9: 8 - 26 - 2 - 24 - 9 - 19 - 10 - 23 - 4 - 8
- Cycle 10: 15 - 6 - 21 - 11 - 27 - 24 - 12 - 22 - 7 - 15
- Cycle 11: 16 - 17 - 1 - 28 - 13 - 14 - 26 - 2 - 11 - 16
- Cycle 12: 18 - 25 - 15 - 6 - 21 - 0 - 28 - 16 - 23 - 27 - 18
- Cycle 13: 20 - 3 - 8 - 26 - 2 - 11 - 27 - 29 - 7 - 22 - 12 - 20

Step 2: Checking for chords:
- Cycle 1: No chord
- Cycle 2: No chord
- Cycle 3: No chord
- Cycle 4: No chord
- Cycle 5: No chord
- Cycle 6: No chord
- Cycle 7: No chord
- Cycle 8: No chord
- Cycle 9: No chord
- Cycle 10: No chord
- Cycle 11: No chord
- Cycle 12: No chord
- Cycle 13: No chord

Step 3: Number of chordless 4-cycles = [0]
