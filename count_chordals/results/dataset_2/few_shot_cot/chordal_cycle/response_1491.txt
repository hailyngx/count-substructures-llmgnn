- Cycle 17: <2, 5, 1, 4, 8> (Chordless)
- Cycle 18: <2, 7, 8, 6, 0> (Chordless)
- Cycle 19: <2, 7, 8, 9, 4> (Chordless)

- Cycle 31: <4, 5, 1, 0, 6> (Chordless)
- Cycle 32: <5, 2, 7, 8, 6> (Chordless)
- Cycle 33: <5, 1, 0, 6, 3> (Chordless)

Step 2: Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- Only Cycle 0: <0, 6, 8, 7, 2> has a chord, which is edge (6, 2).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle is: <0, (6, 2), 8, 7, 2>.
