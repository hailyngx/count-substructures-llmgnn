Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 1, 3> with chord (1,13)
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 11, 5> with chord (5,8)
- Cycle 3: <1, 7, 11, 5> with chord (1,3)
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 9, 3> with chord (9,12)
- Cycle 5: <2, 10, 6, 2> with chord (6,12)
- Cycle 6: <3, 4, 7, 1> with chord (7,9)
- Cycle 7: <3, 1, 10, 5> with chord (10,6)
- Cycle 8: <3, 1, 12, 2> with chord (1,7)
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 11, 5> with chord (4,13)
- Cycle 10: <5, 11, 13, 0> with chord (0,7)

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 7, 1, 3> with chord (1,13)
- <0, 7, 11, 5> with chord (5,8)
- <1, 7, 11, 5> with chord (1,3)
- <1, 7, 9, 3> with chord (9,12)
- <3, 1, 10, 5> with chord (10,6)

Step 3:
There are [5] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
