Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more.

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 14>
- Cycle 2: <0, 12, 7, 2>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 7, 14>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 0, 4>
- Cycle 5: (Chordal 4-cycle) <1, 5, 14, 11>
- Cycle 6: <1, 11, 3, 0>
- Cycle 7: <2, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle 8: <2, 9, 11, 14>
- Cycle 9: <2, 13, 6, 14>
- Cycle 10: <3, 12, 7, 5>
- Cycle 11: <6, 12, 7, 5>
- Cycle 12: <6, 14, 11, 1>
- Cycle 13: <6, 14, 8, 4>
- Cycle 14: <6, 13, 2, 7>
- Cycle 15: <8, 7, 2, 1>
- Cycle 16: (Chordal 4-cycle) <10, 5, 7, 14>
- Cycle 17: <13, 10, 5, 0>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 5 is a chordal 4-cycle <1, 5, 14, 11>.
- Cycle 16 is a chordal 4-cycle <10, 5, 7, 14>.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 15 chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
