Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph, but we are interested in cycles of length 4 or more. 
One of the cycles in the graph is <4, 7, 1, 5, 4>. 

Step 2:
The cycle <4, 7, 1, 5, 4> has exactly one chord, which is the edge between nodes 1 and 5. So, this cycle is a chordal 4-cycle. 

Step 3:
Since we found one chordal 4-cycle, the number of chordless cycles is [0]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <<4, 7, 1, 5, 4>, (1, 5)>
