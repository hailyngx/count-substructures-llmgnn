Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, but we will focus on cycles of length 4:

- Cycle 1: 0-5-9-3-0
- Cycle 2: 2-7-12-3-2
- Cycle 3: 4-3-9-5-4
- Cycle 4: 6-4-15-14-6
- Cycle 5: 1-12-7-16-1
- Cycle 6: 6-16-7-11-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has a chord 5-9, making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 2 has a chord 7-12, making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 has a chord 9-5, making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 4 has a chord 15-14, making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 5 has a chord 12-7, making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 6 has a chord 16-7, making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles with 4 or more nodes in the graph.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, 5, 9, 3> with chord (5, 9)
2. <2, 7, 12, 3> with chord (7, 12)
3. <4, 3, 9, 5> with chord (9, 5)
4. <6, 4, 15, 14> with chord (15, 14)
5. <1, 12, 7, 16> with chord (12, 7)
6. <6, 16, 7, 11> with chord (16, 7)
