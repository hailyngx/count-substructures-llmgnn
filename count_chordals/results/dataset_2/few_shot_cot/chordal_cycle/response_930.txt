Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, listed with existing edges, are:
- <6, 14, 16, 9>
- <6, 14, 7, 10>
- <6, 2, 17, 10>
- <6, 2, 11, 18>
- <6, 11, 5, 16>
- <6, 11, 13, 0>
- <6, 11, 5, 15>
- <6, 11, 18, 19>
- <6, 8, 13, 11>
- <8, 13, 0, 3>
- <8, 13, 11, 18>
- <8, 13, 11, 5>
- <13, 0, 3, 4>
- <13, 11, 5, 15>
- <14, 6, 2, 17>
- <14, 6, 11, 18>
- <14, 6, 11, 5>
- <14, 16, 9, 1>
- <14, 16, 5, 15>
- <9, 16, 5, 11>
- <9, 16, 14, 7>
- <9, 1, 12, 10>
- <10, 12, 1, 9>
- <10, 12, 7, 14>
The unique cycles are:
- <6, 14, 16, 9>
- <6, 14, 7, 10>
- <6, 2, 17, 10>
- <6, 2, 11, 18>
- <6, 11, 5, 16>
- <6, 11, 13, 0>
- <6, 11, 18, 19>
- <6, 8, 13, 11>
- <8, 13, 0, 3>
- <8, 13, 11, 18>
- <8, 13, 11, 5>
- <13, 0, 3, 4>
- <14, 6, 2, 17>
- <14, 6, 11, 18>
- <14, 6, 11, 5>
- <14, 16, 9, 1>
- <14, 16, 5, 15>
- <9, 16, 5, 11>
- <9, 16, 14, 7>
- <9, 1, 12, 10>
- <10, 12, 1, 9>
- <10, 12, 7, 14>

Step 2:
Among the unique cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- <6, 14, 16, 9, (14, 16)>
- <6, 2, 17, 10, (2, 17)>
- <6, 2, 11, 18, (2, 11)>
- <6, 11, 5, 16, (11, 5)>
- <6, 11, 13, 0, (11, 13)>
- <6, 11, 18, 19, (11, 18)>
- <8, 13, 0, 3, (13, 0)>
- <8, 13, 11, 18, (13, 11)>
- <8, 13, 11, 5, (13, 11)>
- <13, 0, 3, 4, (3, 4)>
- <14, 6, 2, 17, (6, 2)>
- <14, 6, 11, 18, (6, 11)>
- <14, 16, 9, 1, (9, 1)>
- <9, 16, 5, 11, (9, 11)>
- <9, 1, 12, 10, (1, 10)>
- <10, 12, 1, 9, (1, 9)>

Step 3:
Counting the above chordal 4-cycles gives us a total of [15].
