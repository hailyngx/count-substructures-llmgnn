Response:
Step 1: 
- There are three cycles of length 4 in the graph:
    1. <3, 9, 26, 27>
    2. <4, 25, 27, 12>
    3. <7, 17, 20, 24>

Step 2:
- The cycle <3, 9, 26, 27> has a chord with edge (9, 26).
- The cycle <4, 25, 27, 12> has a chord with edge (4, 27).
- The cycle <7, 17, 20, 24> has a chord with edge (17, 24).

Step 3:
- There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle in the graph. 

Therefore, the answer is [1].
