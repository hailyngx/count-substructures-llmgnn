Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 12, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (3, 15), 10> has one chord (3, 15).
- <2, (3, 15), 10> has one chord (3, 15).
- <3, (3, 15), 12> has one chord (3, 15).
- <4, (3, 15), 10> has one chord (3, 15).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
