Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <5, (5, 10), 19, 15)> with only one chord connecting nodes 5 and 10. 

Now, let's count the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph:
There are 3 chordless 4-cycles in the graph, which are:
1. <2, 22, 14, 7>
2. <7, 14, 28, 13>
3. <16, 17, 5, 10>

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
