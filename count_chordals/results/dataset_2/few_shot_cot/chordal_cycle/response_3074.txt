Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 1 - 3 - 12 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 3 - 12 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 4 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 4 - 18 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 6 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 6: 1 - 6 - 12 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 7: 1 - 12 - 3 - 12 - 1
- Cycle 8: 2 - 5 - 10 - 2
- Cycle 9: 4 - 18 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 10: 5 - 10 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 11: 5 - 17 - 18 - 5
- Cycle 12: 5 - 19 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 13: 6 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 14: 8 - 13 - 8
- Cycle 15: 8 - 10 - 5 - 8
- Cycle 16: 8 - 15 - 17 - 18 - 8
- Cycle 17: 10 - 16 - 14 - 10
- Cycle 18: 10 - 16 - 9 - 10
- Cycle 19: 10 - 0 - 19 - 5 - 10
- Cycle 20: 11 - 9 - 18 - 11
- Cycle 21: 14 - 0 - 19 - 14
- Cycle 22: 15 - 17 - 18 - 15
- Cycle 23: 16 - 14 - 0 - 16
- Cycle 24: 16 - 14 - 10 - 16

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 12), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (3, 12), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (4, 18), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (4, 18), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (10, 2), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, (17, 18), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <8, (15, 17), 18>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <16, (14, 0), 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

Total number of chordless cycles = 24 - 8 = 16

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
