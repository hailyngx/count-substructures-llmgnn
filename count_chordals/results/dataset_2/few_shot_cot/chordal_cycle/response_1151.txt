Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 4, 1, 7, 8, 6, 0>
- <0, 4, 1, 7, 5, 2, 0>
- <0, 4, 5, 6, 9, 7, 0>
- <2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 2>
- <2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 7, 2>
- <3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 3>
- <3, 7, 5, 4, 2, 1, 3>
- <8, 7, 5, 4, 0, 6, 8>
  
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 1, 7, 8, 6, 0> has 2 chords: (1, 7) and (8, 6)
- <0, 4, 1, 7, 5, 2, 0> has 1 chord: (1, 5)
- <0, 4, 5, 6, 9, 7, 0> has 1 chord: (5, 9)
- <2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7, 2> has 1 chord: (5, 7)
- <2, 1, 4, 5, 3, 7, 2> has 1 chord: (1, 3)
- <3, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 3> has 1 chord: (1, 5)
- <3, 7, 5, 4, 2, 1, 3> has 1 chord: (5, 2)
- <8, 7, 5, 4, 0, 6, 8> has 1 chord: (5, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
