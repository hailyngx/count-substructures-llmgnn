Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 8, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 6, 1, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 3, 7, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 8, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 9, 8, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 9, 6, 1, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 9, 8, 4, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 8, 0, 5, 2>
- Cycle 10: <3, 6, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle 11: <4, 8, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 7, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle 13: <5, 3, 7, 9, 5>
- Cycle 14: <5, 6, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 15: <7, 4, 8, 9, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, 5, 3, 7, 0>
- Chord: (5, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There is 14 chordless cycles found.

Thus, the final count is [14].
