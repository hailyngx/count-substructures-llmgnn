Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 17) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 16) (13, 5) (13, 3) (10, 17) (10, 16) (17, 9) (17, 7) (17, 10) (17, 11) (2, 8) (2, 18) (2, 1) (2, 0) (18, 2) (18, 12) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 19) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 16) (0, 12) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 15) (15, 1) (15, 19) (15, 14) (19, 5) (19, 15) (19, 11) (16, 8) (16, 10) (16, 0) (16, 3) (11, 17) (11, 19) (11, 14) (14, 8) (14, 15) (14, 11) (14, 3) (12, 18) (12, 0) (3, 13) (3, 16) (3, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 2, 16, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 15
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 18, 1, and node 0

Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 13, and node 19
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 17
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 14, and node 16
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 17, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 17, and node 16

Node 16 is connected to node 8, 10, 0, and node 3
Node 17 is connected to node 9, 7, 10, and node 11
Node 18 is connected to node 2, and node 12
Node 19 is connected to node 5, 15, and node 11

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord in the given graph are as follows:
<1, (2, 18), 15)>
<3, (14, 8), 16)>
<4, (1, 9), 5)>
<6, (9, 17), 5)>
<8, (2, 8), 14)>
<10, (16, 8), 3)>
<11, (17, 19), 14)>
<12, (18, 2), 0)>
<13, (5, 13), 3)>
<15, (1, 15), 19)>
<16, (8, 16), 0)>
<19, (11, 14), 15)>

Thus, the number of chordless cycles found is [12].
