Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 6, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles in the graph of length 4 or more. We will identify them first:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 1 - 9 - 8 - 0 (Chords: (1, 8))
- Cycle 2: 2 - 8 - 9 - 3 - 2 (Chords: (3, 9))
- Cycle 3: 5 - 1 - 2 - 8 - 5 (Chords: (1, 8))
- Cycle 4: 6 - 7 - 5 - 3 - 6 (Chords: (5, 3))

Step 2: 
We will check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 1 - 9 - 8 - 0 has exactly one chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 2: 2 - 8 - 9 - 3 - 2 has exactly one chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 3: 5 - 1 - 2 - 8 - 5 has exactly one chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 4: 6 - 7 - 5 - 3 - 6 has exactly one chord (5, 3)

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 5, 1, 9, 8> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <2, 8, 9, 3, 2> (Chord: (3, 9))
- <5, 1, 2, 8, 5> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <6, 7, 5, 3, 6> (Chord: (5, 3))
