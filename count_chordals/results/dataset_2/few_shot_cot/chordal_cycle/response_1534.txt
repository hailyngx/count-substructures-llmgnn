Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <5, 15, 11, 10>
- <12, 1, 6, 7>
- <5, 15, 11, 2>
- <4, 16, 8, 17>
- <2, 18, 16, 4>
- <9, 6, 1, 12>
- <6, 1, 14, 3>
- <16, 4, 9, 12>
- <14, 13, 16, 8>
- <6, 9, 4, 16>
- <6, 1, 12, 19>
- <12, 19, 5, 15>
- <0, 4, 9, 12>
- <17, 8, 16, 2>
  
Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 4, 16, 13> with chord (4, 16)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
