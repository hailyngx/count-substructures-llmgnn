Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- <0, 7, 2, 5>
- <0, 7, 2, 11>
- <0, 7, 9, 11>
- <0, 7, 9, 8>
- <0, 11, 3, 5>
- <0, 11, 2, 5>
- <0, 11, 2, 7>
- <0, 11, 2, 12>
- <0, 11, 14, 5>
- <1, 8, 14, 13>
- <2, 7, 4, 10>
- <2, 7, 11, 6>
- <2, 7, 9, 11>
- <2, 7, 9, 8>
- <2, 11, 6, 12>
- <2, 11, 3, 5>
- <2, 11, 14, 13>
- <3, 11, 14, 5>
- <5, 3, 11, 6>
- <5, 3, 0, 7>
- <5, 12, 6, 11>
- <5, 12, 2, 7>
- <5, 12, 2, 11>
- <6, 11, 3, 0>
- <6, 11, 14, 5>
- <8, 4, 7, 9>
- <8, 4, 10, 7>
- <8, 9, 7, 2>
- <8, 1, 13, 12>
- <9, 7, 2, 11>
- <9, 7, 4, 8>
- <9, 11, 2, 7>
- <9, 11, 3, 0>
- <10, 4, 7, 2>
- <11, 14, 13, 1>
- <12, 13, 1, 8>
- <12, 13, 14, 6>
- <12, 5, 2, 7>
- <13, 14, 5, 12>
- <13, 14, 11, 2>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) in each cycle:
- <0, 7, 2, 11> (Chord: (7, 11))
- <0, 11, 2, 5> (Chord: (0, 5))
- <1, 8, 14, 13> (Chord: (8, 13))
- <2, 7, 4, 10> (Chord: (7, 4))
- <2, 11, 6, 12> (Chord: (11, 6))
- <5, 12, 2, 7> (Chord: (12, 7))
- <8, 4, 7, 9> (Chord: (4, 9))
- <9, 7, 2, 11> (Chord: (7, 11))
- <10, 4, 7, 2> (Chord: (4, 2))
- <11, 14, 13, 1> (Chord: (14, 1))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [10]
