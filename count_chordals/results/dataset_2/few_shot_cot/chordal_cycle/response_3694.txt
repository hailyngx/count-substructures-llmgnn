Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 1, 0, 4, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 3, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 4: <9, 6, 4, 3, 9>
- Cycle 5: <9, 3, 1, 5, 9>
- Cycle 6: <4, 0, 1, 6, 4>
- Cycle 7: <4, 3, 5, 1, 4>
- Cycle 8: <7, 4, 0, 8, 7>
- Cycle 9: <7, 9, 6, 4, 7>
- Cycle 10: <6, 1, 5, 9, 6>
- Cycle 11: <2, 5, 9, 3, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 1, 5> - Chord: (6, 1)
- Cycle 2: <5, 1, 0, 4, 5> - Chord: (0, 4)
- Cycle 3: <5, 3, 4, 7, 5> - Chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 4: <9, 6, 4, 3, 9> - Chord: (4, 3)
- Cycle 5: <9, 3, 1, 5, 9> - Chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 6: <4, 0, 1, 6, 4> - Chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 7: <4, 3, 5, 1, 4> - Chord: (5, 1)
- Cycle 8: <7, 4, 0, 8, 7> - Chord: (0, 8)
- Cycle 9: <7, 9, 6, 4, 7> - Chord: (6, 4)
- Cycle 10: <6, 1, 5, 9, 6> - Chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 11: <2, 5, 9, 3, 2> - Chord: (9, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are [11] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
