Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 19, 23, 14, 4> has a chord 23-14
- <0, 6, 1, 12, 26> has a chord 1-26
- <0, 15, 22, 14, 4> has a chord 22-14
- <1, 12, 26, 20, 13> has a chord 26-13
- <2, 13, 21, 4, 14> has a chord 13-4
- <2, 17, 18, 5, 10> has a chord 17-5
- <4, 14, 23, 19, 0> has a chord 14-19
- <5, 10, 27, 28, 1> has a chord 10-28
- <6, 25, 11, 23, 24> has a chord 25-23
- <7, 14, 23, 19, 0> has a chord 14-19
- <9, 16, 17, 2, 21> has a chord 16-2
- <19, 23, 14, 4, 21> has a chord 23-4
- <22, 29, 3, 29, 26> has a chord 29-3
- <25, 11, 23, 14, 4> has a chord 11-14

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There are 49 cycles in total and 14 of them have exactly one chord. So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [35].
