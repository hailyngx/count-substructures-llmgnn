Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <0, 4, 1, 6, 0>
2. <0, 4, 2, 6, 0>
3. <0, 5, 2, 6, 0>
4. <0, 5, 3, 6, 0>
5. <0, 9, 4, 1, 0>
6. <0, 9, 4, 2, 0>
7. <0, 9, 7, 0, 5>
8. <1, 6, 5, 0, 1>
9. <1, 6, 5, 3, 1>
10. <1, 9, 4, 0, 1>
11. <1, 9, 7, 0, 1>
12. <2, 6, 5, 0, 2>
13. <2, 6, 5, 3, 2>
14. <2, 4, 9, 0, 2>
15. <3, 5, 0, 8, 3>
16. <3, 5, 6, 1, 3>
17. <3, 8, 0, 1, 3>
18. <4, 0, 5, 6, 4>
19. <4, 1, 6, 5, 4>
20. <4, 2, 6, 5, 4>
21. <7, 0, 5, 6, 7>
22. <9, 0, 5, 6, 9>
23. <9, 4, 1, 6, 9>
24. <9, 4, 2, 6, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Out of the listed cycles, the following cycles have exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 1, 6, 0> with chord: (0, 1)
- <0, 5, 3, 6, 0> with chord: (0, 3)
- <1, 6, 5, 0, 1> with chord: (1, 5)
- <1, 9, 7, 0, 1> with chord: (1, 7)
- <2, 6, 5, 0, 2> with chord: (2, 5)
- <3, 5, 0, 8, 3> with chord: (3, 8)
- <4, 1, 6, 5, 4> with chord: (4, 6)
- <4, 2, 6, 5, 4> with chord: (4, 6)
- <9, 4, 1, 6, 9> with chord: (4, 6)
- <9, 4, 2, 6, 9> with chord: (4, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
Thus, there are [10] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.
