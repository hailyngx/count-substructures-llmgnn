Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 6, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 9, 7, 1, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 9, 7, 6, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 5, 9, 7, 2, 4, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 5, 9, 8, 3, 1, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 5, 9, 8, 3, 1, 2, 4, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 5, 9, 8, 4, 2, 1, 0)
- Cycle 8: (0, 5, 9, 8, 4, 7, 6, 0)
- Cycle 9: (0, 5, 9, 8, 6, 7, 2, 4, 0)
- Cycle 10: (0, 5, 9, 7, 6, 8, 4, 0)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 is chordal with chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 2 is chordal with chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 3 is chordal with chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 4 is chordal with chord (7, 2)
- Cycle 5 is chordal with chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 6 is chordal with chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 7 is chordal with chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 8 is chordal with chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 9 is chordal with chord (7, 6)
- Cycle 10 is chordal with chord (6, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, (5, 6)>
<0, (9, 1)>
<0, (7, 2)>
<0, (1, 3)>
<0, (1, 2)>
<0, (2, 7)>
<0, (6, 8)>
<0, (7, 6)>
<0, (6, 8)>
