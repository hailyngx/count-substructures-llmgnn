Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 5, 9, 1, 0>
- Cycle <0, 5, 6, 7, 0>
- Cycle <0, 5, 4, 7, 0>
- Cycle <0, 9, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle <1, 9, 5, 6, 1>
- Cycle <1, 9, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle <1, 3, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle <2, 6, 5, 4, 2>
- Cycle <2, 6, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle <2, 8, 4, 7, 2>
- Cycle <3, 1, 9, 5, 3>
- Cycle <3, 1, 0, 7, 3>
- Cycle <4, 5, 6, 7, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 5, 9, 1, 0>: Chord (5, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 5, 6, 7, 0>: Chord (5, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 5, 4, 7, 0>: Chord (5, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 9, 7, 4, 0>: Chord (9, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 5, 6, 1>: Chord (9, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 7, 4, 1>: Chord (9, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 3, 7, 4, 1>: Chord (3, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 6, 5, 4, 2>: Chord (6, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 6, 7, 4, 2>: Chord (6, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 8, 4, 7, 2>: Chord (8, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 1, 0, 7, 3>: Chord (1, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, 5, 6, 7, 4>: Chord (5, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
