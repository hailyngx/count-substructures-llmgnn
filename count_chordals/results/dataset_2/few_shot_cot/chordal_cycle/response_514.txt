Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 4, 3, 1, 6>
- <0, 4, 3, 7, 5>
- <0, 4, 7, 5, 6>
- <0, 4, 7, 9, 1>
- <0, 5, 7, 4, 3>
- <1, 3, 4, 7, 5>
- <1, 3, 7, 5, 6>
- <1, 6, 5, 8, 9>
- <1, 9, 7, 5, 6>
- <2, 3, 4, 7, 5>
- <2, 5, 7, 4, 0>
- <3, 4, 7, 5, 6>
- <4, 7, 5, 8, 9>
- <5, 7, 4, 0, 6>
- <6, 1, 3, 4, 7>
- <6, 1, 9, 7, 5>
- <6, 5, 7, 4, 0>
- <7, 4, 0, 6, 5>
- <7, 4, 3, 1, 6>
- <7, 4, 3, 2, 5>
- <7, 5, 8, 9, 1>
- <9, 1, 3, 4, 7>
- <9, 1, 6, 5, 7>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, (3, 7), 5>
- <1, (3, 7), 5>
- <1, (6, 9), 7>
- <2, (3, 7), 5>
- <4, (3, 7), 5>
- <5, (4, 7), 8>
- <6, (1, 9), 7>
- <7, (4, 0), 6>
- <9, (1, 3), 7>

Step 3:
Number of chordless 4-cycles: [0] 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [9].
