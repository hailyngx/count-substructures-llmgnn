Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 5, 9, 7, 0>
- <0, 5, 4, 7, 0>
- <0, 5, 2, 7, 0>
- <2, 5, 4, 7, 2>
- <2, 5, 6, 7, 2>
- <3, 9, 7, 4, 3>
- <3, 9, 5, 2, 3>
- <4, 5, 2, 7, 4>
- <5, 2, 7, 4, 5>
- <5, 4, 7, 9, 5>
- <5, 4, 3, 9, 5>
- <5, 4, 3, 2, 5>
- <5, 9, 3, 4, 5>
- <5, 9, 7, 4, 5>
- <6, 5, 9, 7, 6>
- <7, 9, 5, 4, 7>
- <8, 5, 2, 7, 8>
- <9, 5, 4, 7, 9>
- <9, 5, 2, 3, 9>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 5, 9, 7, 0> (Chord: (5, 7))
- <0, 5, 4, 7, 0> (Chord: (5, 7))
- <2, 5, 4, 7, 2> (Chord: (5, 7))
- <2, 5, 6, 7, 2> (Chord: (5, 7))
- <3, 9, 7, 4, 3> (Chord: (9, 4))
- <3, 9, 5, 2, 3> (Chord: (9, 2))
- <5, 4, 3, 9, 5> (Chord: (4, 9))
- <6, 5, 9, 7, 6> (Chord: (5, 7))
- <7, 9, 5, 4, 7> (Chord: (9, 4))
- <8, 5, 2, 7, 8> (Chord: (5, 7))

Step 3:
Count of chordless 4-cycles: [0]
