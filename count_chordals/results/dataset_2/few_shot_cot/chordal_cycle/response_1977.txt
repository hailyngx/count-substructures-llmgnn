Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 4, 9, 6, 0>
2. <0, 4, 8, 6, 0>
3. <0, 4, 1, 5, 2, 0>
4. <0, 4, 1, 7, 3, 8, 0>
5. <1, 7, 6, 9, 4, 1>
6. <2, 5, 1, 7, 3, 8, 6, 2>
7. <3, 7, 1, 5, 2, 6, 8, 3>
8. <4, 9, 6, 8, 4>
9. <5, 1, 4, 9, 6, 2, 5>
10. <6, 9, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6>
11. <7, 1, 4, 0, 6, 8, 3, 7>
12. <8, 6, 9, 4, 1, 0, 8>
13. <9, 4, 1, 7, 3, 8, 6, 9>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 4, 9, 6, 0>
- <0, 4, 1, 5, 2, 0>
- <1, 7, 6, 9, 4, 1>
- <3, 7, 1, 5, 2, 6, 8, 3>

Step 3:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [4].
