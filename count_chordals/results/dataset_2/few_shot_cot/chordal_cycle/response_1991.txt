Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 3, 9>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 5, 8>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 7, 9>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 4, 8>
- Cycle 5: <0, 7, 2, 11>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 9, 7>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 13, 10>
- Cycle 8: <1, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 9: <2, 1, 5, 8>
- Cycle 10: <2, 11, 14, 10>
- Cycle 11: <3, 9, 7, 6>
- Cycle 12: <3, 8, 12, 13>
- Cycle 13: <3, 10, 14, 11>
- Cycle 14: <4, 8, 5, 0>
- Cycle 15: <4, 8, 6, 7>
- Cycle 16: <4, 8, 12, 13>
- Cycle 17: <5, 8, 12, 13>
- Cycle 18: <6, 7, 2, 11>
- Cycle 19: <6, 4, 13, 10>
- Cycle 20: <9, 3, 13, 12>
- Cycle 21: <9, 7, 0, 5>
- Cycle 22: <10, 3, 13, 4>
- Cycle 23: <10, 9, 7, 0>
- Cycle 24: <11, 2, 7, 0>
- Cycle 25: <11, 2, 12, 8>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
Among the listed cycles, there are no chordal 4-cycles. 

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
As there are no chordal 4-cycles in the graph, the count is [0].
