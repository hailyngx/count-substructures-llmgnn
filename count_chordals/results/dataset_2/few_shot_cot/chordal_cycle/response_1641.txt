Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 15, 1, 18, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 15, 11, 12, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 15, 11, 12, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 6, 9, 3, 2)
- Cycle 5: (3, 9, 6, 2, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 9, 19, 16, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 13, 10, 7, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 11, 12, 15, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 5, 17, 7, 4)
- Cycle 10: (5, 18, 1, 15, 5)
- Cycle 11: (7, 10, 15, 1, 7)
- Cycle 12: (8, 7, 10, 13, 8)
- Cycle 13: (9, 6, 2, 8, 9)
- Cycle 14: (9, 19, 13, 3, 9)
- Cycle 15: (10, 15, 0, 12, 10)
- Cycle 16: (11, 12, 15, 1, 11)
- Cycle 17: (13, 10, 7, 17, 13)
- Cycle 18: (13, 19, 16, 19, 13)
- Cycle 19: (15, 0, 18, 5, 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, (5, 17), 7> with chord 17 is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 18.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
