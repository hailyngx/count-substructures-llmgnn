Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 9) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, 7, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <1, 5, 4, 9, 3>
- Cycle 2: <3, 6, 4, 5, 1>
- Cycle 3: <5, 7, 6, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <6, 8, 7, 5, 3>
- Cycle 5: <8, 0, 2, 7, 5>
- Cycle 6: <9, 3, 1, 5, 4>

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord <3, 9>
- Cycle 2 has one chord <4, 6>
- Cycle 3 has one chord <0, 5>
- Cycle 4 has one chord <7, 6>
- Cycle 5 has one chord <2, 8>
- Cycle 6 has one chord <1, 5>

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
As each of the cycles found has exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [6].
