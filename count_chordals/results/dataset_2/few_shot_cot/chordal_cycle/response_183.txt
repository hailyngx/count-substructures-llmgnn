Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 3, 4, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 8, 1, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 2, 4, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 3, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 6: <5, 3, 8, 9, 5>
- Cycle 7: <5, 8, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle 8: <9, 6, 4, 3, 9>
- Cycle 9: <9, 6, 1, 8, 9>
- Cycle 10: <9, 6, 7, 1, 9>
- Cycle 11: <9, 6, 0, 4, 9>
- Cycle 12: <6, 1, 8, 5, 6>
- Cycle 13: <6, 1, 7, 9, 6>
- Cycle 14: <1, 7, 6, 9, 1>
- Cycle 15: <3, 5, 9, 8, 3>
- Cycle 16: <3, 5, 9, 6, 3>
- Cycle 17: <3, 4, 2, 9, 3>
- Cycle 18: <3, 4, 6, 9, 3>
- Cycle 19: <4, 6, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 20: <4, 6, 0, 2, 4>
- Cycle 21: <6, 9, 8, 5, 6>
- Cycle 22: <6, 9, 2, 4, 6>
- Cycle 23: <6, 7, 1, 9, 6>
- Cycle 24: <6, 7, 1, 8, 6>
- Cycle 25: <6, 7, 1, 0, 6>
- Cycle 26: <6, 0, 4, 9, 6>
- Cycle 27: <0, 4, 6, 9, 0>
- Cycle 28: <0, 4, 3, 5, 0>
- Cycle 29: <0, 4, 2, 9, 0>
- Cycle 30: <0, 8, 5, 6, 0>
- Cycle 31: <0, 8, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle 32: <0, 8, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 33: <0, 1, 6, 7, 0>
- Cycle 34: <0, 1, 7, 6, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycles:
    <5, 9, 6, 1, 5> (Chord: (6, 1))
    <5, 9, 3, 4, 5> (Chord: (9, 4))
    <5, 9, 8, 1, 5> (Chord: (9, 1))
    <5, 3, 4, 6, 5> (Chord: (3, 6))
    <5, 3, 8, 9, 5> (Chord: (5, 9))
    <5, 8, 9, 6, 5> (Chord: (9, 6))
    <9, 6, 4, 3, 9> (Chord: (6, 3))
    <9, 6, 1, 8, 9> (Chord: (6, 8))
    <6, 1, 8, 5, 6> (Chord: (1, 5))
    <3, 5, 9, 8, 3> (Chord: (5, 8))
    <4, 6, 9, 8, 4> (Chord: (6, 8))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the count is [11].
