Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 0: 0-9-7-5-0
- Cycle 1: 0-9-6-4-13-7-0
- Cycle 2: 0-9-6-5-12-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-9-6-2-13-4-0
- Cycle 4: 0-9-6-8-12-7-0
- Cycle 5: 0-1-0
- Cycle 6: 0-5-7-12-0
- Cycle 7: 4-13-7-12-4
- Cycle 8: 4-13-2-6-4
- Cycle 9: 3-10-13-4-3
- Cycle 10: 3-10-13-2-6-3
- Cycle 11: 3-10-5-12-3
- Cycle 12: 3-12-7-9-3
- Cycle 13: 7-13-2-6-7
- Cycle 14: 7-13-4-6-7
- Cycle 15: 5-12-7-13-5

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, (9, 7), 5, 0>
- <1, (0, 9), 0>
- <2, (6, 2), 4>
- <4, (13, 2), 7>
- <6, (10, 3), 4>
- <9, (6, 8), 7>
- <10, (13, 4), 3>
- <11, (3, 6), 12>
- <13, (6, 4), 7>
- <14, (12, 3), 5>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [10]
