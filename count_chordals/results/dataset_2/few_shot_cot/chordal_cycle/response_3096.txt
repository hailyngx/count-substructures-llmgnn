Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 1

Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Let's follow the steps to find the number of chordal 4-cycles in this given graph:

**Step 1:** List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycles of length 4 are: 
    - Cycle 1: (1, 4, 6, 7, 1)
    - Cycle 2: (2, 4, 1, 9, 2)
    - Cycle 3: (2, 4, 6, 3, 2)
    - Cycle 4: (2, 4, 1, 7, 2)
    - Cycle 5: (3, 6, 7, 1, 3)
    - Cycle 6: (3, 8, 7, 1, 3)

**Step 2:** Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The chordal 4-cycle found is: <2, (1, 7), 4>

**Step 3:** Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 5 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
