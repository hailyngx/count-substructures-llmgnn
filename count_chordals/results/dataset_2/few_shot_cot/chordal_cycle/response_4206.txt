Node 6 is connected to node 10, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 14, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 4, 2, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 10, 4, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, 6, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 3, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are found by looking at the adjacency list of each node. Some of the cycles include:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 14, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 3: <2, 12, 4, 8, 2>
- Cycle 4: <2, 5, 7, 14, 13, 3, 11, 2>

Step 2: Checking for the chord in each cycle:
- For Cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 1, 0> does not have a chord.
- For Cycle 2: <0, 14, 7, 1, 0> does not have a chord.
- For Cycle 3: <2, 12, 4, 8, 2> does not have a chord.
- For Cycle 4: <2, 5, 7, 14, 13, 3, 11, 2> has a chord (3, 13).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
As we found 3 chordless cycles, the final count is [3]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycle is <2, 5, 7, 14, 13, 3, 11, 2> with a chord (3, 13).
