Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 6, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 3, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
<0, 2, 4, 8>
<0, 2, 8, 1>
<0, 5, 4, 8>
<0, 5, 7, 8>
<0, 6, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 1, 8>
<1, 8, 4, 9>
<1, 8, 7, 9>
<1, 6, 4, 9>
<1, 6, 3, 9>
<3, 4, 8, 9>
<3, 4, 5, 9>
<3, 6, 4, 9>
<3, 6, 1, 9>
<4, 8, 7, 9>
<4, 9, 7, 5>
<5, 4, 8, 7>
<5, 7, 8, 4>
<5, 7, 9, 4>
<5, 7, 1, 8>
<7, 8, 4, 9>
<7, 9, 4, 5>

Step 2: 

The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
<0, (5, 7), 8>
<0, (6, 1), 8>
<1, (6, 4), 9>
<3, (6, 1), 9>

Step 3:

The number of chordless cycles is [20].
