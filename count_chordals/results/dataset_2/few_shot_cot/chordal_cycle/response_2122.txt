<0, 17, 20, 19> - Chord: (17, 19)
<0, 17, 26, 25> - Chord: (17, 25)
<0, 17, 26, 10> - Chord: (17, 10)
<0, 17, 26, 27> - Chord: (17, 27)
<0, 18, 7, 8> - Chord: (18, 8)
<0, 18, 7, 25> - Chord: (18, 25)
<0, 18, 7, 19> - Chord: (18, 19)
<0, 18, 7, 21> - Chord: (18, 21)
<0, 18, 12, 3> - Chord: (18, 3)
<0, 18, 12, 11> - Chord: (18, 11)
<0, 18, 12, 21> - Chord: (18, 21)
<0, 18, 19, 6> - Chord: (18, 6)
<0, 18, 19, 20> - Chord: (18, 20)
<0, 18, 19, 4> - Chord: (18, 4)
<0, 18, 19, 21> - Chord: (18, 21)
<0, 18, 19, 18> - Chord: (18, 18)
<1, 23, 4, 14> - Chord: (23, 4)
