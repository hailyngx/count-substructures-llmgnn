Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is:

<7, 4, 11, 2>

Following the steps provided earlier:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle with nodes 7, 4, 11, 2
- Cycle with nodes 15, 16, 1, 18
- Cycle with nodes 16, 1, 8, 6
- Cycle with nodes 18, 17, 8, 6
- Cycle with nodes 18, 1, 6, 9
- Cycle with nodes 18, 17, 8, 1
- Cycle with nodes 17, 8, 6, 9
- Cycle with nodes 16, 15, 9, 6
- Cycle with nodes 16, 14, 10, 15
- Cycle with nodes 10, 7, 13, 4
- Cycle with nodes 10, 14, 16, 15
- Cycle with nodes 10, 7, 12, 5
- Cycle with nodes 9, 6, 8, 1
- Cycle with nodes 9, 15, 16, 1
- Cycle with nodes 7, 12, 2, 11
- Cycle with nodes 7, 12, 5, 11
- Cycle with nodes 7, 3, 4, 13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Among these cycles, <7, 4, 11, 2> is the only cycle with exactly one chord, which is the edge between nodes 4 and 2.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle in the graph, the count is [1].
