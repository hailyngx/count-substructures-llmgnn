Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <5, 9, 0, 4, 5>
- <5, 9, 1, 5>
- <5, 3, 7, 8, 5>
- <9, 5, 4, 0, 9>
- <9, 5, 3, 7, 9>
- <1, 5, 9, 0, 1>
- <3, 5, 9, 4, 3>
- <4, 5, 3, 7, 4>
- <8, 1, 5, 3, 8>
- <0, 9, 5, 1, 0>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 1, 5> has one chord: (5, 1)
- <9, 5, 4, 0, 9> has one chord: (9, 4)
- <9, 5, 3, 7, 9> has one chord: (9, 3)
- <1, 5, 9, 0, 1> has one chord: (1, 9)
- <3, 5, 9, 4, 3> has one chord: (3, 9)
- <4, 5, 3, 7, 4> has one chord: (4, 3)
- <8, 1, 5, 3, 8> has one chord: (8, 3)
- <0, 9, 5, 1, 0> has one chord: (0, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].
