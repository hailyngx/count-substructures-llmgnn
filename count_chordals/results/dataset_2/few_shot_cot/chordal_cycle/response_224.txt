Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 9, 2, 6, 1> with chords (9, 6)
- <0, 9, 3, 4, 7> with chords (9, 7)
- <0, 4, 7, 8>
- <1, 6, 5, 4, 7> with chords (6, 4)
- <2, 6, 5, 4, 7> with chords (6, 4)
- <2, 9, 7, 4, 5> with chords (9, 7)
- <4, 7, 5, 2, 6> with chords (7, 2)
- <5, 6, 2, 9, 7> with chords (6, 9)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 2, 6, 1> is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (9, 6)
- <0, 9, 3, 4, 7> is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (9, 7)
- <1, 6, 5, 4, 7> is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord (6, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal cycles found: [3]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, 9, 2, 6, 1> with chord (9, 6)
- <0, 9, 3, 4, 7> with chord (9, 7)
- <1, 6, 5, 4, 7> with chord (6, 4)
