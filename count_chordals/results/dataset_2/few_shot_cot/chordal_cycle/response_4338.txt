Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 23, 7, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 16, 23, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 21, 29, 11, 25, 6, 20, 2, 7, 15, 9, 16, 23, 8, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 29, 11, 25, 6, 28, 12, 26, 20, 2, 7, 15, 9, 16, 23, 8, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 10, 22, 18, 3, 17, 24, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 7, 15, 9, 10, 22, 18, 3, 5, 13, 20, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 17, 10, 9, 15, 7, 23, 8, 4, 3>
- Cycle 8: <4, 8, 16, 9, 15, 7, 23, 22, 18, 3, 5, 13, 20, 6, 25, 11, 29, 0, 21, 4>
- Cycle 9: <6, 25, 13, 5, 3, 18, 22, 10, 9, 15, 7, 23, 8, 16, 9, 12, 28, 6>
- Cycle 10: <7, 23, 16, 9, 15, 7>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle.
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: Chord (0, 23), Chord (8, 7)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: Chord (8, 16)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: Chord (11, 25)
- Cycle 4 has 0 chords
- Cycle 5 has 0 chords
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: Chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 7 has 0 chords
- Cycle 8 has 0 chords
- Cycle 9 has 0 chords
- Cycle 10 has 0 chords

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<0, (8, 16), 23, 7)> 
<0, (29, 11), 25, 6, 28, 12, 26, 20), (2, 7)> 
<1, 10, (22, 18), 3, 17, 24)> 
<2, 7, 15, (9, 10), 22, 18, 3, 5, 13, 20)> 
<3, 17, 10, (9, 15), 7, 23, 8, 4)> 
<6, 25, 13, 5, 3, 18, 22, 10, 9, 15, 7, (23, 8), 16, 9, 12, 28)> 
<7, 23, 16, 9, 15, 7>
