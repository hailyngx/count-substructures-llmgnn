Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 3, 14, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 12, 0, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 11, 2, 7, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 5, 4, 7, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 2, 7, 13, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 11, 10, 2, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 6, 12, 5, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 0, 12, 5, 4)
- Cycle 10: (7, 4, 5, 9, 7)
- Cycle 11: (7, 6, 5, 9, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 2, 9, 5, 7)
- Cycle 13: (10, 11, 2, 7, 10)
- Cycle 14: (10, 13, 1, 2, 10)
- Cycle 15: (3, 4, 5, 9, 3)
- Cycle 16: (0, 9, 5, 4, 0)
- Cycle 17: (0, 12, 6, 5, 0)
- Cycle 18: (1, 2, 9, 5, 1)
- Cycle 19: (1, 14, 3, 4, 1)
- Cycle 20: (14, 10, 11, 5, 14)
- Cycle 21: (14, 8, 2, 9, 14)
- Cycle 22: (14, 1, 13, 10, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <5, 4, 3, 14>
- <5, 4, 6, 7>
- <5, 6, 12, 0>
- <5, 11, 2, 7>
- <9, 5, 4, 7>
- <9, 2, 7, 13>
- <4, 11, 10, 2>
- <4, 6, 12, 5>
- <4, 0, 12, 5>
- <7, 2, 9, 5>
- <10, 11, 2, 7>
- <10, 13, 1, 2>
- <3, 4, 5, 9>
- <0, 9, 5, 4>
- <0, 12, 6, 5>
- <1, 2, 9, 5>
- <1, 14, 3, 4>
- <14, 10, 11, 5>
- <14, 8, 2, 9>
- <14, 1, 13, 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are [20] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
