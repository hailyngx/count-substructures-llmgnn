Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. (0, 5, 1, 9)
2. (0, 5, 7, 4)
3. (0, 5, 7, 2)
4. (0, 5, 9, 8)
5. (1, 5, 9, 3)
6. (1, 5, 2, 7)
7. (1, 9, 8, 2)
8. (2, 5, 9, 8)
9. (2, 5, 7, 0)
10. (2, 9, 8, 3)
11. (3, 9, 8, 2)
12. (3, 9, 5, 7)
13. (4, 7, 5, 9)
14. (6, 3, 9, 8)
15. (6, 3, 4, 7)
16. (7, 5, 1, 9)
17. (7, 5, 2, 9)
18. (7, 4, 3, 9)
19. (8, 9, 3, 6)

Step 2: 
Checking for a chord in each cycle:
1. (0, 5, 1, 9) - Chord: (1, 9)
2. (0, 5, 7, 4) - Chord: (0, 7)
3. (0, 5, 7, 2) - Chord: (2, 7)
4. (0, 5, 9, 8) - Chord: (5, 9)
5. (1, 5, 9, 3) - Chord: (5, 9)
6. (1, 5, 2, 7) - Chord: (1, 7)
7. (1, 9, 8, 2) - Chord: (2, 8)
8. (2, 5, 9, 8) - Chord: (5, 8)
9. (2, 5, 7, 0) - Chord: (0, 7)
10. (2, 9, 8, 3) - Chord: (2, 8)
11. (3, 9, 8, 2) - Chord: (8, 9)
12. (3, 9, 5, 7) - Chord: (5, 7)
13. (4, 7, 5, 9) - Chord: (5, 7)
14. (6, 3, 9, 8) - Chord: (3, 9)
15. (6, 3, 4, 7) - Chord: (3, 4)
16. (7, 5, 1, 9) - Chord: (5, 9)
17. (7, 5, 2, 9) - Chord: (5, 9)
18. (7, 4, 3, 9) - Chord: (4, 9)
19. (8, 9, 3, 6) - Chord: (9, 3)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [19]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, 7, 5, 9>
