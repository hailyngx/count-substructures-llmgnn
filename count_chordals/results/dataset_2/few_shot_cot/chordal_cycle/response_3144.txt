Response:
Step 1: 
- We identify the following cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <0, 3, 1, 11>
2. <0, 4, 8, 10>
3. <0, 4, 5, 13>
4. <0, 4, 6, 5>
5. <0, 4, 6, 7>
6. <0, 12, 5, 13>
7. <0, 12, 14, 3>
8. <1, 3, 14, 13>
9. <1, 10, 12, 4>
10. <1, 10, 9, 8>
11. <1, 11, 7, 13>
12. <2, 6, 7, 11>
13. <2, 6, 4, 8>
14. <4, 6, 5, 13>
15. <4, 6, 7, 5>
16. <5, 7, 13, 14>
17. <8, 9, 10, 12>
18. <10, 12, 4, 0>

Step 2:
- Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
1. <0, 3, 1, 11> with chord (1, 11)
2. <1, 10, 12, 4> with chord (10, 12)
3. <1, 10, 9, 8> with chord (10, 9)
4. <4, 6, 5, 13> with chord (6, 5)
5. <8, 9, 10, 12> with chord (9, 10)

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [13]
