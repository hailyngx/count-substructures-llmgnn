Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 16) (17, 9) (17, 2) (1, 14) (1, 3) (1, 16) (1, 19) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (10, 5) (11, 19) (11, 4) (11, 15) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 15) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 18) (7, 14) (7, 13) (12, 6) (5, 10) (5, 8) (5, 13) (5, 0) (13, 17) (13, 7) (13, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 16) (16, 17) (16, 1) (16, 0) (16, 18) (19, 1) (19, 11) (19, 9) (2, 17) (2, 6) (2, 15) (9, 17) (9, 19) (15, 11) (15, 4) (15, 2) (15, 6) (18, 8) (18, 16) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 2) (6, 15)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 16, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 13, 7, 14, 1, 3, 6, 12, 6, 2, 17, 16, 0>
- Cycle 3: <4, 11, 19, 1, 14, 7, 13, 5, 8, 4>
- Cycle 4: <4, 11, 19, 9, 17, 13, 5, 8, 18, 16, 2, 15, 6, 3, 1, 0, 16, 18, 8>
- Cycle 5: <8, 18, 16, 0, 1, 14, 7, 13, 5, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord <1, 16>.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has one chord <19, 1>.
- Cycle 4 has one chord <19, 9>.
- Cycle 5 has one chord <18, 16>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 1 chordless cycle found, so the final number is [1].
