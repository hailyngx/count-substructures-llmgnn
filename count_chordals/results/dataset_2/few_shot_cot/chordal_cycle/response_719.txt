Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 9 - 8 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 4 - 7 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 3: 2 - 4 - 8 - 9 - 2
- Cycle 4: 3 - 9 - 8 - 4 - 3

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord (9, 4)
- Cycle 2 has chord (4, 6)
- Cycle 3 has chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 4 has chord (9, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 9, 8, 4, (9, 4)>
<1, 4, 7, 6, (4, 6)>
<2, 4, 8, 9, (4, 9)>
<3, 9, 8, 4, (9, 4)>
