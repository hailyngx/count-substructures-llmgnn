Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 2>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 2>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 7, 1>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 2, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 2, 9, 6>
- Cycle 6: <1, 2, 3, 4>
- Cycle 7: <1, 2, 8, 5>
- Cycle 8: <1, 5, 8, 6>
- Cycle 9: <2, 3, 4, 5>
- Cycle 10: <2, 3, 6, 7>
- Cycle 11: <4, 5, 8, 6>
- Cycle 12: <5, 8, 6, 1>
- Cycle 13: <6, 7, 2, 9>
- Cycle 14: <6, 7, 1, 5>
- Cycle 15: <8, 6, 9, 2>
- Cycle 16: <9, 2, 3, 4>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
    <0, 5, 8, 2> (Chord: (0, 8))

Step 3:
Final number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
