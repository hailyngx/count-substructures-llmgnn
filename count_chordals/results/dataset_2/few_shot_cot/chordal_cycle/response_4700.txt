- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 12, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 14, 12, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 4, 7, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 10, 9, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 7, 4, 12, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 7, 11, 2, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 7, 12, 9, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 12, 3, 13, 1>

- Cycle 22: <10, 6, 1, 13, 10>
- Cycle 23: <10, 14, 5, 0, 10>
  
Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 4, 12, 1, 0, (4, 12)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 6, 4, 7, 1, (6, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 12, 3, 13, 1, (3, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, 4, 7, 2, 3, (4, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, 6, 1, 13, 4, (1, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, 7, 12, 9, 4, (7, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, 7, 12, 9, 5, (7, 9)>
  
Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [7]
