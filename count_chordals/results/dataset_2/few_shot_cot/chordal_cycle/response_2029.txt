Step 2: Cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 6, 4, 1> with chord (1, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 6, 5, 1> with chord (6, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 3, 5, 6> with chord (3, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 5, 4, 9> with chord (9, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 4, 9, 8> with chord (4, 1)

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles = [25]
