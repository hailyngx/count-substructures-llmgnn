Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 14) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 12) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 0) (12, 11) (12, 6) (12, 0) (14, 10) (14, 3) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 13) (3, 14) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 9) (9, 10) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (0, 12) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, 8, 13, 4, 12, and node 1

Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, 14, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 10, 11, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 10, 2, 14, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 8, 13, 9, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 0, 8, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 11, 6, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 10, 5, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 10, 3, 1, 7, and node 9

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the provided graph is <0, 11, 12, 0>. The chord connecting non-adjacent nodes 11 and 12 is present in this cycle.

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [0].
