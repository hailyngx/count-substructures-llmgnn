Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 7 - 13 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 7 - 12 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 3: 1 - 0 - 7 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 0 - 7 - 12 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 6 - 3 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 6: 2 - 9 - 4 - 12 - 2
- Cycle 7: 2 - 9 - 5 - 14 - 2
- Cycle 8: 3 - 8 - 6 - 1 - 3
- Cycle 9: 3 - 8 - 13 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 10: 4 - 9 - 5 - 10 - 4
- Cycle 11: 5 - 9 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 12: 5 - 9 - 14 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 13: 6 - 8 - 13 - 11 - 6
- Cycle 14: 7 - 5 - 10 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 15: 7 - 9 - 2 - 13 - 7
- Cycle 16: 9 - 5 - 7 - 13 - 9

Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 6: 2 - 9 - 4 - 12 - 2 has one chord: (4, 12)

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <2, (4, 12), 9>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [15 - 1 = 14].
