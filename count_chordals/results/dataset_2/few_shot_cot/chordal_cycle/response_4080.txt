Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (10, 11) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 0) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 13) (1, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 9) (14, 10) (14, 7) (14, 4) (13, 1) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 11, and node 12

Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, 6, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 12, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 12, 4, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 10, 11, 6, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 14, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 7, 2, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 7, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 2, 6, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 1, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 4, 1, 0>
- <0, 5, 12, 2, 0>
- <0, 5, 14, 10, 0>
- <0, 9, 7, 10, 0>
- <0, 9, 14, 10, 0>
- <0, 11, 7, 10, 0>
- <1, 9, 7, 6, 1>
- <1, 9, 14, 10, 1>
- <1, 2, 10, 14, 1>
- <1, 2, 8, 6, 1>
- <2, 10, 7, 6, 2>
- <2, 12, 6, 1, 2>
- <3, 8, 2, 12, 3>
- <3, 8, 1, 6, 3>
- <4, 5, 7, 10, 4>
- <4, 14, 10, 7, 4>
- <6, 1, 9, 14, 6>
- <6, 1, 4, 14, 6>
  
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
Among the listed cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle is:
<0, 5, 14, 10, 0> with the chord (5, 14)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 17 chordless cycles found.

Final answer: [17]
