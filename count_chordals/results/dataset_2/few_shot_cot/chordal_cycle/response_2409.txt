Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. (5, 2, 4, 5)
2. (5, 7, 1, 9, 5)
3. (5, 9, 1, 7, 5)
4. (9, 6, 7, 1, 9)
5. (4, 5, 7, 6, 4)
6. (7, 5, 9, 6, 7)
7. (7, 0, 3, 2, 7)
8. (1, 9, 6, 5, 1)
9. (3, 7, 1, 9, 3)
10. (3, 0, 7, 1, 3)
11. (6, 5, 9, 1, 6)
12. (8, 4, 5, 7, 8)
13. (8, 3, 0, 7, 8)
14. (2, 5, 9, 6, 2)
15. (2, 4, 8, 3, 2)
16. (2, 3, 7, 1, 2)
17. (2, 6, 0, 7, 2)
18. (0, 7, 5, 9, 0)
19. (0, 3, 2, 5, 0)

Step 2: 
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle <5, 2, 4, 5> has a chord (2, 4).
- Cycle <5, 7, 1, 9, 5> has a chord (1, 9).
- Cycle <5, 9, 1, 7, 5> has a chord (1, 7).
- Cycle <9, 6, 7, 1, 9> has a chord (6, 7).
- Cycle <4, 5, 7, 6, 4> has a chord (7, 6).
- Cycle <7, 5, 9, 6, 7> has a chord (9, 6).
- Cycle <7, 0, 3, 2, 7> has a chord (3, 2).
- Cycle <1, 9, 6, 5, 1> has a chord (6, 5).
- Cycle <3, 7, 1, 9, 3> has a chord (1, 9).
- Cycle <3, 0, 7, 1, 3> has a chord (1, 7).
- Cycle <6, 5, 9, 1, 6> has a chord (9, 1).
- Cycle <8, 4, 5, 7, 8> has a chord (5, 7).
- Cycle <8, 3, 0, 7, 8> has a chord (3, 0).
- Cycle <2, 5, 9, 6, 2> has a chord (9, 6).
- Cycle <2, 4, 8, 3, 2> has a chord (8, 3).
- Cycle <2, 3, 7, 1, 2> has a chord (7, 1).
- Cycle <2, 6, 0, 7, 2> has a chord (0, 7).
- Cycle <0, 7, 5, 9, 0> has a chord (5, 9).

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 19 cycles in total. All cycles have at least one chord. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
