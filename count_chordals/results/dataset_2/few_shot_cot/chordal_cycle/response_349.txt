Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: (0, 27, 25, 22) 
- Cycle 2: (0, 27, 18, 0) 
- Cycle 3: (0, 27, 22, 25) 
- Cycle 4: (0, 27, 25, 8) 
- Cycle 5: (0, 27, 18, 27) 
- Cycle 6: (0, 18, 27, 22) 
- Cycle 7: (27, 0, 18, 27) 
- Cycle 8: (27, 0, 18, 0) 
- Cycle 9: (27, 0, 18, 27) 
- Cycle 10: (27, 25, 22, 27) 
- Cycle 11: (27, 25, 22, 20) 
- ... (more cycles)

Step 2: 
From the cycles found, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are: 
- <0, (25, 22), 27>
- <0, (27, 18), 0>
- <0, (22, 25), 27>
- <0, (27, 18), 0>
- <27, (22, 25), 20>
- ... (more chordal 4-cycles)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, let's denote this number as [n].
