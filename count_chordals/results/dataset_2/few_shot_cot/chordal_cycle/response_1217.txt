Step 2: Checking for a single chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 1 has chord (2, 9)
        - Cycle 2 has chord (2, 8)
        - Cycle 3 has no chords
        - Cycle 4 has chord (12, 5)
        - Cycle 5 has no chords
        - Cycle 6 has no chords
        - Cycle 7 has chord (3, 11)
        - Cycle 8 has chord (3, 10)
        - Cycle 9 has chord (3, 11)
        - Cycle 10 has no chords
        - Cycle 11 has no chords
        - Cycle 12 has no chords
        - Cycle 13 has no chords
        - Cycle 14 has chord (10, 14)
        - Cycle 15 has no chords
        - Cycle 16 has chord (3, 17)
        - Cycle 17 has no chords
        - Cycle 18 has no chords
        - Cycle 19 has no chords
        - Cycle 20 has no chords
        - Cycle 21 has no chords
        - Cycle 22 has no chords
        - Cycle 23 has chord (10, 14)
        - Cycle 24 has chord (16, 0)
        - Cycle 25 has no chords
        - Cycle 26 has no chords
        - Cycle 27 has no chords
        - Cycle 28 has no chords

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 16 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [16].
