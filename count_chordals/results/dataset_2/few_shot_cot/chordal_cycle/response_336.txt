Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (6, 26), 1> with chord (6, 26)
- <2, 2, (14, 29)> with chord (14, 29)
- <3, (11, 27), 3> with chord (11, 27)
- <4, (11, 13), 4> with chord (11, 13)
- <5, (14, 22), 5> with chord (14, 22)
- <6, (12, 18), 6> with chord (12, 18)
- <7, (6, 24), 7> with chord (6, 24)
- <8, (27, 5), 8> with chord (27, 5)
- <9, (27, 19), 9> with chord (27, 19)
- <10, (26, 12), 10> with chord (26, 12)
- <11, (21, 10), 11> with chord (21, 10)
- <12, (23, 26), 12> with chord (23, 26)
- <13, (29, 14), 13> with chord (29, 14)
- <14, (22, 14), 14> with chord (22, 14)
- <15, (23, 10), 15> with chord (23, 10)
- <16, (26, 25), 16> with chord (26, 25)
- <17, (10, 25), 17> with chord (10, 25)
- <18, (21, 3), 18> with chord (21, 3)
- <19, (28, 6), 19> with chord (28, 6)
- <20, (26, 23), 20> with chord (26, 23)
- <21, (26, 2), 21> with chord (26, 2)
- <22, (12, 13), 22> with chord (12, 13)
- <23, (7, 27), 23> with chord (7, 27)
- <24, (24, 18), 24> with chord (24, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 24 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [24].
