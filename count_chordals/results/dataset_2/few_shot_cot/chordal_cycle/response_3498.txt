Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 17, 14, 2, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 17, 11, 6, 14, 20, 29, 2, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 18, 4, 21, 9, 22, 27, 13, 11, 15, 28, 8, 4, 1)
- Cycle 4: (4, 23, 22, 9, 15, 28, 8, 27, 22)
- Cycle 5: (5, 10, 11, 17, 0, 20, 1, 5)
- Cycle 6: (6, 14, 20, 29, 2, 18, 4, 21, 9, 15, 28, 26, 7, 16, 12, 24, 5, 10, 11, 6)
- Cycle 7: (8, 4, 23, 22, 27, 13, 11, 17, 0, 7, 16, 12, 8)
- Cycle 8: (9, 15, 28, 26, 7, 0, 17, 14, 6, 11, 10, 5, 24, 12, 16, 25, 22, 23, 4, 18, 2, 29, 20, 9)
- Cycle 9: (19, 25, 22, 9, 15, 28, 26, 7, 16, 25, 19)
- Cycle 10: (21, 9, 15, 28, 8, 4, 18, 2, 29, 20, 0, 17, 11, 13, 27, 22, 23, 4, 21)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 has one chord (6, 2)
- Cycle 6 has one chord (14, 4)
- Cycle 7 has one chord (0, 16)
- Cycle 10 has one chord (17, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 17, 14, 2>
<0, 17, 11, 6, 14, 20, 29, 2>
<1, 3, 18, 4, 21, 9, 22, 27, 13, 11, 15, 28, 8, 4>
<4, 23, 22, 9, 15, 28, 8, 27>
<5, 10, 11, 17, 0, 20, 1>
<19, 25, 22, 9, 15, 28, 26, 7, 16, 25>
