Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the given graph. Let's list them:
1. Cycle 0-4-6-8-0
2. Cycle 0-4-7-5-1-0
3. Cycle 1-5-7-3-1
4. Cycle 2-4-6-8-2
5. Cycle 2-4-7-5-2
6. Cycle 2-7-5-3-2
7. Cycle 3-5-1-0-4-3
8. Cycle 3-5-7-4-0-3
9. Cycle 4-6-2-7-4
10. Cycle 5-7-3-8-5

Step 2:
Let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 0-4-6-8-0 <chord (4, 8)>
- Cycle 0-4-7-5-1-0 <no chord>
- Cycle 1-5-7-3-1 <chord (5, 3)>
- Cycle 2-4-6-8-2 <chord (4, 8)>
- Cycle 2-4-7-5-2 <no chord>
- Cycle 2-7-5-3-2 <chord (7, 3)>
- Cycle 3-5-1-0-4-3 <no chord>
- Cycle 3-5-7-4-0-3 <no chord>
- Cycle 4-6-2-7-4 <no chord>
- Cycle 5-7-3-8-5 <chord (7, 8)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, (4, 8)>
<1, (5, 3)>
<2, (4, 8)>
<5, 7, 3, 8), (7, 8)>
