Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 6, 4, 7>
- <0, 6, 8, 4>
- <0, 6, 9, 7>
- <0, 12, 9, 6>
- <0, 12, 13, 4>
- <1, 10, 14, 7>
- <2, 6, 9, 12>
- <2, 6, 9, 7>
- <2, 6, 4, 8>
- <2, 11, 3, 4>
- <2, 11, 0, 6>
- <3, 4, 13, 12>
- <3, 11, 12, 0>
- <3, 14, 7, 5>
- <4, 7, 5, 8>
- <4, 13, 12, 11>
- <5, 7, 9, 12>
- <6, 9, 12, 11>
- <6, 9, 7, 5>
- <6, 2, 8, 5>
- <7, 9, 12, 13>
- <8, 6, 9, 12>
- <8, 6, 4, 7>
- <10, 0, 12, 13>
- <10, 0, 5, 7>
- <11, 2, 13, 4>
- <11, 3, 4, 6>
- <12, 13, 2, 11>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, (6, 4), 7>
- <0, (6, 8), 4>
- <0, (6, 9), 7>
- <0, (9, 12), 6>
- <0, (12, 13), 4>
- <1, 10, 14, (7)>
- <2, (6, 9), 12>
- <2, (6, 9), 7>
- <2, (6, 4), 8>
- <2, 11, (3, 4)>
- <2, 11, (0, 6)>
- <3, 4, (13, 12)>
- <3, 11, 12, (0)>
- <3, 14, (7), 5>
- <4, 7, 5, (8)>
- <4, 13, (12, 11)>
- <5, 7, (9, 12)>
- <6, 9, (12, 11)>
- <6, 9, 7, (5)>
- <6, 2, (8), 5>
- <7, 9, 12, (13)>
- <8, 6, (9, 12)>
- <8, 6, (4, 7)>
- <10, 0, (12, 13)>
- <10, 0, 5, (7)>
- <11, 2, (13), 4>
- <11, 3, 4, (6)>
- <12, 13, 2, (11)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [2] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
