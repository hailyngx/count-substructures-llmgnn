Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- <4, 7, 5, 2>
- <1, 6, 5, 7>
- <3, 8, 6, 5>
- <9, 7, 5, 2>
- <3, 4, 1, 9>
- <8, 6, 5, 2>
- <0, 9, 7, 5>
- <8, 9, 7, 5>
- <9, 7, 4, 3>
- <0, 9, 7, 4>

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <4, 7, 5, 2>: Chord (4, 5)
- <1, 6, 5, 7>: Chord (1, 5)
- <3, 8, 6, 5>: Chord (3, 6)
- <9, 7, 5, 2>: Chord (9, 5)
- <3, 4, 1, 9>: Chord (3, 1)
- <8, 6, 5, 2>: Chord (8, 5)
- <0, 9, 7, 5>: Chord (0, 7)
- <8, 9, 7, 5>: Chord (8, 7)
- <9, 7, 4, 3>: Chord (9, 4)
- <0, 9, 7, 4>: Chord (0, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 0

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
