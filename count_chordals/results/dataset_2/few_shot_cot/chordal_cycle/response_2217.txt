Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
Based on the given graph, we can identify the following cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 5, 8, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 5, 8, 6>
- Cycle 3: <2, 4, 7, 5, 8>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 7, 5, 8>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle 7: <4, 7, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 8: <4, 7, 6, 1, 3>
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 5, 8, 6>
- Cycle 10: <7, 4, 2, 6, 1>
- Cycle 11: <7, 5, 8, 6, 1>
- Cycle 12: <5, 0, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle 13: <5, 0, 7, 6, 1>
- Cycle 14: <5, 7, 4, 2, 6>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 7, 5, 8, 4> (Chord: (5, 8))
- <0, 7, 5, 8, 6> (Chord: (5, 8))
- <4, 7, 6, 1, 5> (Chord: (7, 1))

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: [11]
