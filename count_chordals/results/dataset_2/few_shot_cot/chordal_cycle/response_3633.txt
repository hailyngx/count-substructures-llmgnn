Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
- <5, 9, 4, 8, (5, 9), (4, 8)>
- <5, 9, 3, 6, (5, 9), (3, 6)>
- <5, 7, 6, 3, (5, 7), (6, 3)>
- <1, 5, 7, 6, (1, 5), (7, 6)>
- <1, 9, 4, 8, (1, 9), (4, 8)>
- <1, 3, 6, 7, (1, 3), (6, 7)>
- <2, 6, 5, 7, (2, 6), (5, 7)>
- <2, 8, 4, 9, (2, 8), (4, 9)>
- <0, 1, 9, 3, (0, 1), (9, 3)>
- <0, 2, 8, 4, (0, 2), (8, 4)>

Step 2: 
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <5, 9, 4, 8, (5, 9), (4, 8)> has a chord (5, 4)
- <5, 9, 3, 6, (5, 9), (3, 6)> has no chord
- <5, 7, 6, 3, (5, 7), (6, 3)> has no chord
- <1, 5, 7, 6, (1, 5), (7, 6)> has no chord
- <1, 9, 4, 8, (1, 9), (4, 8)> has a chord (1, 4)
- <1, 3, 6, 7, (1, 3), (6, 7)> has a chord (1, 6)
- <2, 6, 5, 7, (2, 6), (5, 7)> has no chord
- <2, 8, 4, 9, (2, 8), (4, 9)> has a chord (2, 9)
- <0, 1, 9, 3, (0, 1), (9, 3)> has no chord
- <0, 2, 8, 4, (0, 2), (8, 4)> has a chord (0, 8)

Step 3:
Counting chordal 4-cycles: [5]
