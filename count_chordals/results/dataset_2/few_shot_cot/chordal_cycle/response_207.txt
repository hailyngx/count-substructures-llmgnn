Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 8, 4, 1, 3> with edges (0, 8), (8, 4), (4, 1), (1, 3), (3, 6), (6, 8)
- Cycle <0, 8, 11, 9, 2> with edges (0, 8), (8, 11), (11, 9), (9, 2), (2, 14), (14, 0)
- Cycle <1, 3, 6, 9, 13> with edges (1, 3), (3, 6), (6, 9), (9, 13), (13, 4), (4, 1)
- Cycle <2, 5, 7, 8, 11> with edges (2, 5), (5, 7), (7, 8), (8, 11), (11, 9), (9, 2)
- Cycle <5, 7, 2, 10, 14> with edges (5, 7), (7, 2), (2, 10), (10, 14), (14, 6), (6, 5)
- Cycle <6, 9, 11, 8, 4> with edges (6, 9), (9, 11), (11, 8), (8, 4), (4, 12), (12, 6)
- Cycle <9, 13, 4, 12, 3> with edges (9, 13), (13, 4), (4, 12), (12, 3), (3, 1), (1, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- For <0, 8, 4, 1, 3>, chords: (0, 4) 
- For <0, 8, 11, 9, 2>, chords: (8, 9)
- For <1, 3, 6, 9, 13>, chords: (1, 6)
- For <2, 5, 7, 8, 11>, chords: (5, 8)
- For <5, 7, 2, 10, 14>, chords: (7, 10)
- For <6, 9, 11, 8, 4>, chords: (9, 8)
- For <9, 13, 4, 12, 3>, chords: (13, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
