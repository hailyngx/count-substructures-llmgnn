Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 9, 6> with chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 3, 7> with chord (6, 7)
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 2, 7> with chord (6, 7)
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 3, 8> with chord (3, 8)
- Cycle 5: <0, 7, 4, 8> with chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 6: <2, 4, 7, 5> with chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 7: <2, 4, 8, 9> with chord (4, 9)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle found: 
    <0, 6, 3, 8> with chord (3, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, the final result is [1].
