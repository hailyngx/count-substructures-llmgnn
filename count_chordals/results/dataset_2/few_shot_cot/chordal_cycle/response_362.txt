Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 6, 9, 4, 0>
- Cycle <0, 6, 9, 3, 0>
- Cycle <0, 6, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle <0, 6, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle <9, 6, 4, 1, 9>
- Cycle <9, 6, 5, 7, 9>
- Cycle <5, 6, 4, 1, 5>
- Cycle <5, 6, 9, 3, 5>
- Cycle <1, 4, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle <1, 4, 6, 5, 1>
- Cycle <3, 9, 6, 4, 3>
- Cycle <3, 9, 7, 5, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 6, 9, 4, 0> has a chord (6, 4)
- <0, 6, 9, 3, 0> has a chord (6, 3)
- <0, 6, 4, 1, 0> has a chord (6, 1)
- <0, 6, 5, 7, 0> has a chord (6, 7)
- <9, 6, 4, 1, 9> has a chord (6, 1)
- <9, 6, 5, 7, 9> has a chord (6, 5)
- <5, 6, 4, 1, 5> has a chord (6, 4)
- <5, 6, 9, 3, 5> has a chord (6, 3)
- <1, 4, 9, 3, 1> has a chord (4, 3)
- <1, 4, 6, 5, 1> has a chord (4, 5)
- <3, 9, 6, 4, 3> has a chord (9, 4)
- <3, 9, 7, 5, 3> has a chord (9, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are a total of [12] unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 6, 9, 4, 0>; chord (6, 4)
- <0, 6, 9, 3, 0>; chord (6, 3)
- <0, 6, 4, 1, 0>; chord (6, 1)
- <0, 6, 5, 7, 0>; chord (6, 7)
- <9, 6, 4, 1, 9>; chord (6, 1)
- <9, 6, 5, 7, 9>; chord (6, 5)
- <5, 6, 4, 1, 5>; chord (6, 4)
- <5, 6, 9, 3, 5>; chord (6, 3)
- <1, 4, 9, 3, 1>; chord (4, 3)
- <1, 4, 6, 5, 1>; chord (4, 5)
- <3, 9, 6, 4, 3>; chord (9, 4)
- <3, 9, 7, 5, 3>; chord (9, 5)
