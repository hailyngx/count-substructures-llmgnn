Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 7, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 5, 2, 1, 0>
2. <0, 5, 2, 3, 0>
3. <0, 5, 2, 4, 0>
4. <1, 5, 2, 0, 1>
5. <1, 5, 2, 3, 1>
6. <1, 9, 4, 0, 1>
7. <2, 5, 0, 1, 2>
8. <2, 5, 0, 4, 2>
9. <2, 5, 1, 0, 2>
10. <2, 5, 1, 3, 2>
11. <2, 5, 1, 9, 4, 2>
12. <3, 9, 4, 0, 3>
13. <4, 9, 3, 2, 4>
14. <4, 9, 3, 7, 6, 4>
15. <5, 2, 0, 6, 7, 5>
16. <6, 7, 0, 2, 5, 6>
17. <7, 5, 2, 0, 6, 7>
18. <9, 4, 0, 6, 7, 3>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 5, 2, 1, 0> (Chord: 1-2)
2. <0, 5, 2, 3, 0> (Chord: 2-3)
3. <0, 5, 2, 4, 0> (Chord: 2-4)
4. <1, 5, 2, 0, 1> (Chord: 0-2)
5. <1, 9, 4, 0, 1> (Chord: 0-4)
6. <2, 5, 0, 1, 2> (Chord: 0-1)
7. <2, 5, 0, 4, 2> (Chord: 0-4)
8. <2, 5, 1, 0, 2> (Chord: 1-0)
9. <3, 9, 4, 0, 3> (Chord: 0-4)
10. <4, 9, 3, 2, 4> (Chord: 2-3)
11. <5, 2, 0, 6, 7, 5> (Chord: 0-6)
12. <6, 7, 0, 2, 5, 6> (Chord: 0-5)
13. <7, 5, 2, 0, 6, 7> (Chord: 2-6)
14. <9, 4, 0, 6, 7, 3> (Chord: 0-6)

Step 3:
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [14].
