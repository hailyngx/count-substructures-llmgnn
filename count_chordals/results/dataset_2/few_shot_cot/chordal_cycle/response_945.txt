Next, we check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (5, 21), 7>: Cycle 5 has exactly one chord (edge 21, 7)
- <1, 28, (24, 23), 19>: Cycle 7 has exactly one chord (edge 24, 23)
- <2, 27, (14, 6), 20>: Cycle 8 has exactly one chord (edge 14, 6)
- <3, 25, (15, 0), 29>: Cycle 10 has exactly one chord (edge 15, 0)
- <4, (25, 20), 6, 14>: Cycle 14 has exactly one chord (edge 25, 20)
- <6, (20, 17), 22, 26>: Cycle 16 has exactly one chord (edge 20, 17)
- <9, 4, (10, 7), 21>: Cycle 20 has exactly one chord (edge 10, 7)
- <9, (14, 27), 2, 29>: Cycle 21 has exactly one chord (edge 14, 27)
- <16, 25, (15, 0), 29>: Cycle 29 has exactly one chord (edge 15, 0)

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
