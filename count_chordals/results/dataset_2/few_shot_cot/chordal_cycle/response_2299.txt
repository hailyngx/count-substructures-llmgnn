Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 2, 3>
- Cycle 2: <0, 11, 7, 14>
- Cycle 3: <0, 11, 9, 5>
- Cycle 4: <0, 12, 6, 14>
- Cycle 5: <0, 12, 5, 4>
- Cycle 6: <0, 3, 13, 4>
- Cycle 7: <0, 3, 13, 10>
- Cycle 8: <0, 5, 4, 13>
- Cycle 9: <0, 5, 9, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 3, 2, 11>
- Cycle 11: <1, 3, 13, 4>
- Cycle 12: <1, 5, 9, 11>
- Cycle 13: <2, 3, 13, 4>
- Cycle 14: <2, 10, 5, 4>
- Cycle 15: <4, 5, 9, 1>
- Cycle 16: <4, 8, 7, 11>
- Cycle 17: <4, 8, 7, 14>
- Cycle 18: <4, 10, 13, 3>
- Cycle 19: <6, 12, 5, 4>
- Cycle 20: <6, 14, 11, 7>
- Cycle 21: <7, 8, 6, 12>
- Cycle 22: <8, 4, 5, 0>
- Cycle 23: <8, 6, 14, 11>
- Cycle 24: <10, 2, 11, 7>
- Cycle 25: <10, 2, 13, 3>
- Cycle 26: <10, 4, 5, 0>
- Cycle 27: <11, 7, 14, 6>
- Cycle 28: <12, 0, 5, 9>
- Cycle 29: <12, 5, 4, 13>
- Cycle 30: <13, 3, 1, 5>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The chordless cycles found are: 
  - <1, 3, 2, 11>
  - <4, 8, 7, 11>
  - <4, 8, 7, 14>
  - <8, 4, 5, 0>
  - <12, 0, 5, 9>
  - <10, 2, 11, 7>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we get a total of [6].
