Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <1, (5, 17), 12)>.

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle with nodes 1-7-14-10-1 (chord: 7-10)
- Cycle with nodes 1-7-8-16-1 (chord: 7-16)
- Cycle with nodes 1-5-18-2-1 (chord: 5-18)
- Cycle with nodes 1-5-18-4-7-1 (chord: 5-18)
- Cycle with nodes 1-7-15-3-2-18-5-1 (chord: 15-18)
- Cycle with nodes 1-7-15-8-16-10-14-1 (chord: 15-16)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Only the cycle <1, (5, 17), 12)> has exactly one chord (5-17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
