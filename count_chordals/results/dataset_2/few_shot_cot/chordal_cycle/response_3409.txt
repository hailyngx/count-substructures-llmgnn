Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 14, 6, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 9, 11, 13>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 9, 19, 14>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 17, 7, 11>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 14, 19, 9>
- Cycle 6: <1, 15, 16, 11, 7>
- Cycle 7: <1, 10, 18, 13, 2>
- Cycle 8: <3, 14, 19, 9, 4>
- Cycle 9: <4, 12, 2, 13, 11>
- Cycle 10: <5, 17, 11, 13, 8>
- Cycle 11: <6, 10, 18, 13, 11>
- Cycle 12: <7, 17, 5, 0, 3>
- Cycle 13: <9, 19, 14, 3, 0>
- Cycle 14: <11, 16, 15, 1, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 3, 14, 6, 1> has 2 chords: (3, 14) and (6, 1)
- <0, 4, 9, 11, 13> has 1 chord: (4, 11)
- <0, 4, 9, 19, 14> has 1 chord: (9, 14)
- <0, 5, 17, 7, 11> has 1 chord: (5, 7)
- <1, 6, 14, 19, 9> has 1 chord: (6, 19)
- <1, 15, 16, 11, 7> has 1 chord: (15, 11)
- <1, 10, 18, 13, 2> has 1 chord: (10, 13)
- <3, 14, 19, 9, 4> has 1 chord: (4, 19)
- <4, 12, 2, 13, 11> has 1 chord: (12, 13)
- <5, 17, 11, 13, 8> has 1 chord: (17, 13)
- <6, 10, 18, 13, 11> has 1 chord: (10, 13)
- <7, 17, 5, 0, 3> has 1 chord: (0, 5)
- <9, 19, 14, 3, 0> has 1 chord: (3, 14)
- <11, 16, 15, 1, 6> has 1 chord: (15, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found. So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
