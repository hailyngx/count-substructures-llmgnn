Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph (all cycles are chordless):
- <2, 8, 14, 3>
- <3, 4, 14, 8>
- <3, 4, 11, 18>
- <3, 8, 13, 5>
- <5, 1, 12, 2>
- <5, 1, 12, 18>
- <5, 1, 12, 16>
- <5, 13, 8, 2>
- <5, 13, 15, 14>
- <7, 10, 6, 16>
- <10, 6, 16, 12>
- <10, 6, 16, 5>
- <10, 7, 16, 5>
- <11, 4, 14, 3>
- <12, 1, 5, 13>
- <12, 1, 5, 15>
- <12, 1, 5, 16>
- <12, 2, 5, 13>
- <12, 2, 8, 13>
- <15, 5, 13, 8>
- <16, 5, 13, 8>
- <18, 0, 19, 17>

Step 2:
