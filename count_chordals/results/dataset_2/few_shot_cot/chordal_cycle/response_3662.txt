Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 12, 4>
- <0, 5, 12, 14>
- <0, 5, 1, 7>
- <0, 1, 7, 4>
- <0, 1, 7, 9>
- <1, 7, 4, 6>
- <1, 7, 4, 9>
- <1, 7, 9, 14>
- <1, 6, 4, 9>
- <1, 6, 14, 13>
- <1, 11, 13, 12>
- <1, 14, 13, 12>
- <4, 7, 1, 6>
- <4, 7, 9, 14>
- <4, 9, 12, 13>
- <4, 6, 14, 13>
- <5, 1, 6, 4>
- <5, 1, 7, 4>
- <5, 1, 7, 9>
- <6, 1, 11, 13>
- <6, 4, 9, 14>
- <8, 5, 1, 7>
- <8, 5, 12, 13>
- <8, 6, 4, 9>
- <8, 10, 3, 12>
- <9, 7, 4, 6>
- <9, 4, 12, 13>
- <9, 4, 6, 14>
- <9, 4, 7, 1>
- <9, 12, 13, 14>
- <10, 3, 12, 14>
- <11, 1, 7, 4>
- <11, 13, 12, 3>
- <12, 4, 6, 14>
- <12, 5, 1, 7>
- <12, 5, 8, 10>
- <13, 11, 1, 7>
- <13, 12, 14, 9>
- <13, 14, 9, 4>
- <14, 13, 12, 3>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 7, 4, 9> (Chord: 4-9)
- <1, 6, 14, 13> (Chord: 6-13)
- <4, 9, 12, 13> (Chord: 9-12)
- <8, 5, 12, 13> (Chord: 5-12)
- <9, 12, 13, 14> (Chord: 12-13)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 45.
Therefore, the answer is [45].
