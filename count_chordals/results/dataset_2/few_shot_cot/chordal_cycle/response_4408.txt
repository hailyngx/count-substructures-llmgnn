Response:
Let's find the chordal 4-cycles in this graph:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 27, 29, 20>
- Cycle 2: <6, 28, 29, 19>
- Cycle 3: <6, 28, 19, 5>
- Cycle 4: <6, 14, 16, 15>
- Cycle 5: <6, 14, 1, 17>
- Cycle 6: <6, 4, 2, 27>
- Cycle 7: <7, 17, 15, 26>
- Cycle 8: <7, 17, 1, 14>
- Cycle 9: <8, 26, 15, 16>
- Cycle 10: <8, 26, 5, 19>
- Cycle 11: <9, 15, 17, 23>
- Cycle 12: <18, 25, 17, 7>
- Cycle 13: <18, 25, 15, 26>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, 27, 29, 20> - Chord: (27, 29)
- Cycle 4: <6, 14, 16, 15> - Chord: (14, 16)
- Cycle 6: <6, 4, 2, 27> - Chord: (4, 27)
- Cycle 7: <7, 17, 15, 26> - Chord: (17, 15)
- Cycle 8: <7, 17, 1, 14> - Chord: (17, 1)
- Cycle 9: <8, 26, 15, 16> - Chord: (26, 15)
- Cycle 11: <9, 15, 17, 23> - Chord: (15, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final answer is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, 27, 29, 20>
- <6, 14, 16, 15>
- <6, 4, 2, 27>
- <7, 17, 15, 26>
- <7, 17, 1, 14>
- <9, 15, 17, 23>
