Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 7, 1, 8, 10, 2, 9, 5> with edges (0, 7), (7, 1), (1, 8), (8, 10), (10, 2), (2, 9), (9, 5), (5, 13), (13, 11), (11, 6), (6, 0)
- Cycle <0, 7, 3, 12, 2, 9, 5> with edges (0, 7), (7, 3), (3, 12), (12, 2), (2, 9), (9, 5), (5, 13), (13, 11), (11, 6), (6, 0)
- Cycle <0, 7, 3, 12, 4, 14, 11, 6> with edges (0, 7), (7, 3), (3, 12), (12, 4), (4, 14), (14, 11), (11, 6), (6, 0)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 7, 1, 8, 10, 2, 9, 5> has a chord (2, 10)
- <0, 7, 3, 12, 2, 9, 5> has a chord (3, 12)
- <0, 7, 3, 12, 4, 14, 11, 6> has a chord (4, 14)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0].
