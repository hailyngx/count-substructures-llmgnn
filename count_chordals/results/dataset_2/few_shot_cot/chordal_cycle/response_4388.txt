Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 1, 0>
2. Cycle <5, 9, 1, 10>
3. Cycle <5, 9, 4, 13>
4. Cycle <5, 9, 13, 7>
5. Cycle <5, 11, 10, 2>
6. Cycle <5, 11, 7, 12>
7. Cycle <5, 11, 14, 8>
8. Cycle <9, 1, 3, 13>
9. Cycle <9, 1, 8, 14>
10. Cycle <9, 4, 12, 8>
11. Cycle <9, 4, 13, 7>
12. Cycle <10, 3, 13, 12>
13. Cycle <10, 11, 7, 14>
14. Cycle <1, 0, 6, 5>
15. Cycle <1, 10, 2, 12>
16. Cycle <1, 10, 11, 7>
17. Cycle <1, 3, 13, 12>
18. Cycle <3, 10, 11, 7>
19. Cycle <3, 13, 12, 4>
20. Cycle <4, 12, 2, 10>
21. Cycle <7, 5, 14, 8>
22. Cycle <7, 11, 0, 6>
23. Cycle <7, 11, 14, 8>
24. Cycle <7, 12, 2, 10>
25. Cycle <8, 14, 5, 9>
26. Cycle <8, 14, 7, 12>
27. Cycle <12, 4, 13, 7>
28. Cycle <13, 9, 5, 14>

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <5, 9, 1, 10> with chord (1, 10)
2. <5, 11, 10, 2> with chord (10, 2)
3. <5, 11, 14, 8> with chord (14, 8)
4. <9, 1, 3, 13> with chord (1, 3)
5. <10, 3, 13, 12> with chord (3, 13)
6. <1, 3, 13, 12> with chord (3, 13)
7. <8, 14, 7, 12> with chord (14, 7)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles is [7].
