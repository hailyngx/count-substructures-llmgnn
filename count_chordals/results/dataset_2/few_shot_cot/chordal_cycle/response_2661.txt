Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <0, 5, 3, 2, 7>
2. <0, 5, 3, 2, 4>
3. <0, 5, 3, 9, 6>
4. <0, 7, 4, 6, 9>
5. <0, 7, 4, 2, 3>
6. <0, 8, 7, 4, 2>
7. <0, 8, 5, 6, 9>
8. <1, 3, 2, 4, 7>
9. <1, 3, 2, 7, 8>
10. <1, 3, 5, 6, 9>
11. <1, 6, 4, 7, 8>
12. <1, 9, 6, 4, 7>
13. <2, 4, 6, 5, 3>
14. <2, 7, 4, 6, 9>
15. <3, 9, 6, 4, 7>
16. <5, 6, 4, 7, 2>
17. <5, 6, 9, 3, 2>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. Chord <5, 3> in <0, 5, 3, 2, 7>
2. Chord <5, 3> in <0, 5, 3, 2, 4>
3. Chord <5, 3> in <0, 5, 3, 9, 6>
4. Chord <7, 4> in <0, 7, 4, 6, 9>
5. Chord <7, 4> in <0, 7, 4, 2, 3>
6. Chord <8, 7> in <0, 8, 7, 4, 2>
7. Chord <8, 5> in <0, 8, 5, 6, 9>
8. Chord <4, 7> in <1, 3, 2, 4, 7>
9. Chord <7, 8> in <1, 3, 2, 7, 8>
10. Chord <6, 9> in <1, 3, 5, 6, 9>
11. Chord <7, 8> in <1, 6, 4, 7, 8>
12. Chord <7, 4> in <1, 9, 6, 4, 7>
13. Chord <6, 5> in <2, 4, 6, 5, 3>
14. Chord <7, 9> in <2, 7, 4, 6, 9>
15. Chord <7, 4> in <3, 9, 6, 4, 7>
16. Chord <7, 2> in <5, 6, 4, 7, 2>
17. Chord <6, 3> in <5, 6, 9, 3, 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0] because all cycles of length 4 or more have at least one chord.
