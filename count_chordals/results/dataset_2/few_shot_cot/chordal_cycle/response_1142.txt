Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <1, (10, 2), 5)>.
Following the steps outlined:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
      - Cycle 1: 1-4-7-5-2-1
      - Cycle 2: 1-4-7-13-11-1
      - Cycle 3: 1-3-2-5-1
      - Cycle 4: 1-3-2-13-11-1
      
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
      - Checking Cycle 1: 1-4-7-5-2-1 has a chord (10, 2) connecting non-adjacent nodes 1 and 2.
      - Checking Cycle 2: 1-4-7-13-11-1 has no chords.
      - Checking Cycle 3: 1-3-2-5-1 has no chords.
      - Checking Cycle 4: 1-3-2-13-11-1 has no chords.
      
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
      - Only Cycle 1 has exactly one chord, so the count is [1].
