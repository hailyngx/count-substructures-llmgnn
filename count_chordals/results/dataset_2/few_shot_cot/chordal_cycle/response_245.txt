Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 13, 22, 27, 14, 2, 18, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 13, 22, 27, 12, 29, 9, 11>
- Cycle 3: <0, 13, 22, 8, 11, 28, 19, 2>
- Cycle 4: <0, 15, 13, 22, 27, 12, 29, 7>
- Cycle 5: <0, 15, 18, 4, 16, 17, 21, 13>
- Cycle 6: <0, 15, 25, 5, 2, 14, 27, 22>
- Cycle 7: <0, 10, 16, 17, 21, 4, 18, 15>
- Cycle 8: <2, 14, 27, 22, 13, 15, 0, 3>
- Cycle 9: <2, 14, 27, 12, 29, 9, 11, 8>
- Cycle 10: <2, 18, 15, 13, 22, 27, 12, 29>
- Cycle 11: <2, 5, 4, 16, 17, 14, 27, 22>
- Cycle 12: <2, 7, 29, 12, 27, 22, 13, 0>
- Cycle 13: <5, 25, 15, 13, 22, 27, 12, 29>
- Cycle 14: <9, 11, 28, 19, 2, 5, 25, 15>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, 13, 22, 27, 14, 2, 18, 4> - This cycle has a chord: (13, 2).
- Cycle 2: <0, 13, 22, 27, 12, 29, 9, 11> - This cycle has a chord: (22, 9).
- Cycle 3: <0, 13, 22, 8, 11, 28, 19, 2> - This cycle has a chord: (13, 19).
- Cycle 4: <0, 13, 22, 27, 14, 2, 18, 4> - This cycle has a chord: (13, 2).
- Cycle 5: <0, 15, 13, 22, 27, 12, 29, 7> - This cycle has a chord: (15, 29).
- Cycle 6: <0, 15, 18, 4, 16, 17, 21, 13> - This cycle has a chord: (4, 17).
- Cycle 7: <0, 15, 25, 5, 2, 14, 27, 22> - This cycle has a chord: (15, 27).
- Cycle 8: <0, 10, 16, 17, 21, 4, 18, 15> - This cycle has a chord: (16, 21).
- Cycle 9: <2, 14, 27, 22, 13, 15, 0, 3> - This cycle has a chord: (14, 22).
- Cycle 10: <2, 14, 27, 12, 29, 9, 11, 8> - This cycle has a chord: (27, 11).
- Cycle 11: <2, 18, 15, 13, 22, 27, 12, 29> - This cycle has a chord: (15, 27).
- Cycle 12: <2, 5, 4, 16, 17, 14, 27, 22> - This cycle has a chord: (5, 16).
- Cycle 13: <2, 7, 29, 12, 27, 22, 13, 0> - This cycle has a chord: (29, 13).
- Cycle 14: <5, 25, 15, 13, 22, 27, 12, 29> - This cycle has a chord: (25, 15).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 14 cycles found, and 13 of them have exactly one chord. Hence, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [13].
