Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 5, 6, 0>
2. <0, 1, 9, 6, 0>
3. <0, 1, 4, 7, 0>
4. <1, 4, 7, 9, 1>
5. <1, 9, 6, 2, 1>
6. <1, 5, 6, 2, 1>
7. <2, 4, 7, 9, 2>
8. <2, 4, 6, 3, 2>
9. <2, 6, 8, 5, 2>
10. <2, 6, 9, 1, 2>
11. <3, 4, 7, 0, 3>
12. <3, 4, 6, 9, 3>
13. <4, 7, 9, 6, 4>
14. <5, 6, 9, 1, 5>
15. <5, 8, 0, 1, 5>
16. <6, 9, 7, 4, 6>
17. <6, 9, 2, 1, 6>
18. <6, 9, 7, 0, 6>
19. <7, 9, 6, 4, 7>
20. <8, 6, 5, 1, 8>
21. <8, 6, 9, 2, 8>
22. <0, 7, 4, 1, 0>
23. <0, 7, 9, 6, 0>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <2, 6, 9, 1> (Chord: (2, 9))
2. <5, 6, 9, 1> (Chord: (6, 9))
3. <6, 9, 7, 4> (Chord: (9, 7))

Step 3:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
