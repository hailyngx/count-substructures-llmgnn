Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 3, 10, 6>
- <0, 6, 16, 14>
- <0, 6, 18, 4>
- <0, 19, 15, 4>
- <0, 19, 13, 9>
- <1, 12, 14, 7>
- <1, 17, 11, 7>
- <1, 17, 7, 14>
- <3, 10, 15, 4>
- <4, 14, 7, 1>
- <4, 14, 12, 1>
- <4, 14, 18, 6>
- <5, 9, 16, 14>
- <5, 9, 13, 8>
- <5, 8, 13, 9>
- <6, 10, 3, 0>
- <6, 10, 15, 4>
- <6, 16, 9, 5>
- <7, 1, 12, 14>
- <7, 1, 17, 11>
- <7, 14, 18, 6>
- <8, 13, 19, 9>
- <8, 13, 9, 5>
- <9, 13, 19, 15>
- <12, 14, 18, 6>

Step 2: Categorizing the cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycles: <0, 3, 10, 6, (0, 6)>
- Chordal cycles: <1, 12, 14, 7, (1, 14)>
- Chordal cycles: <4, 14, 18, 6, (14, 6)>
- Chordal cycles: <5, 9, 16, 14, (9, 14)>
- Chordal cycles: <8, 13, 19, 9, (13, 9)>
- Chordal cycles: <7, 1, 12, 14, (1, 12)>
- Chordal cycles: <6, 10, 3, 0, (6, 10)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 22 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Final Answer: [22]
