Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2: 
- No chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Step 3:
- Therefore, the total number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
