Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <4, 5, 9, 7, 4>
- Cycle 2: <3, 4, 8, 7, 3>
- Cycle 3: <1, 6, 2, 9, 1>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 8, 2, 0>
- Cycle 5: <2, 6, 1, 8, 2>
- Cycle 6: <5, 9, 2, 6, 5>
- Cycle 7: <4, 8, 1, 6, 4>
- Cycle 8: <7, 9, 3, 0, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (3, 8)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (5, 2)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (8, 1)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (9, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are a total of [0] chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
