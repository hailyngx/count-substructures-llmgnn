Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7)

Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
Step 1:  
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 4)  
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 6, 3)  
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 8, 4)  
- Cycle 4: (5, 6, 3, 7)  
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 8, 9)  
- Cycle 6: (5, 4, 1, 9)  
- Cycle 7: (9, 6, 3, 1)  
- Cycle 8: (9, 6, 8, 4)  
- Cycle 9: (9, 8, 4, 5)  
- Cycle 10: (6, 3, 7, 1)  
- Cycle 11: (1, 3, 7, 0)  
- Cycle 12: (1, 3, 2, 8)  
- Cycle 13: (1, 2, 8, 9)  
- Cycle 14: (3, 7, 0, 5)  
- Cycle 15: (4, 1, 9, 5)  
- Cycle 16: (4, 1, 7, 3)  
- Cycle 17: (4, 8, 2, 1)  
- Cycle 18: (7, 3, 1, 9)  
- Cycle 19: (7, 3, 5, 9)  
- Cycle 20: (8, 2, 1, 9)

Step 2:  
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle...  
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <5, (9, 1), 4>  
- <5, (9, 6), 3>  
- <5, (9, 8), 4>  
- <5, (6, 3), 7>  
- <5, (6, 8), 9>  
- <5, (4, 1), 9>  
- <9, (6, 3), 1>  
- <9, (6, 8), 4>  
- <9, (8, 4), 5>  
- <6, (3, 7), 1>  
- <1, (3, 7), 0>  
- <1, (3, 2), 8>  
- <1, (2, 8), 9>  
- <3, (7, 0), 5>  
- <4, (1, 9), 5>  
- <4, (1, 7), 3>  
- <4, (8, 2), 1>  
- <7, (3, 1), 9>  
- <7, (3, 5), 9>  
- <8, (2, 1), 9>  

Step 3:  
Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles, we have found 20 chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the final count is [20].
