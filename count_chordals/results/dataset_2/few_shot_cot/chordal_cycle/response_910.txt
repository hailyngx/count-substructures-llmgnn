Response:
Step 1:  
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the given graph. We can list them as follows: 
- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 2: (5, 4, 19, 16)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 15, 8)
- Cycle 4: (5, 17, 11, 8)
- Cycle 5: (6, 11, 8, 15)
- Cycle 6: (16, 0, 1, 15)
- Cycle 7: (16, 0, 12, 17)
- Cycle 8: (16, 19, 10, 13)
- Cycle 9: (4, 15, 1, 10)
- Cycle 10: (5, 14, 15, 8)
- Cycle 11: (11, 8, 15, 1)
- Cycle 12: (12, 17, 11, 6)
- Cycle 13: (17, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 14: (17, 12, 16, 0)
- Cycle 15: (18, 14, 5, 4)
- Cycle 16: (18, 13, 10, 19)
- Cycle 17: (18, 3, 7, 6)
- Cycle 18: (18, 13, 9, 3)
- Cycle 19: (19, 4, 5, 14)

Step 2:  
We can now check each cycle for the presence of exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has the chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 2 has the chord (4, 16)
- Cycle 3 has the chord (4, 15)
- Cycle 4 has the chord (5, 11)
- Cycle 5 has the chord (11, 8)
- Cycle 6 has the chord (0, 15)
- Cycle 7 has the chord (0, 17)
- Cycle 8 has the chord (16, 13)
- Cycle 9 has the chord (15, 10)
- Cycle 10 has the chord (14, 15)
- Cycle 11 has the chord (8, 1)
- Cycle 12 has the chord (12, 11)
- Cycle 13 has the chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 14 has the chord (12, 16)
- Cycle 15 has the chord (5, 4)
- Cycle 16 has the chord (13, 19)
- Cycle 17 has the chord (7, 6)
- Cycle 18 has the chord (13, 9)
- Cycle 19 has the chord (4, 5)

Step 3:  
The chordless cycles found are:
- <4, 5, 2, 6>
- <16, 0, 1, 15>
- <16, 19, 10, 13>
- <18, 14, 5, 4>

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
