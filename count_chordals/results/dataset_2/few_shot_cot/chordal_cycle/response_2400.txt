Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, 0, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 8, 9, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 3, 6, 0, 2>
- Cycle 4: <2, 4, 9, 8, 5, 7, 3, 2>
- Cycle 5: <4, 9, 0, 6, 5, 4>
- Cycle 6: <5, 4, 2, 3, 7, 0, 6, 5>
- Cycle 7: <7, 1, 4, 5, 7>
- Cycle 8: <8, 9, 0, 5, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Only Cycle 4: <2, 4, 9, 8, 5, 7, 3, 2> has exactly one chord: (4, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
