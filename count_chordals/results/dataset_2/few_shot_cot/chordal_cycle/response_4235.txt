Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
1. <0, 9, 8, 1, 5>
2. <0, 9, 2, 7, 5>
3. <1, 5, 4, 6, 0>
4. <1, 5, 9, 2, 7>
5. <2, 9, 8, 1, 5>
6. <2, 9, 4, 6, 0>
7. <3, 4, 5, 7, 2>
8. <3, 4, 6, 0, 7>
9. <3, 1, 5, 7, 2>
10. <4, 5, 9, 2, 7>
11. <4, 5, 7, 0, 6>
12. <4, 5, 1, 8, 9>
13. <5, 7, 0, 6, 4>
14. <5, 1, 8, 9, 2>
15. <6, 0, 7, 5, 9>
16. <6, 0, 9, 8, 4>
17. <7, 5, 1, 8, 9>
18. <8, 9, 2, 7, 5>
19. <8, 9, 4, 6, 0>
20. <8, 1, 5, 7, 2>
21. <9, 5, 1, 8, 4>
22. <9, 5, 7, 0, 6>
23. <9, 8, 1, 5, 7>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <4, 5, 1, 8> with chord (5, 8).
  
Step 3:
Hence, the number of chordless cycles found is [22].
