Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- 4-cycle: <1, 13, 19, 5>
- 4-cycle: <2, 11, 4, 15>
- 4-cycle: <2, 11, 0, 4>
- 4-cycle: <2, 11, 4, 1>
- 4-cycle: <2, 11, 0, 11>
- 4-cycle: <2, 11, 0, 2>
- 4-cycle: <2, 15, 18, 14>
- 4-cycle: <2, 15, 18, 15>
- 4-cycle: <2, 15, 12, 6>
- 4-cycle: <2, 15, 16, 6>
- 4-cycle: <2, 15, 16, 10>
- 4-cycle: <2, 15, 16, 8>
- 4-cycle: <2, 15, 16, 7>
- 4-cycle: <2, 15, 4, 11>
- 4-cycle: <2, 15, 4, 13>
- 4-cycle: ...

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <2, 11, 4, 15> has one chord (2, 15)
- <2, 11, 0, 4> has one chord (0, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are many chordless cycles, including:
- <1, 13, 19, 5>
- <2, 11, 0, 11>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
