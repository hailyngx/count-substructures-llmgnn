Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 1, 11, 2, 0> (Chord: (1, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 1, 11, 5, 0> (Chord: (1, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 1, 11, 12, 5, 0> (Chord: (1, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 10, 2, 11, 1, 0> (Chord: (1, 11))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 28 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
