Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph, but we will only consider cycles of length 4 for this problem. 

Cycles of length 4:
1. <11, 16, 4, 1>
2. <11, 16, 10, 15>
3. <11, 2, 5, 1>
4. <11, 2, 9, 8>
5. <16, 10, 15, 5>
6. <16, 4, 8, 9>
7. <4, 1, 5, 2>
8. <8, 9, 2, 11>
9. <8, 6, 14, 0>
10. <8, 12, 15, 10>
11. <8, 18, 19, 18>
12. <0, 7, 14, 6>
13. <14, 6, 8, 4>
14. <14, 7, 0, 14>
15. <7, 0, 14, 6>
16. <10, 18, 19, 18>
17. <15, 12, 3, 2>
18. <15, 17, 6, 8>
19. <9, 2, 5, 1>
20. <18, 19, 18, 8>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <11, 16, 4, 1> has a chord (1, 16)
- <11, 2, 9, 8> has a chord (8, 11)
- <16, 4, 8, 9> has a chord (8, 4)
- <8, 12, 15, 10> has a chord (12, 15)
- <14, 7, 0, 14> has a chord (0, 7)
- <15, 12, 3, 2> has a chord (12, 3)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [14]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<11, 16, 10, 15>
<11, 2, 5, 1>
<4, 1, 5, 2>
<8, 9, 2, 11>
<8, 6, 14, 0>
<8, 18, 19, 18>
<0, 7, 14, 6>
<14, 6, 8, 4>
<7, 0, 14, 6>
<15, 17, 6, 8>
<9, 2, 5, 1>
<18, 19, 18, 8>
