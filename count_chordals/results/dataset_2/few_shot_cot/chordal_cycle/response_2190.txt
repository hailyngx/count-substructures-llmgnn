Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 23, 7, 13, 4, 21, 2, 27, 15, 1, 16>
- Cycle 2: <0, 23, 7, 2, 27, 15, 1, 25, 10>
- Cycle 3: <0, 23, 7, 13, 19, 20, 17, 26, 24, 11, 5>
- Cycle 4: <0, 23, 7, 2, 27, 15, 14, 29, 26>
- Cycle 5: <0, 23, 7, 13, 19, 20, 17, 26, 24, 29, 3>
- Cycle 6: <0, 23, 7, 13, 4, 8, 25, 10>
- Cycle 7: <0, 23, 7, 2, 27, 15, 14, 0, 29>
- Cycle 8: <0, 23, 7, 13, 19, 20, 17, 26, 29, 24, 11>
- Cycle 9: <0, 23, 7, 2, 27, 28, 22, 3, 29>
- Cycle 10: <0, 12, 11, 24, 26, 29, 3, 22, 28, 19>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- There are no cycles with exactly one chord in this graph.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 10 chordless cycles found.

Final answer: [10]
