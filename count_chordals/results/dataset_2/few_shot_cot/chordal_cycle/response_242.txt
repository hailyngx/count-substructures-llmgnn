Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle: <0, 1, 7, 6>
2. Cycle: <0, 1, 5, 6>
3. Cycle: <0, 1, 7, 4>
4. Cycle: <0, 1, 8, 9>
5. Cycle: <0, 6, 7, 4>
6. Cycle: <0, 6, 7, 3>
7. Cycle: <0, 8, 4, 3>
8. Cycle: <1, 7, 4, 8>
9. Cycle: <1, 7, 4, 3>
10. Cycle: <1, 7, 3, 8>
11. Cycle: <2, 4, 7, 3>
12. Cycle: <2, 4, 8, 9>
13. Cycle: <2, 7, 4, 8>
14. Cycle: <2, 7, 4, 3>
15. Cycle: <3, 7, 4, 8>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 1, 7, 6> has exactly one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle <0, 1, 5, 6> has exactly one chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle <0, 1, 7, 4> has exactly one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle <0, 1, 8, 9> has exactly one chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle <0, 6, 7, 4> has exactly one chord: (6, 4)
- Cycle <0, 6, 7, 3> has exactly one chord: (6, 3)
- Cycle <0, 8, 4, 3> has exactly one chord: (8, 4)
- Cycle <1, 7, 4, 8> has exactly one chord: (7, 4)
- Cycle <1, 7, 4, 3> has exactly one chord: (7, 4)
- Cycle <1, 7, 3, 8> has exactly one chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle <2, 4, 7, 3> has exactly one chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle <2, 4, 8, 9> has exactly one chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle <2, 7, 4, 8> has exactly one chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle <2, 7, 4, 3> has exactly one chord: (7, 4)
- Cycle <3, 7, 4, 8> has exactly one chord: (7, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 5 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
