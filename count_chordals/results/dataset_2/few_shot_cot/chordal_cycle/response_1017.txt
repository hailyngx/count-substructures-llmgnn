- <14, 8, 1, 5, 0>
- <14, 8, 2, 11, 4>
- <14, 10, 4, 9, 0>

Step 2: Check for only one chord in each cycle:
- <2, (8, 14), 10, 4, 9>
- <6, (12, 14), 8, 2, 11>
- <8, (1, 5), 0, 3, 12>
- <0, (3, 5), 12, 6, 13>
- <4, (9, 11), 2, 8, 10>
- <4, (9, 11), 9, 0, 5>
- <4, (9, 13), 6, 12, 5>
- <6, (12, 13), 4, 9, 11>
- <10, (7, 6), 12, 3, 0>
- <12, (3, 5), 0, 9, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
