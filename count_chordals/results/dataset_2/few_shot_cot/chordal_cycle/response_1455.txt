Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:  
1. <0, 4, 1, 9>
2. <0, 4, 1, 6>
3. <0, 4, 6, 7>
4. <0, 4, 6, 3>
5. <0, 4, 8, 9>
6. <0, 8, 9, 5>
7. <1, 4, 6, 7>
8. <1, 4, 6, 3>
9. <1, 4, 8, 9>
10. <1, 9, 5, 2>
11. <2, 5, 9, 8>
12. <2, 5, 9, 1>
13. <2, 9, 8, 4>
14. <2, 9, 8, 0>
15. <3, 5, 9, 8>
16. <3, 5, 2, 1>
17. <3, 8, 0, 4>
18. <3, 8, 0, 6>

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord are: 
1. <0, 4, 1, 9> (Chord: 4)
2. <0, 4, 1, 6> (Chord: 1)
3. <0, 4, 6, 7> (Chord: 6)
4. <0, 4, 6, 3> (Chord: 4)
5. <0, 4, 8, 9> (Chord: 9)
6. <1, 4, 6, 7> (Chord: 4)
7. <1, 4, 6, 3> (Chord: 1)
8. <1, 4, 8, 9> (Chord: 8)
9. <2, 5, 9, 1> (Chord: 5)
10. <2, 9, 8, 0> (Chord: 9)
11. <3, 5, 9, 8> (Chord: 5)

Step 3: 
There are 11 chordless 4-cycles in the graph. Therefore, the final count is [11].
