Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 3, 4> (with all edges existing)
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 8, 5> (with all edges existing)
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 3, 5> (with all edges existing)
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 13, 5> (with all edges existing)
- Cycle 5: <1, 3, 5, 8> (with all edges existing)
- Cycle 6: <1, 8, 13, 4> (with all edges existing)
- Cycle 7: <3, 5, 7, 4> (with all edges existing)
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 13, 4> (with all edges existing)
- Cycle 9: <3, 5, 8, 1> (with all edges existing)
- Cycle 10: <4, 7, 5, 13> (with all edges existing)
- Cycle 11: <4, 7, 11, 10> (with all edges existing)
- Cycle 12: <4, 13, 9, 3> (with all edges existing)
- Cycle 13: <5, 7, 2, 13> (with all edges existing)
- Cycle 14: <6, 4, 13, 9> (with all edges existing)
- Cycle 15: <9, 10, 6, 4> (with all edges existing)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Only Cycle 5: <1, 3, 5, 8> has exactly one chord <3, 5>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- The number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [14].
