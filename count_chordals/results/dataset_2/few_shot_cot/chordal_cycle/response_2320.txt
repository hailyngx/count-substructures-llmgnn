Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
1. <0, 5, 7, 8, 0> (Cycle of length 4)
2. <0, 5, 1, 4, 8, 0> (Cycle of length 5)
3. <1, 7, 5, 2, 1> (Cycle of length 4)
4. <4, 9, 8, 4> (Cycle of length 3)
5. <5, 1, 4, 9, 5> (Cycle of length 4)
6. <5, 7, 3, 4, 9, 5> (Cycle of length 5)
7. <5, 7, 3, 2, 5> (Cycle of length 4)
8. <8, 9, 5, 7, 8> (Cycle of length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
1. <0, 5, 1, 4, 8, 0> has a chord 1-4
2. <5, 7, 3, 4, 9, 5> has a chord 4-5

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are [6] chordless cycles in the graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, 4, 8, 5> (Chord: (4, 1))
