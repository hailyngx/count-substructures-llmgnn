Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <1, 4, 11, 5>
2. <1, 4, 7, 2>
3. <1, 2, 8, 5>
4. <1, 9, 12, 3>
5. <2, 7, 4, 1>
6. <2, 7, 8, 5>
7. <2, 0, 10, 5>
8. <2, 12, 9, 1>
9. <3, 5, 11, 4>
10. <3, 5, 13, 12>
11. <3, 6, 14, 7>
12. <4, 11, 10, 0>
13. <4, 7, 14, 6>
14. <5, 11, 10, 0>
15. <5, 8, 7, 4>
16. <5, 8, 13, 12>
17. <5, 13, 12, 9>
18. <6, 14, 7, 4>
19. <7, 14, 6, 3>
20. <8, 13, 12, 9>
21. <10, 11, 5, 3>
22. <14, 7, 4, 11>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<2, 7, (4, 11), 1>

Step 3:
The final count of chordless 4-cycles is [21].
