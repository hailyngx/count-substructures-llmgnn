Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 9>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 1, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 1, 3>
- Cycle 5: <0, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 6: <0, 7, 8, 9>
- Cycle 7: <0, 7, 8, 6>
- Cycle 8: <0, 3, 1, 5>
- Cycle 9: <0, 3, 8, 9>
- Cycle 10: <0, 3, 6, 5>
- Cycle 11: <1, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle 12: <1, 5, 2, 1>
- Cycle 13: <1, 5, 0, 3>
- Cycle 14: <1, 9, 3, 0>
- Cycle 15: <1, 9, 8, 7>
- Cycle 16: <1, 3, 6, 5>
- Cycle 17: <1, 3, 8, 9>
- Cycle 18: <3, 9, 1, 5>
- Cycle 19: <3, 9, 8, 7>
- Cycle 20: <3, 9, 9, 1>
- Cycle 21: <3, 9, 1, 0>
- Cycle 22: <3, 1, 5, 4>
- Cycle 23: <3, 1, 2, 5>
- Cycle 24: <3, 1, 0, 5>
- Cycle 25: <3, 1, 5, 6>
- Cycle 26: <3, 6, 8, 7>
- Cycle 27: <6, 5, 2, 1>
- Cycle 28: <6, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle 29: <6, 7, 8, 9>
- Cycle 30: <6, 7, 0, 5>
- Cycle 31: <6, 7, 8, 3>
- Cycle 32: <6, 8, 9, 8>
- Cycle 33: <6, 8, 9, 7>
- Cycle 34: <6, 8, 0, 5>
- Cycle 35: <8, 9, 1, 5>
- Cycle 36: <8, 9, 8, 7>
- Cycle 37: <8, 9, 9, 1>
- Cycle 38: <8, 9, 1, 0>
- Cycle 39: <8, 7, 0, 5>
- Cycle 40: <8, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 41: <8, 7, 0, 3>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 9> (0, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 5, 1, 3> (0, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 7, 6, 5> (0, 3)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 9, 8, 7> (1, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6, 7, 8, 9> (2, 5)

Step 3:
We found a total of 5 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the count is [5].
