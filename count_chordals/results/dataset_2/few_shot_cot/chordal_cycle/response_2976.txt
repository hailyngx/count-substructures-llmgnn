Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <0, 4, 5, 24> with non-adjacent chord (0, 5).

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 5, 24, 28, 1, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 5, 24, 28, 1, 19, 11>
- Cycle 3: <4, 5, 24, 28, 1, 8, 0, 12>
- Cycle 4: <4, 5, 24, 28, 1, 19, 11, 17>
- Cycle 5: <5, 24, 28, 1, 8, 0, 12, 22>
- Cycle 6: <5, 24, 28, 1, 19, 11, 17, 3>
- Cycle 7: <24, 28, 1, 8, 0, 12, 22, 26>
- Cycle 8: <24, 28, 1, 19, 11, 17, 3, 15>
- Cycle 9: <28, 1, 8, 0, 12, 22, 26, 14>
