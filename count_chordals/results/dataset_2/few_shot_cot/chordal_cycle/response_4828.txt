Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, but let's list the cycles for further analysis:
1. Cycle 1: <0, 16, 17, 5, 7> 
2. Cycle 2: <0, 14, 16, 17, 5>
3. Cycle 3: <0, 16, 17, 3, 18>
4. Cycle 4: <1, 2, 13, 17, 5>
5. Cycle 5: <1, 2, 13, 17, 9>
6. Cycle 6: <1, 11, 4, 10, 7>
7. Cycle 7: <2, 13, 12, 15, 6>
8. Cycle 8: <3, 17, 13, 12, 18>
9. Cycle 9: <4, 10, 7, 6, 15>
10. Cycle 10: <5, 17, 9, 11, 4>
11. Cycle 11: <6, 7, 5, 17, 9>
12. Cycle 12: <6, 15, 9, 18, 12>
13. Cycle 13: <7, 10, 4, 11, 9>
14. Cycle 14: <8, 6, 7, 10, 19>
15. Cycle 15: <8, 11, 9, 18, 12>
16. Cycle 16: <8, 11, 4, 10, 7>
17. Cycle 17: <8, 12, 13, 17, 16>
18. Cycle 18: <9, 15, 6, 7, 5>
19. Cycle 19: <9, 15, 12, 13, 17>
20. Cycle 20: <10, 19, 8, 11, 4>
21. Cycle 21: <12, 13, 17, 5, 7>
22. Cycle 22: <12, 18, 3, 17, 5>
23. Cycle 23: <15, 6, 7, 5, 17>
24. Cycle 24: <15, 9, 11, 4, 10>

Step 2:
After checking each cycle, we find the following chordal 4-cycles:
1. Chordal cycle 1: <0, (14, 16), 17, 5>
2. Chordal cycle 2: <1, (2, 13), 17, 5>
3. Chordal cycle 3: <1, (2, 13), 17, 9>
4. Chordal cycle 4: <1, 11, 4, (10, 7)>
5. Chordal cycle 5: <2, (13, 12), 15, 6>
6. Chordal cycle 6: <3, 17, (13, 12), 18>
7. Chordal cycle 7: <4, 10, 7, 6>
8. Chordal cycle 8: <5, 17, 9, 11>
9. Chordal cycle 9: <6, 7, 5, 17>
10. Chordal cycle 10: <8, 11, 4, 10>
11. Chordal cycle 11: <12, 13, 17, 5>
12. Chordal cycle 12: <15, 9, 11, 4>

Step 3:
After counting the chordless cycles found, we have a total of [12] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
