Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 7, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, 1, 9, 8>. 

Let's go through the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle: 0-1-9-8-0 
  This cycle has a chord 1-9.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle 0-1-9-8-0 has the chord 1-9.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Since we found one unique chordal 4-cycle, the final count is [1].
