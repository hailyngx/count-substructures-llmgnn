Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
1. <0, 28, 24, 21, 4, 19, 0>
2. <0, 28, 24, 26, 27, 22, 4, 21, 24, 28, 0>
3. <1, 5, 23, 3, 14, 29, 15, 12, 8, 10, 11, 19, 4, 22, 27, 16, 20, 18, 14, 3, 3, 13, 8, 7, 9, 15, 6, 5, 1>
4. <2, 22, 17, 8, 13, 3, 14, 29, 15, 12, 25, 20, 16, 27, 9, 7, 8, 12, 2>
5. <6, 15, 12, 25, 20, 16, 9, 7, 8, 10, 11, 18, 20, 3, 13, 8, 17, 22, 27, 26, 24, 21, 4, 19, 0, 28, 24, 26, 27, 9, 15, 29, 14, 3, 23, 5, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- In the cycle <0, 28, 24, 26, 27, 22, 4, 21, 24, 28, 0>, the chord (26, 27) exists.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [6]
