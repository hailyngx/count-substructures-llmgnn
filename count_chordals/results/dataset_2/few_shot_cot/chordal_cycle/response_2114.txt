Node 5 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 3, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 2, 8, 7, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 2, 5, 3, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 5, 3, 7, 0>
- Cycle 6: <2, 8, 7, 3, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 6, 9, 0, 3>
- Cycle 8: <3, 6, 4, 0, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 9, 0, 7, 3>
- Cycle 10: <4, 6, 9, 3, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 2, 5, 0, 4>
- Cycle 12: <5, 2, 8, 7, 5>
- Cycle 13: <6, 9, 3, 4, 6>
- Cycle 14: <7, 8, 2, 0, 7>
- Cycle 15: <8, 6, 4, 0, 8>
- Cycle 16: <9, 6, 4, 0, 9>

Step 2: 
Out of the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 3> (Chord: (0, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 9, 3, 7> (Chord: (9, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 2, 8, 7> (Chord: (0, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 2, 5, 3> (Chord: (2, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 8, 7, 3> (Chord: (8, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <3, 6, 9, 0> (Chord: (3, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, 6, 4, 0> (Chord: (6, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <3, 9, 0, 7> (Chord: (9, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, 6, 9, 3> (Chord: (6, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <4, 2, 5, 0> (Chord: (2, 5))
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <5, 2, 8, 7> (Chord: (2, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <6, 9, 3, 4> (Chord: (9, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <7, 8, 2, 0> (Chord: (8, 2))
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <8, 6, 4, 0> (Chord: (6, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <9, 6, 4, 0> (Chord: (6, 4))

Step 3:
There are 15 chordless cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [15].
