Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <0, 1, 9, 11>
2. <0, 1, 17, 4>
3. <0, 1, 9, 13>
4. <0, 1, 17, 4>
5. <0, 4, 14, 8>
6. <0, 4, 17, 1>
7. <0, 4, 19, 7>
8. <0, 4, 14, 18>
9. <0, 18, 14, 8>
10. <0, 18, 14, 4>
11. <0, 18, 5, 11>
12. <0, 19, 4, 14>
13. <0, 19, 7, 12>
14. <1, 17, 4, 10>
15. <1, 17, 4, 14>
16. <1, 9, 13, 16>
17. <1, 9, 11, 5>
18. <2, 15, 10, 4>
19. <2, 15, 11, 5>
20. <2, 15, 10, 6>
21. <3, 6, 10, 4>
22. <3, 6, 10, 15>
23. <3, 6, 2, 15>
24. <3, 16, 13, 9>
25. <3, 16, 8, 14>
26. <4, 10, 6, 3>

41. <14, 8, 16, 3>
42. <14, 4, 10, 6>
43. <15, 10, 6, 3>
44. <15, 11, 9, 1>
45. <16, 13, 9, 1>

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Among the cycles listed above, there are no chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
