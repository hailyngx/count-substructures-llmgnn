Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <0, 4, 7, 2>. 

Following the steps mentioned earlier, we can determine the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph: 
Step 1: 
Potential 4-cycles: 
- (0, 4, 7, 2)
- (0, 4, 7, 1)
- (0, 4, 6, 8)
- (0, 4, 6, 3)
- (0, 4, 2, 1)
- (1, 7, 2, 0)
- (1, 7, 2, 5)
- (1, 7, 3, 6)
- (2, 1, 7, 8)
- (2, 1, 7, 4)
- (2, 1, 7, 3)
- (3, 1, 7, 4)
- (3, 1, 7, 2)
- (4, 0, 2, 5)
- (4, 0, 9, 5)
- (4, 0, 9, 8)
- (5, 2, 1, 7)
- (5, 2, 7, 8)
- (6, 3, 7, 1)
- (6, 3, 7, 4)
- (6, 3, 7, 2)
- (7, 2, 5, 9)
- (8, 5, 9, 0)
- (8, 5, 9, 3)
- (8, 5, 9, 6)
- (9, 0, 4, 6)

Step 2: 
Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 4, 7, 2> (with chord 1-7)

Step 3: 
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [25].
