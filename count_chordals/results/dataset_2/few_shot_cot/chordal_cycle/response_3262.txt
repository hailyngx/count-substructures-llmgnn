Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 15) (9, 19) (14, 17) (14, 4) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 3) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 2) (12, 7) (12, 3) (19, 9) (19, 1) (19, 3) (10, 7) (10, 15) (10, 8) (10, 18) (15, 9) (15, 10) (15, 8) (15, 16) (13, 17) (13, 3) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 11) (0, 13) (0, 16) (0, 11) (0, 18) (16, 15) (16, 0) (11, 4) (11, 0) (3, 5) (3, 17) (3, 12) (3, 19) (3, 13) (8, 10) (8, 15) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 13) (6, 8) (6, 18) (2, 7) (1, 19) (1, 8) (1, 18) (18, 10) (18, 0) (18, 6) (18, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 13, 16, 11, and node 18
Node 1 is connected to node 19, 8, and node 18
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 17, 12, 19, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 14, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 13, 8, and node 18
Node 7 is connected to node 12, 10, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 10, 15, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 15, and node 19
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 15, 8, and node 18
Node 11 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 17, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 17, and node 4
Node 15 is connected to node 9, 10, 8, and node 16
Node 16 is connected to node 15, and node 0
Node 17 is connected to node 14, 13, and node 3
Node 18 is connected to node 10, 0, 6, and node 1
Node 19 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3

Response:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph: 

<0, (11, 16), 13)>
<1, (8, 18), 19)>
<2, (7, 10), 15)>
<3, (5, 17), 13)>
<4, (5, 14), 11)>
<6, (8, 18), 13)>
<7, (12, 3), 10)>
<10, (15, 8), 18)>
<13, (3, 17), 6)>
<15, (8, 16), 10)>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [0].
