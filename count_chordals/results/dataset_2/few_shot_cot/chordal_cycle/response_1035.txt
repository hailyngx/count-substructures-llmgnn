Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal cycle <1, 6, 12, 3> with chord (6, 12)
- Chordal cycle <3, 12, 6, 1> with chord (12, 1)
- Chordal cycle <6, 1, 17, 4> with chord (1, 17)
- Chordal cycle <17, 4, 13, 16> with chord (4, 16)
- Chordal cycle <4, 13, 14, 9> with chord (13, 14)
- Chordal cycle <14, 9, 18, 10> with chord (9, 10)
- Chordal cycle <9, 18, 8, 16> with chord (18, 16)
- Chordal cycle <16, 8, 17, 1> with chord (8, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles is [8].
