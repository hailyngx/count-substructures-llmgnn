Step 2:
Out of the listed cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, (3, 6), 1>
2. <1, (5, 6), 1>
3. <1, (5, 2), 1>
4. <1, (9, 6), 1>
5. <1, (9, 8), 1>
6. <1, (3, 4), 1>
7. <3, (1, 5), 3>
8. <3, (1, 6), 3>
9. <3, (6, 2), 3>
10. <3, (5, 6), 3>
11. <3, (5, 2), 3>
12. <3, (5, 1), 3>
13. <3, (4, 8), 3>
14. <4, (3, 5), 4>
15. <4, (3, 8), 4>
16. <6, (1, 5), 6>
17. <6, (1, 3), 6>
18. <6, (1, 5), 4, 8, 3, 6>
19. <6, (1, 3), 4, 5, 3, 6>
20. <6, (1, 5), 2, 3, 4, 8, 1, 6>
21. <6, (1, 3), 4, 5, 2, 1, 6>
22. <6, (1, 5), 2, 1, 6>
23. <6, (1, 5), 3, 4, 1, 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we get a total of [24].
