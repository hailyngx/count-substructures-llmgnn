Response:
Step 1: List of cycles with length 4 or more:

1. Cycle <5, 1, 4, 0, 5>
2. Cycle <5, 9, 2, 4, 0, 5>
3. Cycle <5, 9, 3, 2, 4, 0, 5>
4. Cycle <5, 7, 3, 0, 4, 1, 5>
5. Cycle <5, 6, 7, 0, 4, 1, 5>
6. Cycle <9, 5, 7, 0, 4, 1, 9>
7. Cycle <9, 5, 6, 7, 0, 4, 1, 9>
8. Cycle <9, 8, 7, 0, 4, 1, 9>
9. Cycle <9, 8, 4, 2, 3, 9>
10. Cycle <9, 8, 7, 3, 2, 4, 9>
11. Cycle <4, 1, 9, 8, 7, 3, 2, 4>
12. Cycle <4, 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 0, 5>
13. Cycle <4, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 4>
14. Cycle <4, 0, 7, 5, 6, 1, 9>
15. Cycle <4, 0, 5, 7, 6, 1, 4>
16. Cycle <4, 2, 3, 7, 5, 6, 1, 4>
17. Cycle <4, 2, 3, 0, 5, 7, 8, 4>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- The chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <5, 9, 2, 4, 0, 5> with chord (2, 4).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found, which is <5, 9, 2, 4, 0, 5> with chord (2, 4).
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
