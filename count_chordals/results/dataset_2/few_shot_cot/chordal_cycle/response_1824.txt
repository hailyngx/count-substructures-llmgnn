Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. <2, 5, 9, 6>
2. <3, 1, 2, 5>
3. <3, 1, 2, 6>
4. <3, 1, 2, 8>
5. <3, 1, 2, 5>
6. <3, 1, 2, 6>
7. <3, 1, 2, 8>
8. <4, 5, 9, 6>
9. <4, 9, 8, 3>
10. <4, 9, 8, 2>
11. <4, 8, 2, 6>
12. <6, 9, 8, 3>
13. <6, 9, 8, 2>
14. <7, 5, 2, 6> 
15. <7, 5, 9, 6>
16. <7, 9, 8, 3>
17. <7, 9, 8, 4>
18. <8, 3, 1, 2>
19. <8, 3, 1, 5>
20. <4, 0, 9, 5>
21. <4, 0, 9, 6>
22. <4, 0, 7, 3>
23. <4, 0, 7, 5>
24. <0, 9, 5, 7>
25. <0, 9, 5, 4>
26. <0, 9, 6, 2>
27. <0, 9, 6, 4>
28. <0, 7, 3, 1>
29. <0, 7, 3, 8>

Step 2:
Checking the cycles for exactly one chord:
- <2, 5, 9, 6> has a chord (5, 9)
- <4, 5, 9, 6> has a chord (5, 9)
- <7, 5, 9, 6> has a chord (5, 9)
- <7, 9, 8, 4> has a chord (8, 4)
- <0, 9, 5, 7> has a chord (9, 5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [24]

Therefore, there are 24 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
