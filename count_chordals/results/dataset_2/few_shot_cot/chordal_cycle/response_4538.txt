Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 2, 8, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 3, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (1, 4, 6, 2, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 8, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 6: (2, 8, 3, 6, 2)
- Cycle 7: (3, 7, 4, 6, 3)
- Cycle 8: (0, 8, 3, 6, 0)

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed in Step 1, only Cycle 1: (5, 1, 2, 5) has exactly one chord (1, 2).

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found in the graph is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found with one chord is:
<1, (5, 2), 2>
