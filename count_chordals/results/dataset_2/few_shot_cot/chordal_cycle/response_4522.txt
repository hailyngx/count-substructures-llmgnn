Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <7, 0, 5, 3, 1, 7>
- Cycle 2: <7, 0, 5, 8, 6, 7>
- Cycle 3: <7, 0, 9, 4, 7>
- Cycle 4: <7, 1, 2, 9, 4, 7>
- Cycle 5: <7, 1, 4, 9, 8, 7>
- Cycle 6: <7, 1, 4, 2, 9, 7>
- Cycle 7: <7, 1, 4, 9, 0, 7>
- Cycle 8: <1, 4, 9, 8, 6, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 4, 9, 2, 5, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 4, 9, 0, 7, 1>
- Cycle 11: <1, 2, 9, 8, 6, 1>
- Cycle 12: <1, 2, 9, 0, 7, 1>
- Cycle 13: <1, 2, 5, 8, 3, 1>
- Cycle 14: <1, 2, 5, 7, 0, 1>
- Cycle 15: <1, 2, 5, 3, 8, 1>
- Cycle 16: <1, 2, 5, 0, 7, 1>

Step 2:
Identifying the cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: <7, 0, (5, 8), 6, 7>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: <7, (0, 9), 4, 7>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: <7, 1, 2, (9, 4), 7>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: <7, 1, 4, (9, 2), 7>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: <7, 1, (4, 9), 0, 7>
- Cycle 8 has one chord: <1, 4, 9, 8, (6, 1)>
- Cycle 9 has one chord: <1, 4, 9, (2, 5), 1>
- Cycle 11 has one chord: <1, 2, 9, 8, (6, 1)>
- Cycle 13 has one chord: <1, 2, (5, 8), 3, 1>
- Cycle 14 has one chord: <1, 2, 5, 7, (0, 1)>
- Cycle 15 has one chord: <1, 2, 5, (3, 8), 1>

Step 3:
Counting the chordless cycles: 
There are 16 cycles listed and 10 of them have exactly one chord. 
Thus, the number of chordless cycles is [16-10 = 6].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<7, 0, 5, 3, 1, 7>
<7, 0, 5, 8, 6, 7>
<7, 0, 9, 4, 7>
<1, 2, 9, 8, 6, 1>
<1, 2, 5, 7, 0, 1>
<1, 2, 5, 3, 8, 1>
