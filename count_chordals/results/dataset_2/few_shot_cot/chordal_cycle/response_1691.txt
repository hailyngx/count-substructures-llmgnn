Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 9> with 1 chord: (2, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for a chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 9> with 1 chord: (2, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
