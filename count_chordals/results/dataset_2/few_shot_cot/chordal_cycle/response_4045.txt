Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- <0, 4, 7, 5, 12>
- <0, 4, 9, 3, 2>
- <0, 4, 14, 13, 1>
- <0, 7, 10, 14, 11>
- <0, 1, 13, 14, 11>
- <0, 3, 9, 11, 12>
- <4, 7, 10, 14, 13>
- <4, 11, 13, 1, 12>
- <4, 14, 11, 12, 5>
- <7, 10, 14, 13, 1>
- <7, 5, 12, 11, 13>
- <9, 3, 2, 10, 14>
- <11, 13, 1, 8, 6>
- <13, 14, 10, 2, 3>
- <14, 11, 12, 5, 7>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are: 
- <0, (4, 12), 7, 5>
- <0, (4, 3), 9, 2>
- <0, (4, 14), 13, 1>
- <0, (7, 10), 14, 11>
- <0, (1, 13), 14, 11>
- <0, (3, 9), 11, 12>
- <4, (7, 10), 14, 13>
- <4, (11, 13), 1, 12>
- <4, (14, 11), 12, 5>
- <7, (10, 14), 13, 1>
- <7, (5, 12), 11, 13>
- <9, (3, 2), 10, 14>
- <11, (13, 1), 8, 6>
- <13, (14, 10), 2, 3>
- <14, (11, 12), 5, 7>

Step 3: 
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles is [15].
