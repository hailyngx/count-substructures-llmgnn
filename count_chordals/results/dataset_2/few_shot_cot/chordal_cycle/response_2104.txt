Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - The cycles in the graph are:
            - Cycle 1: <5, 15, 3, 5>
            - Cycle 2: <5, 15, 9, 7, 16, 4, 0, 13, 8, 19, 11, 6>
            - Cycle 3: <5, 15, 10, 1, 17, 8, 19, 11, 6>
            - Cycle 4: <5, 15, 10, 12, 16, 7, 9, 15>
            - Cycle 5: <3, 5, 15, 10, 1, 17, 8, 19, 11, 6>
            - Cycle 6: <3, 15, 9, 7, 16, 4, 0, 13, 8, 19, 11, 6>
            - Cycle 7: <3, 15, 10, 1, 17, 8, 19, 11, 6>
            - Cycle 8: <9, 15, 10, 1, 17, 8, 19, 11, 6>
            - Cycle 9: <9, 15, 3, 5, 15>
            - Cycle 10: <10, 15, 3, 5, 15>
            - Cycle 11: <10, 15, 9, 7, 16, 4, 0, 13, 8, 19, 11, 6>
            - Cycle 12: <10, 1, 17, 3, 5, 15>
            - Cycle 13: <10, 1, 8, 19, 11, 6>
            - Cycle 14: <8, 13, 0, 4, 16, 12, 10, 1>
            - Cycle 15: <8, 19, 11, 6, 14, 3, 15, 9>
            - Cycle 16: <16, 4, 0, 13, 8, 19, 11, 6>
            - Cycle 17: <16, 12, 10, 1, 17, 3, 15, 9>
            - Cycle 18: <19, 11, 6, 14, 3, 15, 9, 7>
            
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
            - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 15, 10, 1, (17, 8), 19, 11, 6>
            
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - Number of chordless cycles: [17]
