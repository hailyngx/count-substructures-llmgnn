Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles with 4 or more nodes in the graph:
- Cycle with nodes 0, 1, 3, 6 
- Cycle with nodes 1, 6, 13, 12 
- Cycle with nodes 3, 6, 13, 12 
- Cycle with nodes 5, 8, 6, 13 

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 0, 1, 3, 6 has a chord: (1, 6) - Chordal 4-cycle <0, 1, 3, 6, (1, 6)>
- Cycle 1, 6, 13, 12 has a chord: (1, 13) - Chordal 4-cycle <1, 6, 13, 12, (1, 13)>
- Cycle 3, 6, 13, 12 has a chord: (3, 13) - Chordal 4-cycle <3, 6, 13, 12, (3, 13)>
- Cycle 5, 8, 6, 13 has a chord: (5, 6) - Chordal 4-cycle <5, 8, 6, 13, (5, 8)>

Step 3:
Final count of chordles 4-cycles: [0]
