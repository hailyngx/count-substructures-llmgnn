Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <5, 1, 7, 2>
- <5, 1, 12, 4>
- <5, 16, 15, 0>
- <9, 14, 11, 5>

- <17, 10, 7, 2>
- <1, 7, 2, 6>
- <1, 12, 4, 13>
- <1, 12, 4, 19>
- <14, 5, 11, 9>
- <16, 15, 8, 17>
- <19, 4, 12, 1>
- <3, 19, 4, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 13 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [13].
