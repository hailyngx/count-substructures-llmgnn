Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 0: (0, 4, 7, 5, 11, 10)
- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7)
- Cycle 2: (0, 4, 14, 7, 5, 3)
- Cycle 3: (0, 9, 10, 6, 5, 7)
- Cycle 4: (0, 9, 13, 2, 4, 7)

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 0 has one chord: (5, 10)
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (5, 10)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (2, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of 5 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, (5, 10)>
<1, (4, 7)>
<2, (4, 7)>
<3, (5, 10)>
<4, (2, 7)>
