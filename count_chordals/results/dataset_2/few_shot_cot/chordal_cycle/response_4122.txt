Response:
Let's identify the chordal 4-cycles in the given graph using the steps provided earlier:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or longer in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 9, 6, 3, 8, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 9, 10, 4, 7, 8>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 13, 2, 5, 7, 8>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 13, 11, 5, 7, 8>
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 13, 14, 7, 5, 2>
- Cycle 6: <0, 8, 3, 9, 6, 3, 10>
- Cycle 7: <0, 8, 13, 1, 9, 6, 3>
- Cycle 8: <0, 8, 13, 14, 7, 5, 2>
- Cycle 9: <0, 14, 7, 4, 10, 12, 11>
- Cycle 10: <1, 13, 11, 12, 10, 9, 6>
- Cycle 11: <2, 13, 1, 9, 6, 3, 10>
- Cycle 12: <2, 13, 14, 7, 5, 11, 12>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 1, 13, 2, 5, 7, 8> has a chord (1, 5).
- The cycle <0, 1, 13, 14, 7, 5, 2> has a chord (1, 7).
- The cycle <0, 8, 13, 1, 9, 6, 3> has a chord (8, 9).
- The cycle <0, 14, 7, 4, 10, 12, 11> has a chord (7, 10).
- The cycle <1, 13, 11, 12, 10, 9, 6> has a chord (9, 12).
- The cycle <2, 13, 1, 9, 6, 3, 10> has a chord (2, 10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 1, 13, 2, 5, 7, 8> (Chord: (1, 5))
- <0, 1, 13, 14, 7, 5, 2> (Chord: (1, 7))
- <0, 8, 13, 1, 9, 6, 3> (Chord: (8, 9))
- <0, 14, 7, 4, 10, 12, 11> (Chord: (7, 10))
- <1, 13, 11, 12, 10, 9, 6> (Chord: (9, 12))
- <2, 13, 1, 9, 6, 3, 10> (Chord: (2, 10))
