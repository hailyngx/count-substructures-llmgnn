Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 5 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 1 - 9 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 1 - 2 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 1 - 9 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 5: 1 - 5 - 2 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 9 - 6 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 7: 1 - 9 - 7 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 8: 2 - 5 - 3 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 9: 4 - 9 - 6 - 0 - 4
- Cycle 10: 4 - 9 - 7 - 3 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (1, 2)
- Cycle 2 has no chords
- Cycle 3 has no chords
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (5, 3)
- Cycle 6 has no chords
- Cycle 7 has no chords
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 9 has no chords
- Cycle 10 has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 6.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, 1, 5, 2>
- <0, 1, 9, 6>
- <0, 1, 2, 5>
- <1, 9, 6, 4>
- <1, 9, 7, 3>
- <4, 9, 6, 0>
