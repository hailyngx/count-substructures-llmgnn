The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 4, 0>
2. Cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 6, 0>
3. Cycle 3: <0, 8, 5, 6, 0>
4. Cycle 4: <1, 5, 6, 7, 1>
5. Cycle 5: <1, 6, 8, 5, 1>
6. Cycle 6: <3, 5, 6, 7, 3>
7. Cycle 7: <3, 6, 8, 5, 3>
8. Cycle 8: <4, 9, 8, 5, 4>
9. Cycle 9: <5, 6, 8, 9, 5>
10. Cycle 10: <4, 7, 6, 5, 4>
11. Cycle 11: <4, 7, 6, 8, 4>
12. Cycle 12: <8, 4, 1, 6, 8>
13. Cycle 13: <9, 4, 1, 5, 9>
14. Cycle 14: <4, 1, 0, 5, 4>
15. Cycle 15: <8, 4, 1, 0, 8>
16. Cycle 16: <4, 1, 6, 5, 4>
17. Cycle 17: <7, 6, 1, 5, 7>
18. Cycle 18: <5, 1, 0, 3, 5>
19. Cycle 19: <8, 0, 3, 5, 8>
20. Cycle 20: <5, 0, 3, 6, 5>
21. Cycle 21: <0, 3, 6, 8, 0>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
<0, 5, 1, 4, 0>, chord: (5, 4)

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [20].
