Response:
Step 1: 
- We start by listing all cycles of length 4 or more where every edge exists. 

From the given edges and adjacency list, we can find the following cycles:
1. Cycle: 3-17-2-11-3
2. Cycle: 5-9-16-19-5
3. Cycle: 5-9-12-2-5
4. Cycle: 5-9-19-24-5
5. Cycle: 5-12-2-11-5
6. Cycle: 5-28-14-24-5
7. Cycle: 5-13-8-25-5
8. Cycle: 5-13-11-14-5
9. Cycle: 5-21-27-26-5
10. Cycle: 8-13-11-2-8
11. Cycle: 15-19-16-9-15
12. Cycle: 15-19-24-22-15
13. Cycle: 15-18-1-22-15
14. Cycle: 15-18-20-9-15
15. Cycle: 15-17-2-11-15
16. Cycle: 21-5-9-12-21
17. Cycle: 21-5-28-14-21
18. Cycle: 21-27-26-10-21
19. Cycle: 18-15-19-24-18
20. Cycle: 18-15-9-16-18
21. Cycle: 18-15-17-3-18
22. Cycle: 18-20-9-5-18
23. Cycle: 19-16-9-5-19
24. Cycle: 19-16-9-12-19
25. Cycle: 19-15-18-20-19
26. Cycle: 19-24-14-28-19
27. Cycle: 19-24-22-1-19
28. Cycle: 24-4-22-1-24
29. Cycle: 24-4-10-26-24
30. Cycle: 24-22-1-18-24
31. Cycle: 24-14-28-5-24
32. Cycle: 26-10-4-22-26
33. Cycle: 26-25-8-13-26
34. Cycle: 26-25-0-6-26
35. Cycle: 26-25-0-23-26
36. Cycle: 26-21-5-9-26

Step 2: 
- Now, we check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Step 3:
- Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The unique chordal 4-cycles are: 
<5, 9, 16, 19>
<5, 9, 12, 2>
<5, 12, 28, 14>
<15, 19, 24, 18>
