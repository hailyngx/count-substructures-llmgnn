Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle <6, 1, 7, 2>  (Length: 4)
- Cycle <6, 1, 8, 9, 2> (Length: 5)
- Cycle <9, 8, 4, 5, 6> (Length: 5)
- Cycle <9, 8, 7, 2, 4> (Length: 5)
- Cycle <1, 8, 4, 5, 6> (Length: 5)
- Cycle <1, 7, 2, 4, 5> (Length: 5)
- Cycle <3, 9, 8, 4, 2> (Length: 5)
- Cycle <3, 9, 8, 7, 2> (Length: 5)
- Cycle <3, 0, 9, 8, 7> (Length: 5)
- Cycle <3, 0, 9, 8, 4> (Length: 5)
- Cycle <3, 0, 6, 5, 4> (Length: 5)
- Cycle <3, 0, 6, 1, 7> (Length: 5)
- Cycle <5, 4, 8, 7, 2> (Length: 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- There is no cycle with exactly one chord in the given graph.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 13 chordless cycles found.

So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [13].
