Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, but we are interested in those with exactly one chord. 

Step 2:
One of the unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph is <3, 27, 7, 17>. It has only one chord, which is the edge between nodes 7 and 17.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
