- Cycle 7: <1, 9, 2, 3, 7>
- Cycle 8: <1, 9, 16, 5, 7>
- Cycle 9: <11, 16, 5, 7, 19>
- Cycle 10: <11, 8, 10, 17, 4>
- Cycle 11: <11, 8, 6, 13, 15>
- Cycle 12: <11, 12, 15, 13, 6>
- Cycle 13: <16, 18, 19, 4, 17>
- Cycle 14: <16, 9, 2, 3, 7>
- Cycle 15: <16, 5, 7, 19, 15>
- Cycle 16: <16, 9, 1, 18, 19>
- Cycle 17: <17, 10, 8, 6, 13>
- Cycle 18: <17, 4, 19, 15, 13>

- Cycle 22: <3, 2, 9, 16, 5>
- Cycle 23: <3, 7, 5, 16, 11>
- Cycle 24: <4, 17, 10, 8, 0>
- Cycle 25: <4, 19, 15, 12, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 8, 10, 17, 4> has a chord: edge 8-17
- <0, 11, 16, 5, 7> has a chord: edge 11-16
- <1, 11, 16, 5, 7> has a chord: edge 1-11
- <1, 18, 19, 4, 17> has a chord: edge 18-4
- <1, 9, 2, 3, 7> has a chord: edge 9-3
- <16, 18, 19, 4, 17> has a chord: edge 18-4
- <17, 10, 8, 6, 13> has a chord: edge 10-8
- <19, 4, 17, 10, 8> has a chord: edge 4-10

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles: [25]
