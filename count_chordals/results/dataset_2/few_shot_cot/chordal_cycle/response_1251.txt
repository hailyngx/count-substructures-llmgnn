Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more are:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-3-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-3-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-3-1-0
- Cycle 4: 3-1-6-7-3
- Cycle 5: 3-2-6-7-3
- Cycle 6: 3-8-5-0-3
- Cycle 7: 4-5-7-0-4
- Cycle 8: 4-8-1-6-4
- Cycle 9: 4-7-6-1-4
- Cycle 10: 5-3-1-6-5
- Cycle 11: 5-0-7-4-5
- Cycle 12: 5-8-3-0-5
- Cycle 13: 6-1-3-2-6
- Cycle 14: 6-2-3-1-6
- Cycle 15: 7-0-5-4-7
- Cycle 16: 7-4-8-1-7
- Cycle 17: 7-9-0-5-7
- Cycle 18: 8-3-1-6-8
- Cycle 19: 8-2-3-5-8

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (3, 5), 0>
- Chordal cycle 2: <2, (0, 3), 5>
- Chordal cycle 3: <0, (1, 3), 5>
- Chordal cycle 4: <3, (1, 6), 7>
- Chordal cycle 5: <3, (1, 6), 7>
- Chordal cycle 6: <3, (0, 5), 8>
- Chordal cycle 7: <5, (4, 7), 0>
- Chordal cycle 8: <4, (6, 1), 8>
- Chordal cycle 9: <6, (1, 3), 7>
- Chordal cycle 10: <6, (1, 3), 5>
- Chordal cycle 11: <5, (0, 7), 4>
- Chordal cycle 12: <5, (0, 3), 8>
- Chordal cycle 13: <3, (1, 6), 2>
- Chordal cycle 14: <3, (1, 6), 2>
- Chordal cycle 15: <7, (0, 5), 4>
- Chordal cycle 16: <7, (1, 8), 4>
- Chordal cycle 17: <7, (0, 5), 9>
- Chordal cycle 18: <8, (1, 6), 3>
- Chordal cycle 19: <8, (2, 3), 5>

Step 3:
There are 19 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final count of chordless cycles is [19].
