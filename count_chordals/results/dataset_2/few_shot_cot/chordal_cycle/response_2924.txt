Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- <0, 7, 4, 13> with chord (7, 13)
- <0, 2, 9, 8> with chord (2, 8)
- <1, 6, 3, 4> with chord (6, 4)
- <1, 5, 12, 6> with chord (5, 6)
- <2, 7, 4, 10> with chord (7, 10)
- <2, 9, 11, 10> with chord (9, 10)
- <1, 4, 10, 12> with chord (4, 10)
- <12, 6, 3, 13> with chord (6, 13)

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles are: 
- <0, 7, 4, 13> with chord (7, 13)
- <1, 6, 3, 4> with chord (6, 4)
- <2, 7, 4, 10> with chord (7, 10)
- <12, 6, 3, 13> with chord (6, 13)

Step 3: 
The number of chordless cycles found is [4].
