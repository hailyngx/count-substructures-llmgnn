Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <1, 6, 9, 4> with a chord between nodes 6 and 4.

Following the step-by-step process described earlier:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: <1, 6, 9, 4>
- Cycle 2: <1, 6, 0, 9>
- Cycle 3: <1, 6, 9, 15>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 0, 6>
- Cycle 5: <6, 9, 4, 5>
- Cycle 6: <9, 4, 18, 17>
- Cycle 7: <4, 18, 17, 8>
- Cycle 8: <18, 17, 14, 19>
- Cycle 9: <17, 14, 19, 1>
- Cycle 10: <14, 19, 1, 6>
- Cycle 11: <19, 1, 18, 17>
- Cycle 12: <1, 18, 17, 8>
- Cycle 13: <18, 17, 8, 13>
- Cycle 14: <17, 8, 13, 12>
- Cycle 15: <8, 13, 12, 16>
- Cycle 16: <13, 12, 16, 2>
- Cycle 17: <12, 16, 2, 5>
- Cycle 18: <16, 2, 5, 11>
- Cycle 19: <2, 5, 11, 5>
- Cycle 20: <5, 11, 5, 4>
- Cycle 21: <11, 5, 4, 3>
- Cycle 22: <5, 4, 3, 7>
- Cycle 23: <4, 3, 7, 14>
- Cycle 24: <3, 7, 14, 17>
- Cycle 25: <7, 14, 17, 10>
- Cycle 26: <14, 17, 10, 13>
- Cycle 27: <17, 10, 13, 8>
- Cycle 28: <10, 13, 8, 17>
- Cycle 29: <13, 8, 17, 18>
- Cycle 30: <8, 17, 18, 4>
- Cycle 31: <17, 18, 4, 9>
- Cycle 32: <18, 4, 9, 6>
- Cycle 33: <4, 9, 6, 1>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (6, 4), making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [32].
