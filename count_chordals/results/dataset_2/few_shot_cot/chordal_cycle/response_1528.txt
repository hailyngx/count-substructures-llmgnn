Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <11, 16, 22, 18, 11>
2. <11, 16, 12, 20, 25, 29, 11>
3. <11, 29, 25, 3, 6, 26, 4, 29>
4. <11, 10, 5, 19, 15, 24, 9, 11>
5. <16, 22, 18, 7, 17, 20, 12, 16>
6. <16, 12, 8, 2, 9, 24, 15, 19, 5, 10, 16>
7. <18, 22, 16, 12, 8, 0, 7, 18>
8. <20, 25, 3, 6, 27, 17, 24, 15, 19, 5, 20>

Step 2:
Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. <11, 16, 22, 18, 11> has chord (16, 18)
2. <11, 16, 12, 20, 25, 29, 11> has chord (16, 20)
3. <11, 29, 25, 3, 6, 26, 4, 29> has chord (25, 6)
4. <11, 10, 5, 19, 15, 24, 9, 11> has chord (10, 19)
5. <16, 22, 18, 7, 17, 20, 12, 16> has chord (22, 7)
6. <16, 12, 8, 2, 9, 24, 15, 19, 5, 10, 16> has chord (12, 9)
7. <18, 22, 16, 12, 8, 0, 7, 18> has chord (22, 8)
8. <20, 25, 3, 6, 27, 17, 24, 15, 19, 5, 20> has chord (25, 17)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [8].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<11, 16, 22, 18, 11>
<11, 16, 12, 20, 25, 29, 11>
<11, 29, 25, 3, 6, 26, 4, 29>
<11, 10, 5, 19, 15, 24, 9, 11>
<16, 22, 18, 7, 17, 20, 12, 16>
<16, 12, 8, 2, 9, 24, 15, 19, 5, 10, 16>
<18, 22, 16, 12, 8, 0, 7, 18>
<20, 25, 3, 6, 27, 17, 24, 15, 19, 5, 20>
