Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: <4, 5, 1, 7, 4> with edges (4, 5), (5, 1), (1, 7), and (7, 4).
- Cycle 2: <4, 7, 2, 1, 4> with edges (4, 7), (7, 2), (2, 1), and (1, 4).
- Cycle 3: <4, 8, 2, 7, 4> with edges (4, 8), (8, 2), (2, 7), and (7, 4).
- Cycle 4: <4, 0, 3, 9, 4> with edges (4, 0), (0, 3), (3, 9), and (9, 4).
- Cycle 5: <7, 1, 2, 8, 7> with edges (7, 1), (1, 2), (2, 8), and (8, 7).
- Cycle 6: <0, 6, 4, 7, 0> with edges (0, 6), (6, 4), (4, 7), and (7, 0).

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <4, 5, 1, 7, 4> has a chord between nodes 5 and 7 which is (5, 7).
- <4, 7, 2, 1, 4> has a chord between nodes 7 and 1 which is (7, 1).
- <4, 8, 2, 7, 4> has a chord between nodes 8 and 4 which is (8, 4).
- <4, 0, 3, 9, 4> has a chord between nodes 0 and 3 which is (0, 3).
- <7, 1, 2, 8, 7> has a chord between nodes 1 and 8 which is (1, 8).
- <0, 6, 4, 7, 0> has a chord between nodes 6 and 4 which is (6, 4).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0 since all cycles have exactly one chord.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
