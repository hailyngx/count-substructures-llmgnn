Response:
Following the steps to identify chordal 4-cycles in the provided graph:

Step 1: List of cycles with four or more nodes:

<0, 12, 4, 2, 8>
<0, 12, 4, 10, 6>
<0, 12, 11, 13, 1>
<0, 14, 3, 13, 1>
<1, 9, 2, 4, 12>
<1, 9, 2, 8, 5>
<2, 4, 10, 6, 7>
<2, 8, 5, 14, 7>
<3, 7, 6, 10, 4>
<3, 9, 2, 8, 5>
<4, 10, 6, 7, 12>
<5, 8, 9, 3, 14>
<6, 10, 4, 12, 7>
<7, 12, 0, 14, 5>
<9, 2, 8, 5, 11>
<9, 12, 7, 6, 10>
<10, 6, 5, 11, 13>
<11, 5, 8, 9, 12>
<13, 1, 9, 12, 7>
<14, 5, 11, 13, 3>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
The cycle <0, 12, 11, 13, 1> contains exactly one chord (12, 1) and is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the count is [1].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is <0, 12, 11, 13>, with the chord (12, 1), and the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
