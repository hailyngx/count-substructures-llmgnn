Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are two cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. Cycle 1: (1, 5, 2, 7, 1)
2. Cycle 2: (2, 5, 4, 7, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Both cycles have exactly one chord:
1. Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (2, 7), 5>, chord: (2, 7)
2. Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (4, 7), 5>, chord: (4, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As no chordless cycles were found, the final count is [0].
