Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 11, 22, 14>
2. <0, 19, 16, 1>
3. <0, 19, 23, 8>
4. <1, 6, 21, 27>
5. <1, 6, 7, 8>
6. <2, 13, 26, 22>
7. <2, 13, 25, 12>
8. <2, 13, 25, 5>
9. <3, 9, 24, 15>
10. <3, 4, 5, 25>
11. <4, 12, 13, 26>
12. <4, 12, 25, 5>

28. <16, 19, 23, 5>
29. <16, 27, 21, 6>
30. <20, 22, 26, 13>
31. <20, 22, 14, 17>
32. <20, 18, 26, 21>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 11, 22, 14>: Chords: (11, 14)
- <0, 19, 16, 1>: Chords: (16, 19)
- <1, 6, 21, 27>: Chords: (6, 21)
- <2, 13, 26, 22>: Chords: (13, 22)
- <2, 13, 25, 12>: Chords: (13, 12)
- <3, 9, 24, 15>: Chords: (9, 24)
- <4, 12, 13, 26>: Chords: (13, 26)
- <5, 23, 8, 7>: Chords: (8, 23)
- <6, 7, 8, 23>: Chords: (7, 8)
- <9, 3, 4, 12>: Chords: (4, 12)
- <15, 24, 9, 3>: Chords: (9, 24)
- <20, 22, 26, 13>: Chords: (22, 26)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [20]
