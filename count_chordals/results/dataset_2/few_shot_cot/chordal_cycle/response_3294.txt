Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 7) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 5, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 9, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 2, 0, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 5, 0> 
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 4, 8> 
- Cycle 3: <1, 6, 8, 4> 
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 8, 2> 
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 9, 3> 
- Cycle 6: <3, 5, 4, 8> 
- Cycle 7: <3, 4, 8, 2> 
- Cycle 8: <3, 4, 5, 0> 
- Cycle 9: <4, 8, 2, 9> 
- Cycle 10: <4, 5, 0, 8> 
- Cycle 11: <8, 2, 0, 9> 
- Cycle 12: <8, 0, 5, 3> 
- Cycle 13: <8, 4, 5, 3> 
- Cycle 14: <8, 4, 3, 1> 
- Cycle 15: <8, 9, 2, 1> 
- Cycle 16: <8, 6, 1, 3> 
- Cycle 17: <5, 4, 8, 6> 
- Cycle 18: <5, 0, 2, 9> 
- Cycle 19: <6, 1, 3, 9> 
- Cycle 20: <6, 8, 4, 3> 
- Cycle 21: <6, 7, 9, 1> 
- Cycle 22: <7, 1, 3, 9> 

Step 2: 
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Only Cycle 1: <1, 3, 5, 0> has exactly one chord: (3, 5).
- Only Cycle 2: <1, 3, 4, 8> has exactly one chord: (3, 4).
- Only Cycle 3: <1, 6, 8, 4> has exactly one chord: (6, 8).
- Only Cycle 4: <1, 9, 8, 2> has exactly one chord: (9, 8).
- Only Cycle 5: <1, 7, 9, 3> has exactly one chord: (7, 9).
- No other cycles have exactly one chord.

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is 5.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
