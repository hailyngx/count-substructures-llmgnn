Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 7, 5>
- <0, 4, 7, 9>
- <0, 4, 1, 5>
- <0, 4, 1, 8>
- <0, 4, 3, 5>
- <0, 4, 3, 9>
- <0, 8, 6, 1>
- <0, 8, 6, 7>
- <0, 2, 1, 5>
- <0, 2, 1, 8>
- <0, 2, 9, 7>
- <1, 4, 7, 6>
- <1, 4, 7, 5>
- <1, 4, 3, 5>
- <1, 4, 3, 6>
- <1, 6, 7, 5>
- <1, 6, 7, 4>
- <1, 6, 8, 0>
- <1, 6, 8, 9>
- <1, 2, 0, 4>
- <1, 2, 0, 8>
- <1, 2, 9, 7>
- <3, 4, 7, 6>
- <3, 4, 7, 5>
- <3, 4, 1, 5>
- <3, 4, 1, 8>
- <3, 0, 4, 7>
- <3, 0, 4, 1>
- <3, 0, 8, 6>
- <3, 0, 8, 9>
- <3, 6, 7, 5>
- <3, 6, 7, 4>
- <3, 6, 1, 5>
- <3, 6, 1, 8>
- <7, 4, 1, 5>
- <7, 4, 1, 8>
- <7, 4, 3, 5>
- <7, 4, 3, 9>
- <7, 6, 1, 5>
- <7, 6, 1, 8>
- <7, 6, 8, 0>
- <7, 6, 8, 9>
- <7, 9, 8, 0>
- <7, 9, 8, 6>
- <8, 0, 4, 3>
- <8, 0, 4, 1>
- <8, 0, 6, 7>
- <8, 0, 6, 1>
- <8, 1, 4, 3>
- <8, 1, 4, 7>
- <8, 1, 6, 7>
- <8, 1, 6, 3>
- <8, 9, 7, 4>
- <8, 9, 7, 6>
- <9, 7, 4, 1>
- <9, 7, 4, 3>
- <9, 7, 6, 8>
- <9, 7, 6, 1>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, 4, 7, 5, (0, 7)>
- <0, 4, 7, 9, (0, 9)>
- <0, 4, 1, 5, (1, 4)>
- <0, 4, 1, 8, (1, 8)>
- <0, 4, 3, 5, (0, 5)>

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
