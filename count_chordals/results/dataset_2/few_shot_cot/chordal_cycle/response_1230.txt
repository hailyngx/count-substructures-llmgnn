- <0, 13, 1, 4>: Chord (13, 1)
- <1, 4, 11, 10>: Chord (4, 11)
- <1, 4, 9, 13>: Chord (4, 9)
- <1, 10, 6, 8>: Chord (10, 6)
- <1, 12, 11, 4>: Chord (12, 11)
- <2, 5, 13, 9>: Chord (5, 9)
- <2, 7, 4, 9>: Chord (7, 9)
- <3, 11, 14, 1>: Chord (11, 14)
- <4, 7, 2, 13>: Chord (7, 2)
- <5, 7, 2, 8>: Chord (7, 2)
- <5, 13, 9, 12>: Chord (13, 9)
- <6, 10, 11, 4>: Chord (10, 11)
- <9, 4, 1, 13>: Chord (4, 1)
- <9, 11, 14, 2>: Chord (11, 14)
- <10, 11, 4, 9>: Chord (11, 4)
