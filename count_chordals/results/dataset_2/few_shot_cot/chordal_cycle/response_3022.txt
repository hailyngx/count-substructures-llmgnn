Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 5, 15, 0>
- Cycle <0, 15, 14, 1, 4, 7, 6, 13, 0>
- Cycle <2, 16, 7, 4, 1, 14, 15, 5, 0, 13, 6, 12, 10, 3, 19, 18, 16>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 5, 15, 0> has no chord.
- Cycle <0, 15, 14, 1, 4, 7, 6, 13, 0> has no chord.
- Cycle <2, 16, 7, 4, 1, 14, 15, 5, 0, 13, 6, 12, 10, 3, 19, 18, 16> has a chord: edge (2, 8) is a chord.

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, 5, 15, 0>
<0, 15, 14, 1, 4, 7, 6, 13, 0>
