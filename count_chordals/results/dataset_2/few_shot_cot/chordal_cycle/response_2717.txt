Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: (3, 1, 8, 5, 3)
2. Cycle 2: (2, 0, 8, 1, 3, 2)
3. Cycle 3: (4, 9, 5, 8, 4)
4. Cycle 4: (6, 0, 8, 7, 6)
5. Cycle 5: (7, 0, 8, 5, 7)
6. Cycle 6: (4, 3, 1, 8, 4)
7. Cycle 7: (2, 0, 6, 7, 2)
8. Cycle 8: (2, 7, 8, 5, 2)
9. Cycle 9: (4, 9, 0, 2, 4)
10. Cycle 10: (5, 9, 4, 2, 5)
11. Cycle 11: (7, 2, 4, 0, 7)
12. Cycle 12: (7, 6, 2, 0, 7)
13. Cycle 13: (6, 0, 2, 4, 6)
14. Cycle 14: (7, 2, 0, 8, 7)
15. Cycle 15: (4, 3, 9, 5, 4)
16. Cycle 16: (3, 1, 4, 9, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
1. <3, (1, 8), 5, 4>
2. <2, (0, 8), 1, 3>
3. <4, (9, 5), 8, 1>
4. <6, (0, 8), 7, 2>
5. <7, (0, 8), 5, 6>
6. <4, (3, 1), 8, 4>
7. <2, (0, 6), 7, 2>
8. <7, (2, 8), 5, 2>
9. <4, (9, 0), 2, 5>
10. <5, (9, 4), 2, 9>
11. <7, (2, 4), 0, 7>
12. <7, (6, 2), 0, 7>
13. <6, (0, 2), 4, 6>
14. <7, (0, 8), 2, 5>
15. <4, (3, 9), 5, 4>
16. <3, (1, 4), 9, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [16].
