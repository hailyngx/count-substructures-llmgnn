Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordless cycles: <0, 9, 5, 1, 3>, <0, 9, 5, 7, 2>, <0, 9, 13, 6, 4>, <1, 5, 11, 0, 10>, <1, 7, 4, 6, 12>, <1, 3, 13, 6, 12>, <2, 7, 4, 6, 12>, <4, 7, 11, 5, 1>, <6, 4, 7, 11, 10>, <8, 1, 7, 4, 12>, <8, 12, 6, 13, 9>, <10, 13, 1, 5, 9>, <12, 4, 7, 11, 10>, <13, 9, 5, 1, 3>, <13, 10, 0, 8, 12>

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles = [15]
