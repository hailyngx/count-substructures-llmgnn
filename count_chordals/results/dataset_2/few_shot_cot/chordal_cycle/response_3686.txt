Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all edges existing:
- <0, 1, 14, 2, 13>
- <0, 1, 16, 13, 5>
- <0, 1, 15, 12, 4>
- <0, 8, 3, 10, 5>
- <0, 8, 3, 17, 15>
- <0, 8, 3, 17, 7>
- <0, 9, 17, 15, 12>
- <0, 10, 5, 13, 16>
- <0, 10, 5, 7, 17>
- <0, 10, 18, 10, 5>
- <1, 15, 12, 4, 5>
- <1, 14, 2, 13, 5>
- <1, 14, 2, 7, 17>
- <1, 16, 13, 5, 4>
- <4, 12, 15, 1, 14>
- <5, 10, 18, 10, 3>
- <7, 17, 3, 8, 0>
- <7, 17, 9, 0, 8>
- <7, 17, 15, 1, 16>
- <7, 17, 9, 7, 5>
- <9, 0, 1, 14, 2>
- <9, 7, 2, 13, 5>
- <11, 19, 11, 6, 12>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- In cycle <0, 1, 14, 2, 13>, chord (1, 14) is present.
- In cycle <0, 1, 16, 13, 5>, chord (1, 13) is present.
- In cycle <1, 15, 12, 4, 5>, chord (15, 4) is present.
- In cycle <4, 12, 15, 1, 14>, chord (12, 1) is present.

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found: [21]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, 1, 14, 2> with chord (1, 14)
