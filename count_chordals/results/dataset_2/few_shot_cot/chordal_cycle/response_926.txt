Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 11, 6, 2, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 8, 7, 1, 14, 5>
- Cycle 4: <9, 4, 3, 14, 9>
- Cycle 5: <9, 11, 6, 2, 0, 9>
- Cycle 6: <4, 7, 0, 12, 4>
- Cycle 7: <7, 1, 10, 13, 7>
- Cycle 8: <3, 2, 0, 12, 3>
- Cycle 9: <6, 11, 9, 10, 6>
- Cycle 10: <14, 5, 3, 2, 14>
- Cycle 11: <0, 7, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 12: <13, 10, 1, 7, 0, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 4, 7, 5> has 1 chord: (9, 7)
- <5, 9, 11, 6, 2, 5> has 1 chord: (9, 2)
- <5, 8, 7, 1, 14, 5> has 1 chord: (8, 1)
- <9, 4, 3, 14, 9> has 1 chord: (4, 14)
- <9, 11, 6, 2, 0, 9> has 1 chord: (9, 2)
- <4, 7, 0, 12, 4> has 1 chord: (7, 12)
- <7, 1, 10, 13, 7> has 1 chord: (1, 10)
- <3, 2, 0, 12, 3> has 1 chord: (2, 12)
- <6, 11, 9, 10, 6> has no chord
- <14, 5, 3, 2, 14> has 1 chord: (5, 2)
- <0, 7, 1, 6, 0> has 1 chord: (7, 1)
- <13, 10, 1, 7, 0, 13> has 1 chord: (10, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <6, 11, 9, 10, 6>
