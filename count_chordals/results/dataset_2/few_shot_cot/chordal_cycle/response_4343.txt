Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle with length 4: <0, 5, 1, 9, 0>
- Cycle with length 5: <0, 5, 1, 3, 4, 0>, <0, 5, 1, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle with length 6: <0, 5, 1, 9, 4, 8, 0>, <0, 5, 1, 3, 4, 8, 0>

Step 2: Check for chords in each cycle:
- For cycle <0, 5, 1, 9, 0>: Chord (1, 9) is present.
- For cycle <0, 5, 1, 3, 4, 0>: No chords present.
- For cycle <0, 5, 1, 8, 4, 0>: Chord (1, 4) is present.
- For cycle <0, 5, 1, 9, 4, 8, 0>: Chord (1, 4) is present.
- For cycle <0, 5, 1, 3, 4, 8, 0>: Chord (1, 4) is present.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles = [1]
