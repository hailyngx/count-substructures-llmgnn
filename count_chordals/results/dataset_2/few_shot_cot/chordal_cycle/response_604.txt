Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (2, 5) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 2: 4 - 6 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 3: 7 - 4 - 8 - 7
- Cycle 4: 3 - 7 - 2 - 3

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords
- Cycle 2 has no chords
- Cycle 3 has no chords
- Cycle 4 has no chords

Step 3:
As none of the cycles have chords, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
None.
