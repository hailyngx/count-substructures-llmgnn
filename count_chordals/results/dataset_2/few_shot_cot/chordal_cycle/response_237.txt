Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph along with their chords:
- Cycle <7, 10, 29, 28>: Chord (29, 28)
- Cycle <27, 2, 0, 4>: Chord (2, 4)
- Cycle <8, 17, 13, 19>: Chord (17, 13)
- Cycle <8, 9, 25, 26>: Chord (9, 26)
- Cycle <8, 24, 4, 0>: Chord (24, 0)
- Cycle <8, 24, 4, 22>: Chord (4, 22)
- Cycle <8, 3, 7, 25>: Chord (3, 25)
- Cycle <8, 3, 19, 20>: Chord (3, 20)
- Cycle <8, 3, 19, 13>: Chord (3, 13)
- Cycle <10, 7, 3, 19>: Chord (7, 19)
- Cycle <17, 13, 19, 3>: Chord (13, 19)
- Cycle <17, 13, 26, 25>: Chord (13, 26)
- Cycle <25, 26, 18, 28>: Chord (26, 18)
- Cycle <27, 29, 26, 25>: Chord (29, 25)
- Cycle <27, 29, 10, 7>: Chord (29, 10)
- Cycle <27, 29, 10, 1>: Chord (29, 1)
- Cycle <27, 29, 26, 18>: Chord (29, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Unique chordal 4-cycle: <<7, 10, 29, 28)> with chord (29, 28), <27, 2, 0, 4)> with chord (2, 4), <8, 17, 13, 19)> with chord (17, 13), <8, 9, 25, 26)> with chord (9, 26), <8, 24, 4, 0)> with chord (24, 0), <8, 24, 4, 22)> with chord (4, 22), <8, 3, 7, 25)> with chord (3, 25), <8, 3, 19, 20)> with chord (3, 20), <8, 3, 19, 13)> with chord (3, 13), and <10, 7, 3, 19)> with chord (7, 19).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are a total of [9] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
