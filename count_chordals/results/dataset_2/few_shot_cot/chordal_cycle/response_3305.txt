Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is: <5, (1, 4), 15, 2>

Let's count the number of chordless cycles: 

Step 1: 
- List of cycles of length 4: (5, 9, 7, 0), (5, 9, 7, 8), (5, 1, 18, 7), (5, 1, 18, 14), (5, 1, 14, 12), (9, 16, 13, 10), (9, 16, 17, 13), (9, 7, 18, 2), (9, 7, 18, 1), (2, 18, 7, 0), (2, 18, 7, 8), (18, 14, 12, 19), (18, 14, 12, 4), (3, 5, 1, 14), (3, 5, 1, 4), (3, 11, 19, 12), (3, 11, 19, 10), (3, 6, 3, 5), (3, 6, 3, 8), (11, 19, 12, 4), (11, 19, 12, 14), (11, 8, 3, 5), (11, 8, 3, 6), (0, 7, 9, 5), (0, 7, 9, 16), (7, 18, 2, 15), (7, 18, 2, 1), (7, 0, 15, 2), (7, 0, 15, 1), (1, 5, 9, 7), (1, 5, 9, 16), (1, 18, 7, 0), (1, 18, 7, 8), (1, 14, 12, 4), (1, 14, 12, 19), (1, 4, 12, 14), (15, 2, 18, 14), (15, 2, 18, 7), (15, 0, 7, 18), (15, 0, 7, 8), (10, 13, 17, 16), (10, 13, 16, 9), (10, 19, 11, 3), (10, 19, 11, 8), (13, 17, 16, 9), (13, 17, 16, 10), (13, 16, 9, 5), (13, 16, 9, 7), (4, 1, 5, 9), (4, 1, 18, 7), (4, 12, 14, 18), (4, 12, 14, 1), (12, 14, 18, 7), (12, 14, 18, 2), (12, 19, 11, 3), (12, 19, 11, 8), (16, 9, 5, 1), (16, 9, 7, 0), (16, 10, 13, 17), (16, 10, 13, 16), (16, 17, 13, 10), (16, 17, 13, 16), (19, 11, 3, 5), (19, 11, 3, 6)
  
Step 2:
- Chordal cycles (cycles with exactly one chord): (5, 1, 14, 12, 4), (9, 16, 13, 10, 19), (15, 2, 18, 14, 12)
  
Step 3:
- Number of chordless cycles = Total cycles - Chordal cycles = 44 - 3 = 41

Therefore, the total number of chordless cycles in the graph is [41].
