Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <5, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle <5, 9, 2, 1>
- Cycle <5, 9, 2, 0>
- Cycle <5, 2, 1, 3>
- Cycle <5, 2, 1, 6>
- Cycle <5, 2, 0, 8>
- Cycle <9, 3, 0, 6>
- Cycle <6, 1, 5, 7>
- Cycle <6, 1, 3, 9>
- Cycle <6, 1, 2, 5>
- Cycle <6, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle <1, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle <1, 3, 0, 4>
- Cycle <3, 9, 2, 5>
- Cycle <4, 6, 8, 0>
- Cycle <7, 5, 2, 9>
- Cycle <7, 5, 8, 6>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 9, 2, 1> with chord (5, 1)

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the count is [1].
