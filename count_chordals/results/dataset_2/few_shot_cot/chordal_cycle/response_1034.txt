Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:

- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 4, 9>
- Cycle 2: <1, 6, 9, 11>
- Cycle 3: <1, 11, 7, 5>
- Cycle 4: <1, 14, 4, 0>
- Cycle 5: <2, 5, 8, 10>
- Cycle 6: <2, 12, 9, 4>
- Cycle 7: <3, 10, 11, 7>
- Cycle 8: <3, 13, 7, 11>
- Cycle 9: <4, 9, 11, 12>
- Cycle 10: <4, 12, 13, 2>
- Cycle 11: <4, 14, 10, 8>
- Cycle 12: <5, 7, 11, 1>
- Cycle 13: <5, 8, 10, 14>
- Cycle 14: <7, 11, 9, 6>
- Cycle 15: <10, 14, 0, 4>
- Cycle 16: <12, 9, 6, 1>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycle: 
- <1, 11, 7, 5> with chord (1, 5)
- <2, 5, 8, 10> with chord (2, 8)
- <3, 10, 11, 7> with chord (3, 11)
- <5, 7, 11, 1> with chord (5, 11)
- <4, 14, 10, 8> with chord (4, 10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
