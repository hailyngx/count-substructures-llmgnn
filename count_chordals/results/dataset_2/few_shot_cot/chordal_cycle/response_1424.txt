Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 13) (10, 5) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 13) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 8) (12, 5) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (14, 5) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 13) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 6) (13, 14)

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph, namely:
1. <0, 5, 10, 2>
2. <0, 5, 14, 4>
3. <0, 5, 9, 1>
4. <0, 8, 1, 9>
5. <0, 8, 2, 7>
6. <0, 6, 4, 7>
7. <1, 9, 5, 10>
8. <1, 9, 13, 3>
9. <1, 14, 11, 3>
10. <1, 14, 7, 4>
11. <2, 4, 7, 8>
12. <2, 7, 14, 4>
13. <3, 13, 6, 0>
14. <3, 13, 11, 14>
15. <4, 7, 14, 13>
16. <5, 9, 1, 8>
17. <5, 9, 13, 6>
18. <5, 12, 0, 8>
19. <7, 4, 6, 0>
20. <8, 1, 9, 5>
21. <10, 5, 9, 1>
22. <11, 3, 13, 14>
23. <14, 5, 9, 1>

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 5, 9, 1, (10, 2)>
2. <0, 5, 14, 4, (7, 8)>
3. <0, 6, 4, 7, (13, 9)>
4. <1, 9, 5, 10, (2, 13)>
5. <1, 9, 13, 3, (11, 14)>
6. <1, 14, 11, 3, (13, 4)>
7. <2, 7, 14, 4, (13, 8)>
8. <5, 9, 1, 8, (13, 6)>
9. <10, 5, 9, 1, (13, 6)>

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
