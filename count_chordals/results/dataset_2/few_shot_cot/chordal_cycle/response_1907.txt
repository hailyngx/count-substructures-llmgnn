Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 12, 1, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 14, 10, 6, 4, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 4, 8, 5, 12, 1>
- Cycle 5: <3, 10, 6, 4, 9, 3>
- Cycle 6: <4, 9, 13, 5, 14, 10, 6, 4>
- Cycle 7: <5, 8, 4, 7, 1, 12, 5>
- Cycle 8: <5, 8, 6, 10, 3, 9, 4, 7, 1, 12, 5>
- Cycle 9: <5, 8, 6, 10, 14, 11, 7, 1, 12, 5>
- Cycle 10: <5, 12, 1, 7, 4, 9, 13, 5>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 5>, chord: (0, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 5, 12, 1>, chord: (5, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 5, 14, 10>, chord: (5, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, 10, 6, 4>, chord: (10, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, 9, 13, 5>, chord: (9, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, 8, 4, 7>, chord: (5, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, 8, 6, 10>, chord: (8, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, 12, 1, 7>, chord: (12, 1)

Step 3:
There are a total of 8 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [8].
