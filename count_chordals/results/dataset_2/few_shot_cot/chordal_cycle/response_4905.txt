Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 11, 0> (Chord: 1-5)
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 13, 6, 11, 0> (Chord: 6-13)
- Cycle 3: <3, 13, 6, 11, 10, 4, 17, 3> (Chord: 10-17)
- Cycle 4: <4, 10, 11, 6, 13, 8, 17, 4> (Chord: 8-13)
- Cycle 5: <5, 18, 2, 16, 14, 19, 11, 0, 5> (Chord: 2-14)
- Cycle 6: <7, 3, 13, 8, 16, 14, 19, 11, 7> (Chord: 8-14)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 11, 0> has one chord (1-5)
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 13, 6, 11, 0> has one chord (6-13)
- Cycle 3: <3, 13, 6, 11, 10, 4, 17, 3> has one chord (10-17)
- Cycle 4: <4, 10, 11, 6, 13, 8, 17, 4> has one chord (8-13)
- Cycle 5: <5, 18, 2, 16, 14, 19, 11, 0, 5> has one chord (2-14)
- Cycle 6: <7, 3, 13, 8, 16, 14, 19, 11, 7> has one chord (8-14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:
There are no chordless cycles.

Final count: [6]
