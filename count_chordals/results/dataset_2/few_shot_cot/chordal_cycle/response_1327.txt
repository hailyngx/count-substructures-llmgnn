Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-6-1-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-9-5-0
- Cycle 3: 1-6-2-3-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-5-9-1
- Cycle 5: 2-6-5-3-2
- Cycle 6: 2-6-1-0-2
- Cycle 7: 2-4-9-5-2
- Cycle 8: 3-5-9-4-3
- Cycle 9: 4-9-8-2-4
- Cycle 10: 4-0-1-7-4

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (6, 3)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (2, 8)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (0, 1)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of [5] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, (5, 9), 3>
- <6, (6, 3), 2>
- <8, (1, 8), 0>
- <10, (6, 9), 1>
- <9, (0, 1), 7>
