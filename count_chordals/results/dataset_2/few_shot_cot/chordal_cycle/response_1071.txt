Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles with length 4 or more in the graph are: 
1. (4, 7, 8, 5, 4)
2. (4, 9, 8, 5, 4)
3. (4, 9, 6, 5, 4)
4. (4, 9, 3, 5, 4)
5. (7, 4, 9, 8, 7)
6. (6, 9, 3, 1, 6)
7. (6, 9, 8, 1, 6)
8. (6, 9, 4, 5, 6)
9. (1, 6, 9, 4, 1)
10. (1, 6, 5, 3, 1)
11. (1, 8, 5, 4, 1)
12. (1, 8, 9, 4, 1)
13. (3, 9, 8, 1, 3)
14. (3, 9, 4, 5, 3)
15. (3, 1, 6, 5, 3)
16. (3, 1, 8, 5, 3)
17. (8, 4, 9, 1, 8)
18. (8, 4, 7, 0, 8)
19. (8, 5, 4, 7, 8)
20. (8, 5, 1, 6, 8)
21. (5, 4, 9, 3, 5)
22. (5, 4, 7, 0, 5)
23. (5, 6, 1, 3, 5)
24. (5, 6, 9, 8, 5)
25. (0, 4, 7, 8, 0)
26. (0, 4, 9, 6, 0)
27. (0, 7, 4, 5, 0)
28. (0, 7, 8, 1, 0)
29. (2, 3, 9, 6, 2)
30. (2, 3, 1, 8, 2)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, (8, 9), 4>
2. <4, (5, 7), 8>
3. <3, (1, 6), 9>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles is [3].
