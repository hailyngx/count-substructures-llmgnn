Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

- Cycle 1: (5, 23, 3, 21, 22, 9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 28, 29, 19, 0, 14, 10, 23, 17, 5, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 28, 4, 18, 27, 2, 22, 9)
- Cycle 4: (20, 25, 26, 16, 7, 22, 21, 11, 25)
- Cycle 5: (15, 25, 20, 13, 29, 19, 17, 15)
- Cycle 6: (15, 17, 23, 10, 14, 0, 19, 29, 13, 15)
- Cycle 7: (21, 22, 2, 26, 16, 7, 27, 18, 4, 28, 9, 22, 21)
- Cycle 8: (11, 25, 20, 13, 29, 28, 9, 5, 23, 3, 21, 11)
- Cycle 9: (11, 26, 16, 7, 27, 18, 4, 28, 9, 22, 21, 3, 23, 10, 14, 0, 19, 29, 13, 15, 11)
- Cycle 10: (13, 29, 28, 9, 22, 21, 3, 23, 10, 14, 0, 19, 17, 5, 23, 17, 15, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. 

- <1, (5, 23), 3, 21, 22, 9> (Chord: (5, 23))
- <2, 9, 28, (29, 19), 0, 14, 10, 23, 17, 5> (Chord: (29, 19))
- <3, 9, 28, 4, 18, 27, (2, 22), 9> (Chord: (2, 22))
- <4, (20, 25), 26, 16, 7, 22, 21, 11, 25> (Chord: (20, 25))
- <5, 15, 25, 20, 13, 29, 19, 17, 15> (Chord: (15, 25))
- <6, 15, 17, 23, 10, 14, 0, (19, 29), 13, 15> (Chord: (19, 29))
- <7, 21, 22, 2, 26, 16, 7, 27, 18, 4, 28, 9> (Chord: (21, 22))
- <8, 11, 25, 20, 13, 29, 28, 9, 5, 23, 3, 21> (Chord: (29, 28))
- <9, 11, 26, 16, 7, 27, 18, 4, 28, 9, 22, 21, 3, 23, 10, 14, 0, 19, 29, 13, 15> (Chord: (29, 28))
- <10, 13, 29, 28, 9, 22, 21, 3, 23, 10, 14, 0, 19, 17, 5, 23, 17, 15> (Chord: (13, 29))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found. 
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [10].
