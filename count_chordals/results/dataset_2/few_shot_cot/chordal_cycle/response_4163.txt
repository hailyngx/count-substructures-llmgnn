Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 17, 4, 5>
- Cycle 2: <1, 20, 7, 8, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 26, 11, 24, 6>
- Cycle 4: <3, 27, 9, 4, 19>
- Cycle 5: <22, 20, 1, 25, 22>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 14, 17, 4, 5> has one chord (14, 4).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
As there is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
