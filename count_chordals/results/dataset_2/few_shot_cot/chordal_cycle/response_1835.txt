Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle <1, 17, 4, 28, 16, 2> with 5 edges
- Cycle <1, 17, 20, 25, 14, 24> with 5 edges
- Cycle <1, 13, 29, 5, 22> with 4 edges
- Cycle <1, 15, 19, 3, 11> with 4 edges
- Cycle <4, 0, 23, 11, 25> with 4 edges
- Cycle <4, 17, 20, 25, 11> with 4 edges
- Cycle <4, 28, 24, 22, 5> with 4 edges
- Cycle <16, 2, 18, 5, 22> with 4 edges
- Cycle <16, 27, 21, 10, 2> with 4 edges
- Cycle <16, 27, 21, 10, 2, 18, 5, 22> with 7 edges

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The cycle <1, 17, 4, 28, 16, 2> has chord <2, 4>
- The cycle <1, 13, 29, 5, 22> has chord <1, 5>
- The cycle <1, 15, 19, 3, 11> has chord <3, 1>
- The cycle <4, 28, 24, 22, 5> has chord <4, 22>
- The cycle <16, 2, 18, 5, 22> has chord <2, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
