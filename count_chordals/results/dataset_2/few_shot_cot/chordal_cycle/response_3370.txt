- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord <3, 0>
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord <1, 2>
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord <1, 3>
- Cycle 12 has exactly one chord <4, 8>
- Cycle 14 has exactly one chord <3, 2>
- Cycle 15 has exactly one chord <0, 7>
- Cycle 17 has exactly one chord <6, 4>
- Cycle 19 has exactly one chord <7, 5>
- Cycle 20 has exactly one chord <2, 6>
- Cycle 22 has exactly one chord <6, 7>
- Cycle 23 has exactly one chord <4, 9>
- Cycle 25 has exactly one chord <5, 7>
- Cycle 27 has exactly one chord <4, 6>
- Cycle 29 has exactly one chord <5, 9>
- Cycle 30 has exactly one chord <3, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.
There are 19 chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord, so the final count is [19].
