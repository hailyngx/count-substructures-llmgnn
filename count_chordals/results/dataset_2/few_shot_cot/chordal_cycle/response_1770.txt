Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle: <0, 7, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 7, 4, 8, 3, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 7, 4, 6, 1, 0>
- Cycle: <1, 4, 7, 0, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 4, 8, 2, 7, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 4, 8, 5, 7, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 4, 9, 7, 0, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 6, 4, 7, 0, 1>
- Cycle: <3, 7, 4, 1, 9, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 7, 9, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle: <4, 1, 6, 4>
- Cycle: <4, 1, 9, 4>
- Cycle: <4, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle: <4, 7, 0, 7>
- Cycle: <4, 7, 9, 4>
- Cycle: <4, 8, 2, 8>
- Cycle: <4, 8, 3, 8>
- Cycle: <5, 8, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle: <7, 0, 5, 8, 7>
- Cycle: <7, 2, 0, 1, 7>
  
Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle with chord <1, 2>: <1, 4, 8, 2, 7, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle with chord <0, 5>: <7, 0, 5, 8, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle with chord <0, 2>: <7, 2, 0, 1, 7>

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles = [18]
