Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<0, 3, 1, 5>
<0, 3, 7, 5>
<0, 4, 7, 5>
<2, 6, 7, 3>
<2, 6, 9, 8>
<2, 9, 8, 3>
<2, 9, 6, 7>
<3, 1, 2, 6>
<3, 1, 5, 7>
<3, 6, 7, 9>
<3, 6, 2, 1>
<3, 6, 9, 8>
<3, 6, 7, 4>
<3, 7, 9, 8>
<3, 7, 4, 5>
<4, 7, 3, 6>
<4, 7, 5, 1>
<4, 0, 3, 6>
<4, 0, 5, 1>
<5, 1, 2, 9>
<5, 1, 3, 6>
<5, 1, 4, 7>
<5, 7, 6, 3>
<5, 7, 3, 0>
<6, 2, 1, 5>

<6, 9, 8, 3>
<6, 9, 7, 4>
<7, 6, 3, 0>
<7, 6, 9, 8>
<8, 9, 6, 7>
<8, 9, 3, 1>
<8, 3, 7, 5>
<9, 6, 2, 1>
<9, 6, 3, 7>
<9, 8, 5, 1>

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
<2, 6, 7, 3, (9, 8)>
<3, 1, 2, 6, (9, 8)>
<3, 6, 7, 9, (8, 4)>
<5, 1, 4, 7, (3, 6)>
<6, 2, 1, 5, (9, 8)>
<6, 9, 8, 3, (2, 7)>
<8, 9, 6, 7, (3, 5)>
<9, 6, 3, 7, (1, 2)>

Step 3: Count the number of unique chordal 4-cycles:
