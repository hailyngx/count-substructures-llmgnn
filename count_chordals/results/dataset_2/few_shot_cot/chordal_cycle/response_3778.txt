Response:
There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles in the provided graph. Therefore, the final answer would be [13].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<11, 16, 13, 0>, with a chord (11, 13)
<11, 16, 12, 15>, with a chord (12, 16)
<11, 16, 15, 9>, with a chord (11, 15)
<11, 16, 1, 7>, with a chord (1, 16)
<11, 16, 12, 5>, with a chord (5, 12)
<5, 12, 13, 0>, with a chord (12, 13)
<5, 12, 15, 9>, with a chord (9, 15)
<5, 15, 9, 19>, with a chord (9, 15)
<5, 15, 16, 11>, with a chord (11, 15)
<5, 15, 12, 16>, with a chord (12, 15)
<5, 15, 16, 1>, with a chord (1, 16)
<5, 15, 9, 0>, with a chord (0, 9)
<5, 15, 12, 6>, with a chord (6, 12)
