Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 13) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 6) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 11) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 12) (2, 0) (2, 4) (11, 5) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 4) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 11) (4, 10) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 6) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 6)

Response:
The chordless 4-cycles are as follows: 

[5]

<9, 13, 11, 12>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
