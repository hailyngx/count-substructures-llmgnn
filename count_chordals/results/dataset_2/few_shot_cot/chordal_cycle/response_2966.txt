Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
1. <5, 9, 1, 7> (Chords: (1, 9))
2. <5, 9, 6, 1> (Chords: (1, 6))
3. <5, 4, 3, 1> (Chords: (3, 4))
4. <5, 3, 1, 7> (Chords: (1, 3))
5. <9, 5, 8, 7> (Chords: (5, 8))
6. <9, 1, 3, 8> (Chords: (1, 3))
7. <9, 1, 6, 8> (Chords: (1, 6))
8. <4, 5, 3, 1> (Chords: (3, 4))
9. <4, 3, 8, 5> (Chords: (3, 8))
10. <5, 8, 3, 1> (Chords: (3, 8))
11. <5, 0, 6, 8> (Chords: (6, 8))
12. <9, 5, 3, 8> (Chords: (5, 8))
13. <9, 7, 1, 3> (Chords: (1, 3))
14. <9, 7, 8, 5> (Chords: (5, 8))

Therefore, there are a total of [14] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
