Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 2, 10, 13>
2. <1, 6, 9, 4>
3. <2, 10, 7, 6>
4. <4, 9, 14, 10>
5. <5, 1, 6, 9>
6. <6, 4, 11, 3>
7. <7, 6, 1, 5>
8. <8, 11, 4, 9>
9. <10, 7, 11, 3>
10. <11, 4, 9, 14>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <1, 6, 9, 4, (7, 13)>
2. <2, 10, 7, 6, (11, 3)>
3. <4, 9, 14, 10, (11, 7)>
4. <5, 1, 6, 9, (8, 14)>
5. <6, 4, 11, 3, (7, 1)>
6. <7, 6, 1, 5, (10, 11)>
7. <8, 11, 4, 9, (2, 5)>
8. <10, 7, 11, 3, (13, 0)>
9. <11, 4, 9, 14, (10, 7)>

Step 3:
There are [9] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
