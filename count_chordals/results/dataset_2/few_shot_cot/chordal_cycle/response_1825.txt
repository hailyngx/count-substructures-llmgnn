Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles with a length of 4 or more are: 
- Cycle 1: 0-3-6-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-4-5-0
- Cycle 3: 1-7-6-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-7-6-9-1
- Cycle 5: 2-5-9-6-2
- Cycle 6: 2-6-7-1-2
- Cycle 7: 2-6-3-0-2
- Cycle 8: 3-6-7-1-3
- Cycle 9: 3-8-7-6-3
- Cycle 10: 4-5-9-6-4
- Cycle 11: 4-0-3-6-4
- Cycle 12: 4-0-8-3-4
- Cycle 13: 5-9-6-3-5
- Cycle 14: 5-2-6-3-5
- Cycle 15: 5-2-0-4-5
- Cycle 16: 6-7-1-9-6
- Cycle 17: 6-2-5-4-6
- Cycle 18: 7-1-9-5-7
- Cycle 19: 7-8-1-9-7
- Cycle 20: 8-1-7-6-8
- Cycle 21: 8-3-6-7-8
- Cycle 22: 8-4-5-9-8
- Cycle 23: 8-0-3-4-8
- Cycle 24: 0-2-5-4-0

Step 2:
Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3 <1, (6, 5), 7>
- Cycle 6 <2, (7, 1), 6>
- Cycle 11 <4, (3, 6), 0>
- Cycle 15 <5, (2, 6), 4>
- Cycle 19 <7, (1, 9), 8>

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]
