Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in this graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <2, 9, 5, 6>
- Cycle 2: <4, 18, 5, 6>
- Cycle 3: <7, 14, 19, 5>
- Cycle 4: <7, 17, 1, 3>
- Cycle 5: <7, 17, 10, 6>
- Cycle 6: <8, 0, 10, 17>
- Cycle 7: <8, 9, 5, 6>
- Cycle 8: <8, 9, 15, 7>
- Cycle 9: <0, 10, 17, 7>
- Cycle 10: <0, 12, 15, 7>
- Cycle 11: <10, 17, 1, 3>
- Cycle 12: <11, 16, 3, 9>
- Cycle 13: <4, 2, 9, 5>
  
Step 2:
Among these cycles, the only cycle with a single chord is Cycle 1: <2, 9, 5, 6>. 
Therefore, the chordal 4-cycle is <2, (5, 6), 9>.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [12].
