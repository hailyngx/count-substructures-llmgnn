Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (6, 7) (6, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1:  
- Cycle 1: <1, 5, 7, 4, 1>  
- Cycle 2: <3, 5, 7, 4, 3>  
- Cycle 3: <7, 4, 9, 7, 8>  
- Cycle 4: <4, 1, 8, 9, 4>  
- Cycle 5: <6, 7, 5, 2, 6>  

Step 2:  
- Unique chordal 4-cycle found:  
<1, 5, (7, 4), 1>  

Step 3:  
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, so the final number is [1].
