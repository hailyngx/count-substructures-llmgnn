Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 9, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 3, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 3, 7, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 2, 9, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 4, 2, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 9, 4, 6, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 1, 9, 4, 3>
- Cycle 8: <3, 7, 9, 4, 3>
- Cycle 9: <4, 6, 7, 9, 4>
- Cycle 10: <7, 3, 1, 9, 7>
- Cycle 11: <7, 3, 8, 5, 7>
- Cycle 12: <8, 9, 4, 6, 8>
- Cycle 13: <9, 8, 0, 1, 9>
- Cycle 14: <9, 8, 5, 7, 9>

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles are as follows:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <0, (1, 9), 8, 0>
- Chordal Cycle 2: <0, (3, 7), 9, 4>
- Chordal Cycle 3: <2, (3, 9), 4, 6>
- Chordal Cycle 4: <3, (1, 9), 4, 7>
- Chordal Cycle 5: <3, (7, 5), 8, 3>
- Chordal Cycle 6: <4, (6, 8), 9, 4>
- Chordal Cycle 7: <7, (3, 9), 4, 7>
- Chordal Cycle 8: <9, (1, 8), 5, 7>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [6].
