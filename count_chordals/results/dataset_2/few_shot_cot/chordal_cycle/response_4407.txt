Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 4, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 5, 3, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 5, 6, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 3, 9, 4, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 6, 8, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 7, 4, 9, 2>
- Cycle 7: <2, 0, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle 8: <3, 4, 9, 8, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 6, 5, 1, 3>
- Cycle 10: <4, 7, 0, 6, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 7, 2, 9, 4>
- Cycle 12: <5, 6, 4, 9, 5>
- Cycle 13: <5, 6, 0, 7, 5>
- Cycle 14: <6, 7, 2, 9, 6>
- Cycle 15: <7, 2, 9, 8, 7>
- Cycle 16: <9, 4, 7, 2, 9>
- Cycle 17: <9, 8, 1, 5, 9>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (6, 4)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (6, 5)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 12 has a chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 13 has a chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 14 has a chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 16 has a chord (7, 2)
- Cycle 17 has a chord (1, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 17 cycles in total and 10 cycles with exactly one chord. So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 7, 4, 6, 0>
- <0, 6, 5, 3, 0>
- <1, 3, 9, 4, 1>
- <2, 7, 4, 9, 2>
- <1, 5, 6, 8, 1>
- <3, 6, 5, 1, 3>
- <9, 8, 1, 5, 9>
