Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 5> with chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 6, 3> with chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 13, 8> with chord (4, 1)
- Cycle 4: <0, 13, 8, 11> with chord (2, 10)
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 9, 6> with chord (0, 13)
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 8, 13> with chord (0, 12)
- Cycle 7: <1, 10, 12, 1> with chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 8: <2, 7, 5, 6> with chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 9: <2, 7, 5, 4> with chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 10: <2, 8, 4, 5> with chord (1, 11)
- Cycle 11: <3, 9, 6, 5> with chord (0, 13)
- Cycle 12: <3, 9, 13, 8> with chord (0, 2)
- Cycle 13: <3, 10, 12, 1> with chord (4, 11)
- Cycle 14: <3, 11, 2, 7> with chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 15: <4, 1, 12, 10> with chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 16: <4, 5, 7, 2> with chord (0, 13)
- Cycle 17: <5, 6, 3, 9> with chord (0, 13)
- Cycle 18: <5, 7, 2, 1> with chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 19: <6, 5, 7, 2> with chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 20: <6, 9, 3, 11> with chord (4, 13)
- Cycle 21: <6, 13, 8, 11> with chord (0, 4)
- Cycle 22: <8, 4, 5, 7> with chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 23: <9, 6, 5, 7> with chord (0, 13)
- Cycle 24: <9, 13, 8, 4> with chord (0, 1)
- Cycle 25: <10, 11, 3, 9> with chord (6, 13)
- Cycle 26: <11, 3, 9, 6> with chord (4, 13)
- Cycle 27: <11, 14, 3, 9> with chord (4, 13)
- Cycle 28: <12, 10, 11, 3> with chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 29: <13, 8, 4, 5> with chord (0, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <0, 9, 6, 5> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (4, 8)
- <1, 4, 9, 6> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (0, 13)
- <2, 7, 5, 6> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (1, 2)
- <3, 9, 13, 8> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (0, 2)
- <4, 1, 12, 10> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (9, 6)
- <5, 6, 3, 9> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (0, 13)
- <6, 5, 7, 2> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (1, 8)
- <8, 4, 5, 7> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (1, 8)
- <9, 6, 5, 7> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (0, 13)
- <10, 11, 3, 9> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (6, 13)
- <13, 8, 4, 5> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (0, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 11 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the final count is [11].
