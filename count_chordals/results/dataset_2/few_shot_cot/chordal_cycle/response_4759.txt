Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 4, 8, 5>
- Cycle 2: <1, 8, 5, 4, 7>
- Cycle 3: <2, 4, 9, 3, 7>
- Cycle 4: <3, 7, 4, 9, 0>
- Cycle 5: <4, 5, 8, 1, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 4, 8, 5> has exactly one chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 2: <1, 8, 5, 4, 7> doesn't have exactly one chord
- Cycle 3: <2, 4, 9, 3, 7> doesn't have exactly one chord
- Cycle 4: <3, 7, 4, 9, 0> doesn't have exactly one chord
- Cycle 5: <4, 5, 8, 1, 6> doesn't have exactly one chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
