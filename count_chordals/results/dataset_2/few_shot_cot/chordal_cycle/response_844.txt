Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 7, 19, 11, 5>
2. <0, 13, 5, 11, 19>
3. <0, 13, 5, 11, 16>
4. <0, 13, 18, 1, 5>
5. <2, 9, 10, 5, 11>
6. <2, 9, 10, 3, 21>
7. <2, 9, 10, 22, 20>
8. <2, 9, 7, 0, 13>
9. <3, 21, 8, 17, 12>
10. <3, 21, 8, 2, 27>
11. <3, 21, 8, 17, 15>
12. <3, 21, 8, 2, 25>
13. <3, 6, 15, 17, 12>
14. <4, 27, 12, 19, 14>
15. <4, 27, 2, 8, 21>
16. <4, 27, 2, 9, 7>
17. <4, 20, 24, 29, 16>
18. <4, 20, 24, 29, 14>
19. <4, 20, 22, 10, 5>
20. <5, 11, 16, 15, 17>
21. <5, 11, 19, 14, 29>
22. <5, 11, 19, 12, 27>
23. <5, 1, 18, 13, 25>
24. <6, 3, 21, 8, 17>
25. <6, 15, 17, 12, 19>
26. <7, 19, 11, 16, 29>
27. <8, 21, 3, 6, 15>
28. <9, 2, 27, 12, 19>
29. <9, 10, 5, 1, 18>
30. <10, 5, 11, 16, 15>
31. <10, 5, 11, 19, 12>
32. <10, 22, 20, 24, 29>
33. <13, 5, 11, 16, 15>
34. <13, 5, 11, 19, 14>
35. <13, 18, 1, 27, 4>
36. <18, 26, 24, 20, 22>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, 13, 5, 11, 19>, with a chord between nodes 13 and 11

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The total number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [1].
