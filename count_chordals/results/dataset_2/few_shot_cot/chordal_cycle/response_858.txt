Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 6, 4, 2, 0>
2. <0, 6, 9, 1, 0>
3. <0, 6, 4, 8, 11, 0>
4. <0, 6, 3, 7, 5, 0>
5. <0, 6, 3, 13, 10, 12, 11, 0>
6. <0, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6, 3, 13, 10, 5, 0>
7. <0, 9, 1, 2, 4, 6, 3, 13, 10, 12, 11, 0>
8. <2, 4, 6, 3, 7, 5, 13, 2>
9. <2, 7, 5, 0, 6, 3, 13, 10, 12, 11, 8, 4, 2>
10. <2, 13, 3, 6, 0, 1, 9, 6, 12, 10, 13, 2>
11. <3, 6, 4, 2, 7, 5, 10, 13, 3>
12. <3, 7, 5, 0, 6, 9, 1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 12, 10, 13, 3>
13. <4, 6, 3, 7, 2, 11, 12, 10, 13, 5, 4>
14. <5, 0, 6, 4, 8, 11, 12, 10, 5>
15. <6, 3, 13, 2, 14, 6>
16. <6, 4, 2, 7, 12, 10, 5, 0, 11, 8, 4>
17. <6, 9, 1, 2, 7, 5, 13, 10, 12, 11, 0, 6>
18. <6, 9, 1, 0, 5, 7, 12, 11, 2, 4, 6>
19. <7, 12, 10, 13, 3, 6, 9, 1, 0, 5, 7>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <2, 4, 6, 3, 13, 10, 12, 11, 2>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [18].
