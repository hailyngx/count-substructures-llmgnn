Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle <3, 1, 5, 15>
- Cycle <1, 14, 11, 7>
- Cycle <2, 15, 8, 14>
- Cycle <7, 11, 2, 15>
- Cycle <9, 3, 1, 6>
- Cycle <10, 8, 15, 5>
- Cycle <12, 7, 17, 0>
- Cycle <16, 1, 14, 18>
- Cycle <19, 12, 7, 17>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle <3, 1, 5, 15> has chord (1, 15)
- Cycle <1, 14, 11, 7> has chord (1, 11)
- Cycle <2, 15, 8, 14> has chord (15, 14)
- Cycle <7, 11, 2, 15> has chord (11, 2)
- Cycle <9, 3, 1, 6> has chord (3, 1)
- Cycle <10, 8, 15, 5> has chord (8, 15)
- Cycle <12, 7, 17, 0> has chord (7, 17)
- Cycle <16, 1, 14, 18> has chord (1, 14)
- Cycle <19, 12, 7, 17> has chord (12, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless 4-cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final count is [0].
