Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <0, 14, 17, 13, 0>
2. <0, 14, 19, 28, 9, 20, 13, 17, 0>

5. <1, 21, 16, 7, 27, 15, 27, 8, 25, 0, 14, 17, 13, 24, 3, 11, 25, 12, 28, 19, 6, 22, 6, 19, 14, 0>

16. <9, 28, 19, 14, 17, 13, 20, 1, 21, 16, 29, 0>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 14, 19, 28, 9, 20, 13, 17, 0> has one chord (9, 19)
- <1, 21, 16, 7, 27, 15, 27, 8, 25, 0, 14, 17, 13, 24, 3, 11, 25, 12, 28, 19, 6, 22, 6, 19, 14, 0> has one chord (1, 6)
- <1, 21, 29, 0, 14, 17, 13, 20, 13, 17, 14, 0, 29, 1> has one chord (1, 0)
- <2, 1, 21, 16, 7, 27, 15, 27, 8, 25, 11, 23, 18, 14, 17, 13, 24, 3, 10, 26, 4, 1> has one chord (2, 16)
- <3, 24, 13, 20, 1, 21, 16, 29, 4, 26, 10, 3> has one chord (3, 4)
- <7, 16, 21, 1, 20, 13, 24, 3, 11, 25, 8, 27> has one chord (7, 8)
- <9, 28, 19, 14, 17, 13, 20, 1, 21, 16, 29, 0> has one chord (9, 16)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 7

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
