Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <5, (0, 6), 4>
- <9, (7, 2), 5>
- <6, (0, 13), 4>
- <5, (0, 8), 10>
- <3, (1, 8), 14>
- <5, (0, 10), 8>
- <5, (0, 8), 1>
- <5, (0, 10), 2>
- <6, (0, 5), 9>
- <8, (0, 10), 12>
- <12, (3, 1), 8>
- <14, (5, 11), 2>
- <11, (2, 7), 5>
- <14, (12, 8), 5>
- <14, (3, 13), 6>

Step 3:
Since we found 15 unique chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [15].
