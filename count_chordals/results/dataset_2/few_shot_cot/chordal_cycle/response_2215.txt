Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 2, 12, 4, 8, 0, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 15, 16, 9, 14, 11, 1, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 15, 16, 18, 13, 11, 1, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 14, 11, 1, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 14, 11, 13, 18, 3, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 9, 14, 11, 13, 4, 8, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 9, 16, 18, 13, 11, 1, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 9, 16, 18, 13, 4, 8, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 9, 16, 18, 3, 19, 10, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 9, 16, 18, 3, 19, 0, 5)
- Cycle 11: (5, 9, 16, 15, 2, 12, 4, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 9, 16, 15, 2, 12, 4, 8, 0, 5)
- Cycle 13: (5, 9, 16, 15, 2, 12, 4, 17, 8, 0, 6, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 15, 16, 9>: Chord = (5, 9)
- <5, 9, 16, 15>: Chord = (5, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]
