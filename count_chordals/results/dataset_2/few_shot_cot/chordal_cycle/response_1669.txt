Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 1, 4, 8, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 3, 6, 1, 4, 8, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 6, 3, 5, 2, 8, 4, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 5, 4, 8, 2>
- Cycle 6: <3, 5, 4, 6, 1, 9, 3>
- Cycle 7: <4, 6, 1, 9, 3, 5, 4>
- Cycle 8: <5, 2, 8, 4, 6, 3, 9, 5>
- Cycle 9: <6, 3, 5, 2, 8, 4, 6>
- Cycle 10: <7, 9, 0, 7>
- Cycle 11: <8, 5, 4, 6, 3, 9, 0, 8>
- Cycle 12: <9, 6, 1, 4, 8, 5, 2, 0, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 6, 1, (4), 8, 5, 2, 0> Chord: (4)
- <1, (9), 6, 3, 5, 2, 8, 4, 1> Chord: (9)
- <2, 5, 4, 8, (2)> Chord: (2)
- <3, 5, 4, 6, 1, (9), 3> Chord: (9)
- <4, 6, 1, (9), 3, 5, 4> Chord: (9)
- <5, 2, 8, 4, 6, 3, (9), 5> Chord: (9)
- <6, 3, 5, 2, 8, 4, (6)> Chord: (6)
- <8, 5, 4, 6, 3, (9), 0, 8> Chord: (9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, 9, 6, 1, 4, 8, 5, 2, 0>
