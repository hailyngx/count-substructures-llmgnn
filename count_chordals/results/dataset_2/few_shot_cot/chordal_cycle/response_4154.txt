Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 11, 10, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 11, 10, 14, 13, 4, 3, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 11, 10, 14, 13, 6, 7, 8, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 11, 10, 12, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 11, 10, 12, 3, 14, 13, 4, 12, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 11, 10, 12, 4, 13, 6, 7, 8, 0>
- Cycle 8: <0, 11, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 12, 0>
- Cycle 9: <0, 11, 10, 2, 5, 12, 4, 13, 3, 0>
- Cycle 10: <0, 11, 10, 2, 13, 4, 12, 3, 0>
- Cycle 11: <0, 11, 10, 2, 13, 6, 7, 8, 0>
- Cycle 12: <0, 11, 1, 0>
- ... (and so on)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 11, 10, 2, 0> with the chord (2, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 11, 10, 14, 13, 6, 7, 8, 0> with the chord (7, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 11, 10, 12, 4, 13, 6, 7, 8, 0> with the chord (4, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 11, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 12, 0> with the chord (9, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, 11, 10, 2, 5, 12, 4, 13, 3, 0> with the chord (4, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <0, 11, 10, 2, 13, 4, 12, 3, 0> with the chord (4, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <0, 11, 10, 2, 13, 6, 7, 8, 0> with the chord (7, 6)
- ... (and so on)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are [5] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
