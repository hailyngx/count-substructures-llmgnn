Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph, but not all of them are chordal 4-cycles. We will list them all first.
Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-7-3-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-3-7-5
- Cycle 3: 5-4-8-0-5
- Cycle 4: 5-8-0-6-5
- Cycle 5: 5-1-0-8-5
- Cycle 6: 9-5-4-8-9
- Cycle 7: 9-3-7-0-9
- Cycle 8: 4-5-3-8-4
- Cycle 9: 7-9-5-3-7
- Cycle 10: 6-7-0-8-6
- Cycle 11: 8-0-1-5-8
- Cycle 12: 0-7-6-2-0
- Cycle 13: 3-7-9-5-3
- Cycle 14: 2-5-8-0-2
- Cycle 15: 1-5-9-2-1

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-7-3-5 has chord <9, 7>
- Cycle 2: 5-9-3-7-5 has chord <9, 3>
- Cycle 3: 5-4-8-0-5 has chord <4, 8>
- Cycle 4: 5-8-0-6-5 has chord <8, 6>
- Cycle 5: 5-1-0-8-5 has chord <1, 8>
- Cycle 6: 9-5-4-8-9 has no chord
- Cycle 7: 9-3-7-0-9 has no chord
- Cycle 8: 4-5-3-8-4 has no chord
- Cycle 9: 7-9-5-3-7 has no chord
- Cycle 10: 6-7-0-8-6 has no chord
- Cycle 11: 8-0-1-5-8 has no chord
- Cycle 12: 0-7-6-2-0 has no chord
- Cycle 13: 3-7-9-5-3 has no chord
- Cycle 14: 2-5-8-0-2 has no chord
- Cycle 15: 1-5-9-2-1 has no chord

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the answer is [5].
