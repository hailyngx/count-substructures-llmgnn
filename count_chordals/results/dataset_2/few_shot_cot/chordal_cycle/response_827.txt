Response:
Step 1: 
- 4-cycle with edges (1, 6), (6, 9), (9, 13), (13, 1)
- 4-cycle with edges (1, 6), (6, 4), (4, 7), (7, 1)
- 4-cycle with edges (1, 6), (6, 7), (7, 14), (14, 1)
- 4-cycle with edges (1, 9), (9, 8), (8, 13), (13, 1)
- 4-cycle with edges (1, 9), (9, 3), (3, 5), (5, 1)
- 4-cycle with edges (1, 10), (10, 2), (2, 0), (0, 1)
- 4-cycle with edges (3, 9), (9, 13), (13, 11), (11, 3)
- 4-cycle with edges (3, 5), (5, 0), (0, 2), (2, 3)
- 4-cycle with edges (4, 6), (6, 7), (7, 14), (14, 4)

Step 2:
- The 4-cycle with edges (1, 6), (6, 4), (4, 7), (7, 1) has a chord (4, 1).
- The 4-cycle with edges (1, 10), (10, 2), (2, 0), (0, 1) has a chord (0, 10).
- The 4-cycle with edges (4, 6), (6, 7), (7, 14), (14, 4) has a chord (6, 14).

Step 3:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord, so the answer is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, 6, 4, 7, (4, 1)>
- <1, 10, 2, 0, (0, 10)>
- <4, 6, 7, 14, (6, 14)>
