Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 9 - 1 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 9 - 3 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 7 - 5 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 4: 1 - 9 - 8 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 4 - 7 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 6: 2 - 5 - 8 - 2
- Cycle 7: 2 - 8 - 9 - 3 - 2
- Cycle 8: 3 - 9 - 8 - 2 - 3
- Cycle 9: 4 - 7 - 0 - 3 - 4
- Cycle 10: 5 - 7 - 4 - 6 - 5

Step 2:
Checking for each cycle:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 9 - 1 - 4 - 0 has exactly one chord <1, 7>
- Cycle 2: 0 - 9 - 3 - 7 - 0 has exactly one chord <3, 9>
- Cycle 3: 0 - 7 - 5 - 8 - 0 has exactly one chord <5, 8>
- Cycle 4: 1 - 9 - 8 - 5 - 1 has exactly one chord <8, 5>
- Cycle 5: 1 - 4 - 7 - 5 - 1 has exactly one chord <4, 7>
- Cycle 6: 2 - 5 - 8 - 2 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 7: 2 - 8 - 9 - 3 - 2 has exactly one chord <9, 3>
- Cycle 8: 3 - 9 - 8 - 2 - 3 has exactly one chord <8, 9>
- Cycle 9: 4 - 7 - 0 - 3 - 4 has exactly one chord <0, 7>
- Cycle 10: 5 - 7 - 4 - 6 - 5 does not have exactly one chord

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, (1, 7), 9, 4, 0>
<0, (3, 9), 7, 9, 0>
<0, (5, 8), 7, 5, 0>
<1, (8, 5), 9, 8, 1>
<1, (4, 7), 5, 7, 1>
