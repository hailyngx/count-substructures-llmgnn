Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 18, 11, 3, 10, 19, 16, 13, 0, 15, 17, 2)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 19, 16, 13, 0, 7, 8, 14, 12, 5)
- Cycle 4: (2, 18, 8, 14, 12, 10, 3, 11, 18, 2)
- Cycle 5: (1, 5, 19, 10, 3, 11, 14, 12, 5)
- Cycle 6: (2, 18, 11, 14, 8, 13, 16, 19, 7, 6, 2)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, 5, 4, 9> has chords (1, 9)
- <2, 18, 11, 3, 10, 19, 16, 13, 0, 15, 17> has no chords
- <1, 5, 19, 16, 13, 0, 7, 8, 14, 12> has chords (0, 8)
- <2, 18, 8, 14, 12, 10, 3, 11, 18> has chords (8, 18)
- <1, 5, 19, 10, 3, 11, 14, 12> has chords (3, 14)
- <2, 18, 11, 14, 8, 13, 16, 19, 7, 6> has chords (14, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- [1]
