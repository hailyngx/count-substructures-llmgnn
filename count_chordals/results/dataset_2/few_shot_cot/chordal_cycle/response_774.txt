Response:
Step 1: 

There are multiple cycles in the graph, but we are only looking for cycles of length 4 or more with all edges existing. After finding these cycles, we will check for the presence of exactly one chord in each.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 11, 3, 15, 24, 0>
2. <0, 11, 27, 17, 14, 2, 9, 23, 8, 1, 0>
3. <0, 11, 27, 17, 14, 25, 18, 20, 21, 15, 24, 0>
4. <0, 24, 12, 26, 5, 21, 15, 3, 11, 0>
5. <1, 8, 16, 15, 3, 11, 27, 17, 14, 25, 2, 9, 23, 1>
6. <2, 14, 17, 27, 11, 3, 15, 21, 20, 18, 25, 2>
7. <4, 20, 18, 25, 14, 2, 9, 29, 6, 7, 21, 15, 16, 8, 23, 19, 28, 29, 26, 12, 24, 10, 22, 14, 17, 27, 11, 0>
8. <5, 21, 20, 18, 0, 11, 3, 15, 16, 8, 23, 19, 28, 29, 26, 12, 24, 10, 22, 2, 14, 25, 18, 4>
9. <6, 7, 21, 15, 16, 8, 23, 9, 29, 26, 5, 4, 24, 12, 26, 29, 28, 19, 8>
10. <10, 7, 21, 15, 16, 8, 23, 9, 29, 28, 19, 0, 24, 12, 26, 5, 4, 20, 18, 25, 14, 17, 27, 11, 3, 15, 24, 10>
11. <13, 0, 11, 3, 15, 21, 5, 26, 12, 24, 10, 22, 14, 17, 27, 11>
12. <15, 3, 11, 27, 17, 14, 2, 9, 29, 26, 5, 21, 20, 4, 24, 12, 26, 29, 28, 19, 8, 16>

Step 2:

After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find that the unique chordal 4-cycle is:
- <0, 11, 27, 17, 14, 25, 2, 9, 23, 8, 1, 0>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
