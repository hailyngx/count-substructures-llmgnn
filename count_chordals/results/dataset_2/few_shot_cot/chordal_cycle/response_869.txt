Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2)

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-7-2-1-4-3-9-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-6-8-2-1-4-3-9-7-0
- Cycle 3: 1-9-8-2-4-3-7-5-0-6-1
- Cycle 4: 3-5-0-6-1-4-2-7-3
- Cycle 5: 4-1-6-8-2-7-5-0-3-9-4
- Cycle 6: 5-0-6-1-9-3-7-2-4-5
- Cycle 7: 6-0-5-4-2-8-9-1-6
- Cycle 8: 7-5-3-4-2-8-9-6-1-7

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 2 has chord (0, 9)
- Cycle 3 has chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 4 has chord (0, 6)
- Cycle 5 has chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 6 has chord (0, 2)
- Cycle 7 has chord (0, 5)
- Cycle 8 has chord (1, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are a total of [0] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<1, 3, 7, 9>
