Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 7, 0> (Chord: (0, 4))
- <0, 4, 11, 0> (Chord: (0, 4))
- <0, 4, 3, 2> (Chord: (2, 3))
- <0, 4, 3, 8> (Chord: (4, 3))
- <0, 4, 7, 12> (Chord: (12, 7))
- <0, 4, 7, 10> (Chord: (10, 7))
- <0, 7, 4, 11> (Chord: (11, 4))
- <0, 7, 4, 3> (Chord: (3, 4))
- <0, 7, 12, 13> (Chord: (13, 12))
- <0, 7, 12, 7> (Chord: (7, 12))
- <0, 11, 4, 3> (Chord: (4, 0))
- <0, 11, 4, 7> (Chord: (0, 7))
- <0, 11, 14, 2> (Chord: (14, 11))
- <0, 11, 14, 6> (Chord: (6, 14))
- <0, 11, 14, 5> (Chord: (5, 14))
- <0, 14, 2, 8> (Chord: (8, 2))
- <0, 14, 6, 1> (Chord: (1, 6))
- <4, 0, 7, 10> (Chord: (7, 4))
- <4, 7, 0, 11> (Chord: (4, 0))
- <7, 0, 4, 11> (Chord: (0, 7))
- <7, 4, 0, 3> (Chord: (4, 7))
- <7, 4, 3, 2> (Chord: (3, 4))
- <7, 4, 10, 9> (Chord: (9, 10))
- <7, 10, 1, 6> (Chord: (1, 10))
- <7, 12, 13, 11> (Chord: (11, 13))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
We found 7 chordal 4-cycles (with exactly one chord), so the final count is [7].
