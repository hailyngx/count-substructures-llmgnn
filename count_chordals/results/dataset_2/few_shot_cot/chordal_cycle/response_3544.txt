Response:
There are three chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. Here is the process of finding and listing them:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. Here are the cycles:

1. <0, 10, 4, 1>
2. <1, 4, 8, 5>
3. <2, 6, 9, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. 
The chordal 4-cycle is the one that has exactly one chord. 
Checking the cycles:
1. <0, 10, 4, 1> - This cycle does not have a chord.
2. <1, 4, 8, 5> - This cycle does not have a chord.
3. <2, 6, 9, 11> - This cycle has a chord (6, 11).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
As the only cycle with a chord is <2, 6, 9, 11>, the count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

List of unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<2, (6, 11), 9>
