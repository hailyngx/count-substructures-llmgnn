Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 9, 6, 4, 1>
- <0, 9, 6, 7, 1>
- <1, 3, 6, 9, 4>
- <1, 3, 6, 7, 1>
- <1, 7, 6, 9, 4>
- <2, 4, 9, 6, 3>
- <3, 1, 0, 9, 6>
- <3, 1, 7, 6, 9>
- <3, 6, 9, 4, 1>
- <4, 9, 6, 3, 1>
- <5, 3, 6, 9, 4>
- <5, 8, 1, 3, 6>
- <6, 9, 4, 1, 3>
- <7, 6, 9, 4, 1>
- <8, 5, 3, 6, 9>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (3, 6), 4, 9>
- <1, 7, (6, 9), 4>
- <2, (4, 9), 6, 3>
- <3, (1, 6), 4, 9>
- <5, (1, 3), 6, 9>
- <5, (3, 6), 9, 4>
- <7, (6, 9), 4, 1>
- <8, (3, 6), 9, 5>

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
