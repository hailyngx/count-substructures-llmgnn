Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 11, 17, 6, 1>
- <0, 5, 14, 16, 13>
- <0, 19, 17, 11, 0>
- <1, 4, 10, 8, 12>
- <1, 12, 13, 16, 14>
- <2, 18, 3, 1, 6>
- <2, 14, 16, 13, 12>
- <3, 9, 7, 15, 10>
- <4, 1, 12, 13, 16>
- <5, 0, 8, 12, 13>
- <6, 1, 4, 5, 0>
- <9, 7, 15, 10, 4>
- <11, 0, 5, 14, 16>
- <17, 11, 0, 8, 10>
- <18, 3, 1, 6, 17>
- <19, 17, 11, 0, 5>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 4, 10, 8, 12> has a chord (8, 10)
- <1, 12, 13, 16, 14> has a chord (12, 13)
- <3, 9, 7, 15, 10> has a chord (9, 10)
- <4, 1, 12, 13, 16> has a chord (1, 13)
- <5, 0, 8, 12, 13> has a chord (0, 8)
- <6, 1, 4, 5, 0> has a chord (1, 5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles found: [11]
