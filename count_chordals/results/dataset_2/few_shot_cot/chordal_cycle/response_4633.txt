Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

There are multiple cycles in the graph, but only one chordal 4-cycle, which is a 4-cycle with exactly one chord. 

The chordal 4-cycle is: <0, 5, 11, 7> 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

For the chordal 4-cycle <0, 5, 11, 7>, the chord is the edge connecting vertices 5 and 7.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

As there is only one chordal 4-cycle in the graph, the count of chordless cycles is [0].
