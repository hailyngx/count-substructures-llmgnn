Step 2:
Next, we will identify cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge):

- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (27, 5), 23>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (27, 17), 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (27, 17), 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (27, 5), 23>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <2,(29, 3), 26>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <3,(26, 17), 27>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <3,(26, 17), 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <4,(29, 23), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <9,(18, 19), 26>

- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <14,(6, 0), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <25,(21, 17), 4>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles, we find that there are [90] chordless 4-cycles in the graph.
