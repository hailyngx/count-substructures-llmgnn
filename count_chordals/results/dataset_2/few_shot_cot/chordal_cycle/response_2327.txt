Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle <0, 4, 5, 6>
        - Cycle <0, 1, 4, 5>
        - Cycle <0, 1, 3, 4>
        - Cycle <0, 1, 8, 9>
        - Cycle <1, 3, 4, 9>
        - Cycle <1, 4, 5, 9>
        - Cycle <2, 0, 6, 5>
        - Cycle <4, 5, 6, 9>
        - Cycle <5, 6, 9, 1>
        - Cycle <8, 9, 1, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - The cycle <0, 1, 4, 5> has a chord (1, 5) as the edge connecting non-adjacent nodes 1 and 5.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        As there is only 1 cycle with exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
        - <0, 1, 4, 5>
