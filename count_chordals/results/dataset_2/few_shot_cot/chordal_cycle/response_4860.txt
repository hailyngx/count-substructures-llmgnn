Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle 0-5-1-13-0
2. Cycle 5-4-11-14-5
3. Cycle 9-6-13-10-9
4. Cycle 10-12-7-8-10
5. Cycle 6-13-1-7-6
6. Cycle 2-8-11-4-2

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle 0-5-1-13-0 has a chord 5-13
- The cycle 5-4-11-14-5 has a chord 4-14
- The cycle 9-6-13-10-9 has a chord 6-10

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:

There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<0, 5-13, 1, 13-0>
<5, 4-14, 11, 14-5>
<9, 6-10, 13, 10-9>
