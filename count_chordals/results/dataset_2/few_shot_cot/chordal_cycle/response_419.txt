Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 4, 6, 2, 8, 7>
2. <0, 4, 6, 7, 2, 8>
3. <0, 4, 12, 5, 3, 1>
4. <0, 1, 10, 13, 2, 8>
5. <0, 1, 10, 13, 6, 4>
6. <0, 3, 1, 10, 13, 6>
7. <0, 3, 5, 12, 9, 1>
8. <0, 4, 14, 5, 12, 9>
9. <0, 4, 12, 9, 3, 5>
10. <2, 7, 8, 11, 13, 10>
11. <2, 13, 6, 4, 12, 5>
12. <4, 12, 9, 3, 11, 13>
13. <5, 14, 4, 7, 2, 8>
14. <5, 12, 9, 3, 11, 13>
15. <6, 4, 7, 2, 8, 11>
16. <6, 12, 2, 7, 4, 0>
17. <7, 2, 8, 11, 13, 6>
18. <8, 7, 4, 0, 1, 3>
19. <8, 7, 2, 13, 6, 12>
20. <10, 1, 3, 11, 13, 6>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <0, 4, 12, 5> (2, 9)
2. <0, 1, 10, 13> (3, 6)
3. <2, 7, 8, 11> (13, 6)

Step 3:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the count is [3].
