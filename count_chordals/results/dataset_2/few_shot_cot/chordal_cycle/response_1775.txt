Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 2, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 7, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 0, 6, 2, 8, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 8, 4, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 8, 3, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 9, 5, 4, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 9, 2, 6, 5, 4, 1>
- Cycle 11: <1, 9, 3, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 12: <2, 9, 5, 6, 2>
- Cycle 13: <2, 9, 3, 7, 4, 8, 2>
- Cycle 14: <3, 9, 5, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 15: <3, 9, 1, 7, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 16: <4, 5, 9, 3, 8, 4>
- Cycle 17: <4, 5, 9, 1, 7, 3, 4>
- Cycle 18: <5, 9, 1, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 19: <6, 5, 9, 2, 6>
- Cycle 20: <7, 1, 9, 3, 8, 7>
- Cycle 21: <7, 1, 9, 5, 4, 8, 7>
- Cycle 22: <9, 5, 6, 2, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 4, 8, 1> has a chord (4, 8)
- <1, 7, 4, 1> has a chord (7, 4)
- <1, 7, 0, 6, 2, 8, 1> has a chord (0, 2)
- <1, 9, 5, 4, 1> has a chord (5, 9)
- <2, 9, 3, 7, 4, 8, 2> has a chord (3, 4)
- <3, 9, 1, 7, 4, 8, 3> has a chord (1, 8)
- <4, 5, 9, 3, 8, 4> has a chord (5, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [15]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, (6, 2), 8>, <1, (4, 7), 1>, <1, (3, 1), 7>, <1, (8, 1), 4>, <2, (9, 7), 3>, <3, (9, 4), 8>, <3, (1, 7), 9>, <4, (5, 9), 1>, <5, (9, 6), 2>, <6, (9, 5), 2>
