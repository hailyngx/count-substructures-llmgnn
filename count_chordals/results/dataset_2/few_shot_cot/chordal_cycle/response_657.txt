Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 5, 9, 4, 2)
- Cycle 4: (8, 6, 5, 9, 8)
- Cycle 5: (0, 9, 4, 8, 0)
- Cycle 6: (2, 7, 0, 1, 2)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (one non-adjacent edge) are:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 0)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (5, 2)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (9, 4)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (0, 1)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <5, 3, 1, 6>
- <5, 2, 4, 9>
- <6, 5, 9, 8>
- <9, 4, 8, 0>
