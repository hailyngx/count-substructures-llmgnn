Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 8, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 7, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 11, 13, 11, 12, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 11, 12, 6, 5, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 12, 2, 7, 0, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 12, 6, 14, 2>
- Cycle 7: <4, 8, 7, 2, 3, 0, 4>
- Cycle 8: <4, 8, 14, 2, 1, 4>
- Cycle 9: <5, 8, 14, 6, 5>
- Cycle 10: <6, 5, 11, 13, 11, 12, 6>
- Cycle 11: <7, 2, 12, 6, 14, 4, 7>
- Cycle 12: <7, 8, 14, 2, 3, 0, 7>
- Cycle 13: <8, 5, 11, 13, 11, 12, 8>
- Cycle 14: <9, 11, 13, 11, 5, 6, 14, 9>
- Cycle 15: <10, 9, 11, 5, 0, 1, 4, 12, 2, 10>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 forms a chordal 4-cycle <0, (1, 4), 8, (7, 2), 0>
- Cycle 6 forms a chordal 4-cycle <2, (12, 6), 14, (3, 7), 2>
- Cycle 11 forms a chordal 4-cycle <7, (4, 8), 14, (2, 3), 7>
- Cycle 15 forms a chordal 4-cycle <10, (0, 1), 4, (12, 2), 10>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
