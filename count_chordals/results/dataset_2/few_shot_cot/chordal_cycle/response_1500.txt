Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

Cycles of length 4:
- (11, 16, 14, 1, 11)
- (11, 16, 10, 7, 11)
- (11, 16, 14, 13, 15, 11)
- (11, 16, 14, 13, 9, 11)
- (16, 14, 13, 9, 15, 16)
- (16, 10, 7, 1, 14, 16)
- (3, 15, 13, 14, 1, 3)
- (3, 15, 9, 11, 16, 3)
- (3, 1, 14, 13, 15, 3)
- (15, 13, 14, 1, 3, 15)
- (15, 9, 11, 16, 14, 15)
- (1, 14, 13, 15, 3, 1)
- (8, 11, 16, 14, 13, 9, 8)
- (8, 19, 17, 18, 4, 10, 7, 5, 15, 9, 13, 14, 1, 7)
- (13, 14, 1, 7, 10, 4, 18, 17, 19, 9, 11, 16, 14, 13)
- (10, 4, 18, 17, 19, 9, 11, 16, 14, 1, 7, 5, 15, 13, 10)
- (5, 15, 13, 14, 1, 7, 10, 4, 18, 17, 19, 9, 11, 16, 5)
- (4, 10, 7, 1, 14, 13, 15, 9, 11, 16, 4)
- (18, 17, 19, 9, 11, 16, 14, 13, 15, 5, 7, 0, 4, 18)
- (0, 5, 15, 13, 14, 1, 7, 10, 4, 18, 17, 19, 9, 0)
- (7, 1, 14, 13, 15, 5, 0, 4, 10, 16, 11, 9, 19, 7)

Next, let's identify the chordal 4-cycles:
- <11, (16, 14), 1, 11>
- <16, (14, 13), 9, 11>
- <3, (15, 13), 14, 1>
- <8, (11, 16), 14, 13>
- <8, (19, 17), 18, 4>
- <10, (4, 18), 17, 19>
- <5, (15, 13), 14, 1>
- <0, (5, 15), 13, 14>
- <7, (1, 14), 13, 15>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [18].
