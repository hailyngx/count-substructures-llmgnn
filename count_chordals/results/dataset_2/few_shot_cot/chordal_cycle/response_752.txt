42. <19, 20, 23, 8>
43. <21, 13, 6, 15>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, 17, 6, 11> has one chord: (1, 11)
- <5, 19, 11, 6> has one chord: (19, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:

There are 41 cycles listed above, and 2 of them have exactly one chord. So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [39].
