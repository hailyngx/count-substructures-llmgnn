Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 3, 0, 8, 4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 7, 10, 13, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 7, 10, 12, 2, 6)
- Cycle 4: (9, 6, 13, 4, 8, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 13, 10, 12, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 6, 13, 10, 7, 6, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 6, 2, 8, 4, 13, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 6, 2, 12, 10, 13, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 6, 2, 5, 4, 13, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 11, 3, 0, 8, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 11, 3, 14, 0, 8, 9)
- Cycle 12: (4, 8, 2, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 8, 2, 12, 10, 13, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 8, 2, 5, 0, 3, 14, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 14, 0, 3, 11, 6, 13, 4)
- Cycle 16: (4, 14, 3, 11, 6, 13, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (9, 13), 4, 8, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordless cycles: [16]
