Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with all edges existing in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 4, 9, 1) with edges (1, 5), (5, 4), (4, 9), (9, 1), (1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 4, 1, 0) with edges (0, 5), (5, 4), (4, 1), (1, 0), (0, 5)
- Cycle 3: (2, 8, 5, 1, 2) with edges (2, 8), (8, 5), (5, 1), (1, 2), (2, 8)
- Cycle 4: (3, 5, 4, 3) with edges (3, 5), (5, 4), (4, 3), (3, 5)
- Cycle 5: (6, 4, 5, 3, 6) with edges (6, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3), (3, 6), (6, 4)
- Cycle 6: (7, 9, 4, 7) with edges (7, 9), (9, 4), (4, 7), (7, 9)
- Cycle 7: (8, 5, 4, 8) with edges (8, 5), (5, 4), (4, 8), (8, 5)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <Cycle 1, (5, 9)> has one chord (5, 9)
- <Cycle 2, (5, 1)> has one chord (5, 1)
- <Cycle 3, (8, 1)> has one chord (8, 1)
- <Cycle 4, (5, 4)> has one chord (5, 4)
- <Cycle 5, (4, 5)> has one chord (4, 5)
- <Cycle 6, (9, 4)> has one chord (9, 4)
- <Cycle 7, (5, 8)> has one chord (5, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0. Therefore, the answer is [0].
