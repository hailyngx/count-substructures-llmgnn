Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 16, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 18, 7, 16, 1, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 18, 2, 14, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 10, 6, 11, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 5, 10, 6, 14, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 11, 6, 14, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle 7: <1, 16, 7, 18, 2, 14, 4, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 16, 7, 18, 14, 4, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 4, 14, 6, 10, 5, 0, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 4, 14, 6, 10, 5, 0>
- Cycle 11: <2, 18, 7, 16, 1, 4, 14, 2>
- Cycle 12: <4, 15, 11, 6, 10, 5, 0, 4>
- Cycle 13: <4, 15, 12, 13, 4>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 5, 10, 6, 11, 0> (chord: 6-11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 11, 6, 14, 4, 1, 0> (chord: 6-14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 18, 7, 16, 1, 0> (chord: 7-16)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 16, 7, 18, 2, 14, 4, 1> (chord: 7-18)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, 15, 11, 6, 10, 5, 0, 4> (chord: 5-10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are a total of [8] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
