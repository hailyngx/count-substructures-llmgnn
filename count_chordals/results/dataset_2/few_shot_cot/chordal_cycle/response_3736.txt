Response:
The total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].

Explanation:
There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
This can be verified by listing all cycles of length 4 or more (with all edges existing) and then checking for the presence of exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle). However, in this graph, there are no such cycles that meet the criteria of being a chordal 4-cycle.
