Response:
Step 1: 
- From the given graph, we can identify the following cycles of length 4: <5, (16, 7), 15, 10)> and <10, (4, 14), 6, 15)>
- We can also identify the following cycles of length greater than 4: <3, 16, 11, 4, 14, 6, 10, 15, 19> and <0, 8, 7, 11, 16, 5, 15, 10, 4>

Step 2: 
- Checking for exactly one chord in the identified cycles:
    - <5, (16, 7), 15, 10)> has one chord (16, 7) => <5, (16, 7), 15, 10)>
    - <10, (4, 14), 6, 15)> has one chord (4, 14) => <10, (4, 14), 6, 15)>

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are <5, (16, 7), 15, 10)> and <10, (4, 14), 6, 15)>, and the total count is [2].
