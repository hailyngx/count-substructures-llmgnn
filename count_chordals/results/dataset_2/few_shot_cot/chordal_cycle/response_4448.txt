Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle <0, 5, 1, 3>
2. Cycle <0, 1, 7, 9>
3. Cycle <1, 5, 4, 9>
4. Cycle <2, 4, 5, 9>
5. Cycle <2, 4, 7, 6>
6. Cycle <3, 1, 5, 9>
7. Cycle <4, 5, 9, 8>
8. Cycle <4, 7, 6, 2>
9. Cycle <6, 7, 9, 5>
10. Cycle <6, 8, 9, 4>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 5, 1, 3> has chord (1, 5)
- Cycle <0, 1, 7, 9> has chord (1, 7)
- Cycle <1, 5, 4, 9> has chord (5, 9)
- Cycle <2, 4, 5, 9> has chord (4, 9)
- Cycle <2, 4, 7, 6> has chord (4, 7)
- Cycle <3, 1, 5, 9> has chord (1, 9)
- Cycle <4, 5, 9, 8> has chord (5, 9)
- Cycle <4, 7, 6, 2> has chord (7, 6)
- Cycle <6, 7, 9, 5> has chord (7, 9)
- Cycle <6, 8, 9, 4> has chord (8, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0] since all cycles have at least one chord.
