Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 11, 6, 5>, <0, 11, 3, 5>, <0, 11, 3, 6>, <0, 11, 6, 14>, <0, 11, 6, 3>, <0, 11, 8, 3>, <0, 11, 8, 12>, <0, 11, 3, 10>, <0, 11, 6, 14>, <0, 11, 6, 5>, <0, 11, 3, 6>, <0, 11, 3, 5>, <0, 11, 8, 12>, <0, 11, 8, 3>, <0, 11, 3, 10>, <0, 11, 6, 14>, <0, 11, 6, 3>, <0, 11, 6, 5>, <0, 11, 7, 9>, <0, 11, 7, 0>, <0, 11, 6, 14>, <0, 11, 5, 6>, <0, 11, 5, 4>, <0, 11, 5, 3>, <0, 11, 6, 14>, <0, 11, 8, 12>, <0, 11, 8, 3>, <0, 11, 5, 6>, <0, 11, 5, 4>, <0, 11, 5, 3>, <0, 11, 6, 14>, <0, 11, 6, 3>, <0, 11, 5, 4>, <0, 11, 5, 6>, <0, 11, 8, 12>, <0, 11, 8, 3>, <0, 11, 5, 3>, <0, ...

Step 2: Cycles with exactly one chord (4-cycles):
<0, 11, 6, 5, (0, 5)>, <0, 11, 6, 5, (6, 11)>, <0, 11, 6, 5, (5, 6)>, <0, 11, 6, 5, (11, 0)>, <0, 11, 6, 5, (0, 11)>, <0, 11, 6, 5, (11, 6)>, <0, 11, 6, 5, (5, 0)>, <0, 11, 6, 5, (6, 5)>, <0, 11, 6, 5, (5, 11)>....

Step 3: Count the number of chordless 4-cycles:
[0]
