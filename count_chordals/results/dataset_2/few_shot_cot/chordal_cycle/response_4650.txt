Response:
Step 1: 
    - There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph, such as: <1, 7, 14, 5>, <1, 14, 17, 7>, <7, 17, 14, 5>, <11, 6, 1, 7>, <11, 10, 2, 4>, <15, 9, 11, 6>, etc.
    
Step 2:
    - Among these cycles, the cycle <1, 14, 7, 17> has exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle), which is the edge connecting vertices 7 and 14.
    
Step 3:
    - After checking all cycles, we found 1 chordal 4-cycle: <1, 7, 14, 17>.
    
Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in this graph is [1].
