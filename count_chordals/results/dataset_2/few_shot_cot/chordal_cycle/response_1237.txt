Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with every edge existing in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 6, 8, 5, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 8, 6, 0, 2>
- Cycle-4: <3, 9, 5, 1, 3>
- Cycle-5: <4, 9, 5, 0, 4>
- Cycle-6: <5, 9, 4, 0, 5>
- Cycle-7: <6, 8, 2, 4, 6>
- Cycle-8: <7, 0, 4, 9, 7>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 1, 6, 0> has chord (5, 1)
- <1, 6, 8, 5, 1> has chord (6, 5)
- <2, 8, 6, 0, 2> has chord (8, 0)
- <3, 9, 5, 1, 3> has chord (9, 5)
- <4, 9, 5, 0, 4> has chord (9, 5)
- <5, 9, 4, 0, 5> has chord (9, 4)
- <6, 8, 2, 4, 6> has chord (8, 2)
- <7, 0, 4, 9, 7> has chord (0, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [0] chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
