Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 2 <0, 14, 3, 15> has 1 chord (edge 3, 14).
- Cycle 4 <3, 15, 21, 1> has 1 chord (edge 15, 1).
- Cycle 11 <3, 14, 26, 20> has 1 chord (edge 14, 26).
- Cycle 14 <5, 25, 1, 21> has 1 chord (edge 25, 21).
- Cycle 23 <9, 25, 1, 26> has 1 chord (edge 25, 1).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordless cycles: [39]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, 14, 3, 15>
<3, 15, 21, 1>
<5, 25, 1, 21>
<9, 25, 1, 26>
<3, 14, 26, 20>
