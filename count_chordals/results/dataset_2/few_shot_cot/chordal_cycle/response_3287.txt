Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 1, 5, 3, 0>
- <0, 1, 4, 2, 0>
- <1, 4, 6, 2, 1>
- <1, 5, 9, 6, 1>
- <2, 4, 6, 5, 2>
- <3, 5, 9, 3>
- <3, 0, 1, 5, 3>
- <4, 6, 5, 8, 4>
- <5, 6, 9, 3, 5>
- <7, 9, 5, 8, 7>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<1, 5, 9, 6, (2, 4), 1>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have one, so the final answer is [1].
