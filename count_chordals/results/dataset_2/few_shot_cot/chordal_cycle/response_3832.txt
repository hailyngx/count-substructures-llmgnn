Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 9, 11, 0> with edges (0, 9), (9, 11), (11, 0), (0, 13), and (13, 0)
2. Cycle <0, 1, 2, 3> with edges (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0), and (0, 13)
3. Cycle <0, 1, 14, 4> with edges (0, 1), (1, 14), (14, 4), (4, 10), and (10, 0)
4. Cycle <0, 13, 5, 10> with edges (0, 13), (13, 5), (5, 10), (10, 12), and (12, 0)
5. Cycle <1, 2, 6, 9> with edges (1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 9), (9, 4), and (4, 1)
6. Cycle <2, 3, 8, 11> with edges (2, 3), (3, 8), (8, 11), (11, 3), and (3, 2)
7. Cycle <4, 10, 5, 13> with edges (4, 10), (10, 5), (5, 13), (13, 0), and (0, 4)
8. Cycle <6, 2, 1, 14> with edges (6, 2), (2, 1), (1, 14), (14, 8), and (8, 6)
9. Cycle <6, 9, 11, 3> with edges (6, 9), (9, 11), (11, 3), (3, 8), and (8, 6)
10. Cycle <8, 11, 14, 4> with edges (8, 11), (11, 14), (14, 4), (4, 14), and (14, 8)

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
<0, 9, 11, 0> with non-adjacent chords 13 and 4.

Step 3:
There is only one chordal 4-cycle found, so the total number of chordless cycles is [0].
