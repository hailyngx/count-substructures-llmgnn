Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 7) (6, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4: 
<0, 5, 1, 3, (0, 5)>
<1, 5, 8, 3, (1, 8)>
<2, 1, 7, 4, (2, 7)>
<3, 1, 7, 9, (3, 9)>
<4, 9, 8, 5, (4, 5)>
<6, 7, 1, 3, (6, 1)>
<8, 5, 3, 9, (8, 9)>
<9, 8, 2, 4, (9, 2)>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 5, 1, 3, (0, 5)>
<1, 5, 8, 3, (1, 8)>
<2, 1, 7, 4, (2, 7)>
<3, 1, 7, 9, (3, 9)>
<4, 9, 8, 5, (4, 5)>
<6, 7, 1, 3, (6, 1)>
<8, 5, 3, 9, (8, 9)>
<9, 8, 2, 4, (9, 2)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [8].
