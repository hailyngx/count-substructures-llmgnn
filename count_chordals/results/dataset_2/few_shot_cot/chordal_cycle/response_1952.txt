Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0
- Cycle 2: 0 -> 1 -> 7 -> 4 -> 0
- Cycle 3: 0 -> 1 -> 8 -> 5 -> 0
- Cycle 4: 1 -> 3 -> 9 -> 6 -> 1
- Cycle 5: 1 -> 7 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1
- Cycle 6: 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2
- Cycle 7: 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 8 -> 3
- Cycle 8: 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 9 -> 4
- Cycle 9: 5 -> 6 -> 8 -> 0 -> 5
- Cycle 10: 6 -> 8 -> 7 -> 2 -> 6
- Cycle 11: 7 -> 0 -> 1 -> 8 -> 7
- Cycle 12: 8 -> 0 -> 4 -> 7 -> 8
- Cycle 13: 8 -> 1 -> 3 -> 9 -> 8
- Cycle 14: 9 -> 3 -> 4 -> 7 -> 9

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 6 has a chord: Chord = (2, 4)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: Chord = (6, 2)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles:
There is only one chordless 4-cycle in this graph: [<0, 1, 8, 5>].

Therefore, the final count is [1].
