Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:  
1. <0, 14, 10, 4>  
2. <0, 14, 10, 5>  
3. <0, 3, 11, 13>  
4. <3, 6, 1, 8>  
5. <6, 19, 2, 7>  
6. <3, 5, 10, 14>  
7. <3, 6, 1, 8>  
8. <3, 5, 10, 7>  
9. <3, 6, 19, 15>  
10. <6, 19, 15, 18>  
11. <6, 1, 8, 12>  
12. <0, 15, 19, 6>  
13. <0, 15, 18, 5>  
14. <15, 19, 6, 3>  

Step 2:  
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:  
1. <0, 14, 10, 4> (chord: 10, 14)  
2. <3, 6, 1, 8> (chord: 1, 6)  

Step 3:  
Count of chordal 4-cycles = [2]
