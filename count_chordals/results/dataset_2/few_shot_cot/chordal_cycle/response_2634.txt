Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 16) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 16) (13, 7) (2, 18) (2, 10) (2, 17) (2, 15) (18, 2) (18, 4) (18, 5) (18, 15) (5, 18) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 17) (4, 18) (4, 19) (4, 14) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 19) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 15) (1, 17) (1, 16) (17, 2) (17, 6) (17, 1) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 11) (16, 8) (16, 13) (16, 1) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 15) (14, 4) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 11) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 7) (10, 9) (15, 2) (15, 18) (15, 12) (15, 11) (9, 10)

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the graph.

Step 2:
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, we cannot find any chordal 4-cycles.

Step 3:
- The final count of chordless cycles found is [0].
