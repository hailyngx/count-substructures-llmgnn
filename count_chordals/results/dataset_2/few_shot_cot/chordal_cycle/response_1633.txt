Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with all edges existing in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 7, 12, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 19, 11, 13, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 1, 3, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 16, 19, 5)
- Cycle 5: (3, 1, 4, 14, 16, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 1, 9, 5, 13, 11, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 11, 13, 17, 6, 8, 18, 17, 2, 7, 12, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 1, 9, 16, 14, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 0, 10, 7, 5, 13, 11, 4)
- Cycle 10: (7, 5, 13, 17, 6, 8, 18, 17, 2, 7)
- Cycle 11: (7, 19, 11, 13, 17, 6, 8, 18, 17, 2, 7)
- Cycle 12: (9, 5, 7, 2, 17, 13, 11, 9)
- Cycle 13: (11, 3, 1, 9, 16, 14, 4, 0, 10, 11)
- Cycle 14: (13, 5, 7, 2, 17, 6, 8, 18, 17, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <3, 5>
- Cycle 2 has a chord <11, 13>
- Cycle 3 has a chord <1, 9>
- Cycle 4 has a chord <5, 16>
- Cycle 5 has a chord <1, 14>
- Cycle 6 has a chord <5, 11>
- Cycle 7 has a chord <13, 17>
- Cycle 8 has a chord <9, 16>
- Cycle 9 has a chord <1, 10>
- Cycle 10 has a chord <7, 13>
- Cycle 11 has a chord <7, 13>
- Cycle 12 has a chord <5, 17>
- Cycle 13 has a chord <3, 16>
- Cycle 14 has a chord <7, 17>
