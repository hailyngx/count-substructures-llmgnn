Response:
There are not many chordal 4-cycles in the graph provided in this case. Let's go through the steps to find them:

Step 1: Identify all cycles of length 4 or more where every edge in the cycle exists. 
- One of the cycles is <2, 0, 23, 3>. 
- Another cycle is <4, 11, 29, 2>. 
- There are a few other cycles as well but they do not form chordal 4-cycles.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle <2, 0, 23, 3> does not have a chord. 
- Cycle <4, 11, 29, 2> has two chords: (4, 29) and (11, 2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
- There are no chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord in this graph is [0].
