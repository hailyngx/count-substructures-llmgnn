Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 5, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle: 1-9-6-2-1
    - Chords: (9,2) 
- Cycle: 1-3-5-4-1
    - Chords: (3,4) 
- Cycle: 5-4-6-8-5
    - Chords: (4,8) 

Step 2:
All the cycles listed in Step 1 have exactly one chord each.

Step 3:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. 

Therefore, the final count is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are: 
- <1, 9, 6, 2> with chord (9, 2)
- <1, 3, 5, 4> with chord (3, 4)
- <5, 4, 6, 8> with chord (4, 8)
