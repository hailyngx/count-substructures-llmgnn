Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 1, 7, 5>
- Cycle 4: <9, 8, 3, 6, 9>
- Cycle 5: <9, 8, 2, 6, 9>
- Cycle 6: <9, 8, 0, 6, 9>
- Cycle 7: <6, 4, 5, 9, 6>
- Cycle 8: <6, 4, 9, 8, 6>
- Cycle 9: <6, 3, 8, 2, 6>
- Cycle 10: <6, 0, 8, 2, 6>
- Cycle 11: <3, 8, 2, 6, 3>
- Cycle 12: <5, 4, 6, 0, 5>
- Cycle 13: <1, 5, 7, 2, 1>
- Cycle 14: <1, 7, 0, 6, 1>
- Cycle 15: <7, 5, 9, 1, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 1, 5> has a chord (9, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 1, 7, 5> has a chord (1, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
Since there are 15 cycles listed and 2 of them have chords, the number of chordless cycles is 15 - 2 = 13.

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
