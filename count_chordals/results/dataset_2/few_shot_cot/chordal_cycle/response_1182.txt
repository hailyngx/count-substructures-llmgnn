Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <1, 5, 9, 6, 1>
- <1, 5, 9, 2, 1>
- <1, 5, 9, 3, 1>
- <1, 5, 9, 7, 1>
- <1, 6, 9, 5, 1>
- <1, 6, 9, 7, 1>
- <1, 9, 5, 2, 1>
- <1, 9, 6, 7, 1>
- <1, 9, 7, 8, 1>
- <1, 3, 9, 5, 1>
- <1, 3, 9, 6, 1>
- <1, 3, 4, 1, 5>
- <1, 3, 4, 0, 5>
- <1, 4, 3, 9, 1>
- <1, 4, 3, 6, 1>
- <1, 4, 0, 5, 1>
- <2, 5, 9, 3, 2>
- <2, 5, 9, 7, 2>
- <2, 9, 5, 1, 2>
- <2, 9, 1, 5, 2>
- <2, 9, 7, 8, 2>
- <3, 9, 5, 1, 3>
- <3, 9, 6, 1, 3>
- <3, 9, 7, 8, 3>
- <3, 6, 9, 5, 3>
- <3, 6, 1, 5, 3>
- <3, 4, 1, 5, 3>
- <3, 4, 0, 5, 3>
- <3, 4, 1, 6, 3>
- <4, 1, 5, 9, 4>
- <4, 1, 6, 3, 4>
- <4, 0, 5, 1, 4>
- <4, 0, 5, 9, 4>

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, 5, (9, 6), 1>
- <1, 5, (9, 2), 1>
- <1, 5, (9, 3), 1>
- <1, 5, (9, 7), 1>
- <1, 6, (9, 5), 1>
- <1, 6, (9, 7), 1>
- <1, 9, (5, 2), 1>
- <1, 9, (6, 7), 1>
- <1, 9, (7, 8), 1>
- <1, 3, (9, 5), 1>
- <1, 3, (9, 6), 1>
- <1, 3, 4, 1, 5>
- <1, 3, 4, 0, 5>
- <1, 4, (3, 9), 1>
- <1, 4, (3, 6), 1>
- <1, 4, 0, 5, 1>
- <2, 5, (9, 3), 2>
- <2, 5, (9, 7), 2>
- <2, 9, (5, 1), 2>
- <2, 9, (7, 8), 2>
- <3, 9, (5, 1), 3>
- <3, 9, (6, 1), 3>
- <3, 9, (7, 8), 3>
- <3, 6, (9, 5), 3>
- <3, 6, 1, 5, 3>
- <3, 4, 1, 5, 3>
- <3, 4, 0, 5, 3>
- <3, 4, (1, 6), 3>
- <4, 1, (5, 9), 4>
- <4, 1, 6, (3, 4), 4>
- <4, 0, 5, 1, 4>
- <4, 0, 5, 9, 4>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles = [22]
