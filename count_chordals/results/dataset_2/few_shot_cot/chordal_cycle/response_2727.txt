Response:
The chordless 4-cycles in the provided graph are as follows:

Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (11, 9, 5, 6, 11)
- Cycle 2: (14, 1, 3, 5, 14)
- Cycle 3: (2, 1, 4, 3, 2)
- Cycle 4: (4, 1, 14, 6, 4)
- Cycle 5: (0, 9, 5, 3, 0)
- Cycle 6: (7, 0, 2, 1, 7)
- Cycle 7: (12, 10, 7, 14, 12)
- Cycle 8: (13, 3, 4, 6, 13)
- Cycle 9: (8, 4, 1, 2, 8)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (5, 6).
- Cycle 2 has a chord (3, 14).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (1, 4).
- Cycle 4 has a chord (1, 6).
- Cycle 5 has a chord (5, 9).
- Cycle 6 has a chord (0, 2).
- Cycle 7 has a chord (7, 14).
- Cycle 8 has a chord (3, 6).
- Cycle 9 has a chord (1, 2).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordless 4-cycles in the provided graph.
