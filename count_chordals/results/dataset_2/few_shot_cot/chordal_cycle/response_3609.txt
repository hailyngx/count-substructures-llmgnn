Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
<0, 11, 3, 15>, <0, 3, 15, 6>, <0, 3, 7, 2>, <0, 3, 11, 11>, <0, 3, 9, 18>, <0, 13, 4, 16>, <1, 13, 4, 16>, <2, 9, 18, 16>, <2, 9, 3, 15>, <2, 9, 10, 4>, <2, 7, 14, 17>, <3, 11, 0, 13>, <3, 15, 6, 8>, <3, 15, 2, 7>, <3, 15, 11, 0>, <3, 7, 14, 17>, <4, 16, 1, 13>, <4, 16, 5, 17>, <4, 10, 12, 14>, <4, 10, 19, 8>, <4, 13, 1, 16>, <5, 17, 14, 12>, <6, 15, 3, 11>, <6, 15, 2, 9>, <6, 15, 8, 19>, <6, 7, 14, 12>, <7, 3, 0, 13>, <7, 14, 12, 10>, <7, 2, 9, 18>, <8, 6, 15, 3>, <8, 6, 19, 10>, <8, 19, 10, 12>, <9, 3, 0, 13>, <9, 2, 7, 14>, <9, 18, 16, 1>, <9, 18, 16, 4>, <9, 10, 4, 13>, <10, 12, 14, 17>, <10, 12, 4, 16>, <10, 4, 13, 1>, <10, 4, 16, 18>, <11, 0, 13, 4>, <12, 14, 17, 5>, <13, 0, 11, 3>, <14, 17, 5, 4>, <15, 6, 8, 19>, <16, 18, 9, 2>, <17, 5, 4, 13>, <18, 16, 1, 13>, <19, 8, 6, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
Chordless cycles are:
<0, 3, 15, 6>, <0, 3, 7, 2>, <0, 3, 11, 11>, <2, 9, 18, 16>, <2, 9, 3, 15>, <3, 15, 6, 8>, <3, 15, 2, 7>, <3, 7, 14, 17>, <4, 16, 1, 13>, <4, 16, 5, 17>, <4, 10, 12, 14>, <4, 10, 19, 8>, <5, 17, 14, 12>, <6, 15, 3, 11>, <6, 15, 2, 9>, <6, 7, 14, 12>, <8, 6, 15, 3>, <8, 6, 19, 10>, <8, 19, 10, 12>, <9, 18, 16, 1>, <9, 18, 16, 4>, <9, 10, 4, 13>, <10, 12, 14, 17>, <10, 12, 4, 16>, <10, 4, 13, 1>, <10, 4, 16, 18>, <13, 0, 11, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [26] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
