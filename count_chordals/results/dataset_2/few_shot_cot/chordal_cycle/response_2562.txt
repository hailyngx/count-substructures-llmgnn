Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 8, 1, 3>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 4, 6, 8>
- Cycle 4: <1, 3, 7, 9, 4>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 6, 5, 8>
- Cycle 6: <2, 0, 8, 6, 4>
- Cycle 7: <2, 1, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 6, 5, 7>
- Cycle 9: <3, 1, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 10: <3, 1, 4, 9, 7>
- Cycle 11: <3, 1, 2, 9, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 6, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 13: <4, 9, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 14: <4, 2, 1, 3, 7>
- Cycle 15: <5, 6, 4, 9, 7>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).  

Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord found:  
- <0, 5, (8, 1), 3>  
- <0, 9, (4, 6), 8>  
- <1, 3, (7, 9), 4>  
- <1, 4, (6, 5), 8>  
- <2, 0, (8, 6), 4>  
- <2, 1, (4, 6), 5>  
- <2, 4, (6, 5), 7>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
- There are 8 chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord.  

Put the final number inside brackets to complete the task.  
Therefore, the answer is [8].
