Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 9, 6, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 3, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 2, 8, 1, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 8, 2, 6, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 6, 9, 7, 1, 8, 3, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 9, 6, 4, 0, 3>
- Cycle 8: <4, 9, 6, 7, 5, 0, 4>
- Cycle 9: <6, 9, 3, 2, 8, 1, 7, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (1, 5), [0, 5, 7, 1, 0]
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (0, 6), [0, 4, 9, 6, 2, 0]
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (0, 2), [0, 4, 3, 2, 0]
- Cycle 4 has no chord
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has no chord
- Cycle 7 has no chord
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (0, 6), [0, 4, 9, 6, 7, 0]
- Cycle 9 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 5, 7, 1> with chord (1, 5)
<0, 4, 9, 6, 2> with chord (0, 6)
<0, 4, 3, 2> with chord (0, 2)
