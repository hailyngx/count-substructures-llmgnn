Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 13, 15, 1> has a chord (13, 15)
- The cycle <0, 14, 18, 1> has a chord (0, 18)
- The cycle <0, 8, 11, 6> has a chord (8, 6)
- The cycle <0, 8, 17, 13> has a chord (8, 13)
- The cycle <13, 15, 6, 2> has a chord (15, 2)
- The cycle <5, 12, 18, 1> has a chord (12, 1)
- The cycle <6, 14, 18, 1> has a chord (14, 18)
- The cycle <7, 2, 16, 10> has a chord (2, 16)
- The cycle <8, 0, 13, 17> has a chord (0, 17)
- The cycle <8, 13, 17, 4> has a chord (13, 4)
- The cycle <8, 17, 13, 4> has a chord (17, 4)
- The cycle <12, 18, 5, 13> has a chord (18, 5)
- The cycle <18, 9, 10, 16> has a chord (9, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [18]
