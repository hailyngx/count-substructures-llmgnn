Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
From the given graph, we can find the following cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle <4, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle <1, 6, 9, 7>
- Cycle <2, 7, 0, 8>

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. Cycle <4, 9, 6, 0> has one chord (4, 6): <4, (4, 6), 9, 6, 0>
2. Cycle <1, 6, 9, 7> has one chord (1, 9): <1, (1, 9), 6, 9, 7>
3. Cycle <2, 7, 0, 8> has one chord (2, 0): <2, (2, 0), 7, 0, 8>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
