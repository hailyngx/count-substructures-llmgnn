Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle: 0 - 5 - 9 - 13
- Cycle: 0 - 5 - 14 - 4
- Cycle: 0 - 12 - 6 - 11
- Cycle: 1 - 8 - 10 - 2
- Cycle: 3 - 9 - 13 - 4
- Cycle: 3 - 9 - 8 - 6
- Cycle: 3 - 12 - 6 - 14
- Cycle: 4 - 5 - 9 - 8
- Cycle: 4 - 5 - 14 - 6
- Cycle: 5 - 9 - 8 - 6
- Cycle: 5 - 12 - 6 - 14
- Cycle: 6 - 8 - 10 - 7
- Cycle: 6 - 11 - 0 - 5
- Cycle: 6 - 12 - 0 - 5
- Cycle: 6 - 12 - 3 - 9

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle: 0 - 5 - 9 - 13, Chord: (9, 13)
- Cycle: 1 - 8 - 10 - 2, Chord: (8, 10)

Step 3:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, 5, 9, 13>, with chord (9, 13)
- <1, 8, 10, 2>, with chord (8, 10)
