Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <4, 2, 1, 6>
- Cycle 2: <4, 2, 3, 8>
- Cycle 3: <7, 6, 9, 3>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 2, 6>
- Cycle 5: <0, 4, 3, 9>
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 9, 3>
- Cycle 7: <2, 4, 0, 1>
- Cycle 8: <3, 0, 1, 6>
- Cycle 9: <2, 4, 3, 5>
- Cycle 10: <6, 1, 0, 4>
- Cycle 11: <6, 1, 2, 4>
- Cycle 12: <6, 1, 4, 3>
- Cycle 13: <9, 3, 0, 4>
- Cycle 14: <9, 3, 4, 2>
- Cycle 15: <9, 3, 2, 6>
- Cycle 16: <5, 3, 8, 3>
- Cycle 17: <6, 9, 3, 0>
- Cycle 18: <4, 0, 1, 2>
- Cycle 19: <1, 0, 3, 4>
- Cycle 20: <0, 3, 2, 4>
- Cycle 21: <9, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 22: <9, 6, 2, 4>
- Cycle 23: <3, 4, 0, 2>
- Cycle 24: <3, 4, 2, 6>
- Cycle 25: <3, 4, 2, 9>
- Cycle 26: <0, 1, 6, 9>
- Cycle 27: <3, 2, 6, 9>
- Cycle 28: <3, 2, 4, 0>
- Cycle 29: <3, 2, 9, 6>
- Cycle 30: <2, 1, 6, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycles:
  - <4, 2, 1, 6> (Chord: (1, 6))
  - <7, 6, 9, 3> (Chord: (6, 9))
  - <0, 4, 3, 9> (Chord: (3, 9))
  - <1, 6, 9, 3> (Chord: (6, 9))
  - <2, 4, 3, 5> (Chord: (3, 5))
  - <6, 1, 0, 4> (Chord: (0, 4))
  - <6, 1, 2, 4> (Chord: (1, 2))
  - <6, 1, 4, 3> (Chord: (1, 4))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found. 

- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]
