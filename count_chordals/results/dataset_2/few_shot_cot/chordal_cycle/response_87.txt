Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- <2, 24, 11, 2>
- <4, 8, 16, 12, 4>
- <4, 8, 15, 6, 27, 14, 13, 4>
- <4, 8, 26, 15, 6, 27, 14, 13, 4>
- <4, 10, 12, 19, 11, 24, 20, 14, 13, 4>
- <4, 10, 20, 24, 11, 19, 27, 14, 13, 4>
- <4, 21, 20, 24, 11, 19, 27, 14, 13, 4>
- <4, 21, 20, 18, 25, 13, 4>
- <5, 25, 18, 9, 24, 20, 14, 13, 5>
- <7, 28, 1, 7>
- <9, 22, 12, 16, 3, 0, 7, 28, 26, 15, 6, 27, 14, 20, 18, 25, 13, 17, 23, 4, 10, 12, 19, 11, 24, 20, 21, 4>
- <11, 2, 24, 20, 18, 25, 13, 14, 27, 19, 29, 11>
- <13, 17, 23, 4, 10, 12, 19, 27, 14, 20, 18, 25, 13>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <4, 8, 16, 12, 4> (Chord: (4, 12))
- <4, 8, 15, 6, 27, 14, 13, 4> (Chord: (6, 14))
- <4, 10, 12, 19, 11, 24, 20, 14, 13, 4> (Chord: (11, 20))
- <4, 10, 20, 24, 11, 19, 27, 14, 13, 4> (Chord: (11, 27))
- <5, 25, 18, 9, 24, 20, 14, 13, 5> (Chord: (9, 18))

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [5].
