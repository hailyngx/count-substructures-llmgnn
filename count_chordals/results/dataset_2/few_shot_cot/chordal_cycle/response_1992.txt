Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <13, 29, 1, 21>
- Cycle 2: <7, 18, 3, 27>
- Cycle 3: <9, 8, 29, 18>
- Cycle 4: <14, 5, 23, 3>
- Cycle 5: <6, 17, 25, 22>
- Cycle 6: <15, 27, 26, 20>
- Cycle 7: <0, 20, 1, 21>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1 has chord (1, 29)
- Cycle 2 has chord (18, 3)
- Cycle 3 has chord (8, 18)
- Cycle 4 has chord (5, 23)
- Cycle 5 is chordal with chord (17, 22)
- Cycle 6 has chord (26, 20)
- Cycle 7 is chordal with chord (20, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are two chordless cycles: Cycle 5 and Cycle 7.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [2].
