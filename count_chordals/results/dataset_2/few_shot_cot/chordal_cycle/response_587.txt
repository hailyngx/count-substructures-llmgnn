Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 23, 2, 12, 5>
- <1, 17, 20, 5, 28>
- <1, 23, 18, 7, 4>
- <2, 3, 25, 16, 28>
- <2, 3, 25, 15, 19>
- <2, 12, 17, 5, 28>
- <3, 25, 16, 28, 12>
- <4, 7, 22, 21, 10>
- <4, 7, 22, 6, 22>
- <4, 9, 29, 27, 14>
- <5, 10, 21, 26, 25>
- <7, 14, 27, 29, 10>
- <9, 16, 25, 3, 8>
- <9, 21, 26, 25, 16>
- <9, 21, 26, 25, 3>
- <9, 29, 10, 21, 22>
- <9, 29, 27, 14, 7>
  
Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 23, 2, 12, 5> has no chord.
- <1, 17, 20, 5, 28> has no chord.
- <1, 23, 18, 7, 4> has chord (7, 14).
- <2, 3, 25, 16, 28> has chord (25, 15).
- <2, 3, 25, 15, 19> has chord (3, 16).
- <2, 12, 17, 5, 28> has no chord.
- <3, 25, 16, 28, 12> has no chord.
- <4, 7, 22, 21, 10> has no chord.
- <4, 7, 22, 6, 22> has chord (7, 22).
- <4, 9, 29, 27, 14> has no chord.
- <5, 10, 21, 26, 25> has no chord.
- <7, 14, 27, 29, 10> has no chord.
- <9, 16, 25, 3, 8> has no chord.
- <9, 21, 26, 25, 16> has no chord.
- <9, 21, 26, 25, 3> has no chord.
- <9, 29, 10, 21, 22> has no chord.
- <9, 29, 27, 14, 7> has no chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 8 chordless cycles found.

Final count: [8]
