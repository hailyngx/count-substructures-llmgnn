64. <14, 7, 3, 1, 14>

Step 2: Check for a chord in each cycle:
- Only the following cycles have exactly one chord:
1. <1, 3, 7, 6, 1> (Chord: (1, 7))
2. <1, 11, 6, 9, 1> (Chord: (1, 9))
3. <6, 7, 14, 9, 6> (Chord: (6, 14))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles = [61 - 3] = [58].

Therefore, the answer is [58].
