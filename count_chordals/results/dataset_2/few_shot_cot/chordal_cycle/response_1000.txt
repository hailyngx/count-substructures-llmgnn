Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 9, 4, 1, 0>
- <0, 9, 2, 5, 1, 0>
- <1, 5, 6, 7, 1>
- <1, 6, 7, 8, 1>
- <1, 6, 5, 2, 1>
- <1, 6, 3, 9, 2, 1>
- <2, 5, 6, 3, 9, 2>
- <2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2>
- <2, 5, 1, 4, 9, 2>
- <2, 5, 1, 0, 9, 2>
- <2, 5, 1, 6, 7, 2>
- <2, 5, 1, 8, 7, 2>
- <2, 9, 4, 1, 0, 2>
- <2, 9, 3, 6, 5, 2>
- <2, 9, 3, 8, 7, 2>
- <3, 9, 4, 1, 6, 3>
- <3, 9, 4, 7, 8, 3>
- <3, 9, 2, 5, 1, 3>
- <3, 9, 2, 8, 7, 3>

Step 2:
From the list of cycles above, we have two chordal 4-cycles:
1. <2, 5, 6, 3>, with a chord (2, 3)
2. <3, 9, 2, 5>, with a chord (3, 2)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [16].
