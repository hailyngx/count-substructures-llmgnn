Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
<3, 5, 9, 8>
<4, 5, 8, 3>
<4, 6, 3, 1>
<2, 4, 1, 3>
<2, 6, 3, 5>
<0, 9, 5, 8>
<0, 7, 5, 3>
<0, 7, 2, 1>
<0, 9, 8, 5>
<0, 9, 3, 1>

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
<3, 5, 9, 8>   Chord: (5, 9)
<4, 5, 8, 3>   Chord: (5, 8)
<2, 4, 1, 3>   Chord: (4, 1)
<2, 6, 3, 5>   Chord: (6, 5)
<0, 9, 5, 8>   Chord: (9, 5)

Step 3: 
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
