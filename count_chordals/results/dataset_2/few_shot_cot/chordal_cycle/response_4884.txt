Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are four cycles of length 4 in this graph:
1. Cycle: 5 - 2 - 1 - 5
2. Cycle: 5 - 3 - 0 - 9
3. Cycle: 5 - 4 - 7 - 5
4. Cycle: 5 - 7 - 8 - 9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Out of the above cycles, the cycle 5 - 2 - 1 - 5 has exactly one chord (2, 1). All other cycles have either zero or more than one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

List of unique chordal 4-cycle:
<5, (2, 1), 1>
