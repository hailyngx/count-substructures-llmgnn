2. <0, 5, 17, 16, 6, (5, 6)>
3. <0, 5, 17, 16, 1, (5, 1)>
4. <0, 13, 14, 7, 18, (14, 7)>
5. <0, 13, 14, 8, 19, (14, 8)>
6. <0, 13, 14, 15, 10, (14, 15)>
7. <0, 13, 14, 19, 11, (14, 11)>

13. <2, 6, 0, 13, 14, (6, 13)>
14. <2, 15, 14, 7, 18, (14, 18)>
15. <4, 6, 0, 13, 14, (6, 13)>
16. <6, 2, 15, 14, 7, (2, 14)>
17. <8, 13, 14, 7, 18, (13, 18)>
18. <8, 19, 11, 19, 14, (19, 14)>
19. <10, 15, 14, 7, 18, (15, 18)>
20. <13, 14, 19, 11, 19, (14, 19)>
