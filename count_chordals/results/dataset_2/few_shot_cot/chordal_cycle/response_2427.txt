Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-5-4-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-7-5-3-0
- Cycle 3: 1-5-4-7-1
- Cycle 4: 1-7-2-3-1
- Cycle 5: 2-7-1-5-2
- Cycle 6: 3-5-8-6-3
- Cycle 7: 4-5-7-2-4
- Cycle 8: 6-3-2-0-6
- Cycle 9: 6-4-5-7-6
- Cycle 10: 9-8-5-1-9

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 3, 5, 7> (chord: (1, 7))
- <1, 5, 7, 2> (chord: (5, 7))
- <2, 5, 7, 1> (chord: (5, 7))
- <3, 5, 8, 6> (chord: (3, 8))

Step 3:
Number of chordless 4-cycles: [6]
