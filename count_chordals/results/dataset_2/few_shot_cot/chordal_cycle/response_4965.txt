Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <6, 14, 17, 7, 6>
- Cycle <0, 5, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle <0, 5, 4, 10, 0>
- Cycle <1, 7, 17, 14, 1>
- Cycle <1, 15, 9, 18, 14, 17, 7, 5, 0, 11, 13, 4, 10, 16, 19, 6, 15, 1>
- Cycle <4, 10, 11, 13, 4>
- Cycle <5, 7, 17, 12, 0, 5>
- Cycle <6, 15, 9, 18, 13, 11, 0, 5, 3, 7, 2, 8, 11, 10, 4, 13, 18, 14, 6>
- Cycle <10, 11, 0, 12, 17, 14, 6, 19, 16, 10>
- Cycle <11, 13, 18, 9, 15, 6, 19, 16, 10, 4, 5, 0, 11>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal cycle <1, (15, 9), 18, (13, 4), 10, 11>

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
