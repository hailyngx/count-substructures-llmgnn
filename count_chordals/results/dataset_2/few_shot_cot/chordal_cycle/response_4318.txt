Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:

1. <1, 5, 8, 7, 4, (1, 8)>
2. <1, 5, 7, 6, (1, 7)>
3. <1, 6, 7, 4, (1, 4)>
4. <3, 9, 8, 7, 4, (3, 8)>
5. <3, 9, 8, 5, (3, 5)>
6. <3, 7, 6, 2, (3, 6)>
7. <3, 7, 4, 8, (3, 4)>
8. <7, 5, 2, 6, (7, 2)>
9. <7, 5, 1, 6, (7, 1)>
10. <8, 5, 1, 6, (8, 1)>
11. <8, 5, 7, 4, (8, 7)>
12. <8, 4, 3, 9, (8, 9)>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. <1, 5, 8, 7, 4, (1, 8)> - Not a chordal 4-cycle
2. <1, 5, 7, 6, (1, 7)> - Chordal 4-cycle
3. <1, 6, 7, 4, (1, 4)> - Chordal 4-cycle
4. <3, 9, 8, 7, 4, (3, 8)> - Not a chordal 4-cycle
5. <3, 9, 8, 5, (3, 5)> - Not a chordal 4-cycle
6. <3, 7, 6, 2, (3, 6)> - Chordal 4-cycle
7. <3, 7, 4, 8, (3, 4)> - Not a chordal 4-cycle
8. <7, 5, 2, 6, (7, 2)> - Chordal 4-cycle
9. <7, 5, 1, 6, (7, 1)> - Not a chordal 4-cycle
10. <8, 5, 1, 6, (8, 1)> - Not a chordal 4-cycle
11. <8, 5, 7, 4, (8, 7)> - Not a chordal 4-cycle
12. <8, 4, 3, 9, (8, 9)> - Chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]
