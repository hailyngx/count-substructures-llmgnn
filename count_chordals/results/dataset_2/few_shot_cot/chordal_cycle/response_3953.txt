Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 3, 16, 10>: Chord = (3,16)
- <0, 11, 25, 1, 5>: Chord = (11, 1)
- <1, 3, 16, 20>: Chord = (3, 16)
- <1, 3, 16, 10>: Chord = (3, 16)
- <1, 5, 20, 4>: Chord = (5, 20)
- <4, 20, 26, 11>: Chord = (20, 11)
- <4, 18, 24, 2>: Chord = (18, 24)
- <5, 20, 16, 3>: Chord = (20, 16)
- <5, 20, 26, 11>: Chord = (20, 26)
- <7, 17, 22, 8>: Chord = (17, 22)
- <13, 2, 24, 18>: Chord = (2, 24)
- <22, 17, 1, 3>: Chord = (17, 1)
- <23, 9, 6, 8, 22>: Chord = (9, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles found = [89]
