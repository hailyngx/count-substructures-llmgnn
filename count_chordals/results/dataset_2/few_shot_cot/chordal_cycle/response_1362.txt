Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <6, 14, 13, 10>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 2, 3>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 3, 7>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 11, 12>
- Cycle 5: <1, 2, 9, 14>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 8, 6>
- Cycle 7: <2, 3, 8, 12>
- Cycle 8: <5, 9, 14, 6>
- Cycle 9: <5, 10, 13, 6>
- Cycle 10: <5, 11, 7, 0>
- Cycle 11: <5, 11, 14, 4>
- Cycle 12: <5, 4, 8, 2>
- Cycle 13: <8, 6, 14, 9>
- Cycle 14: <8, 12, 11, 7>
- Cycle 15: <9, 14, 11, 7>
- Cycle 16: <9, 14, 10, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 1, 2, 3, (1, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 1, 3, 7, (3, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 7, 11, 12, (7, 11)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 2, 9, 14, (2, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, 3, 8, 6, (3, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <2, 3, 8, 12, (3, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, 9, 14, 6, (9, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, 10, 13, 6, (10, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <5, 11, 7, 0, (7, 11)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <5, 11, 14, 4, (11, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <5, 4, 8, 2, (4, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <8, 6, 14, 9, (6, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <8, 12, 11, 7, (11, 12)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <9, 14, 11, 7, (11, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <9, 14, 10, 5, (9, 14)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 15 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [15].
