Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 3, 1, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 9, 7, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 4, 7, 0)
- Cycle 4: (1, 4, 7, 9, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 6, 2, 9, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 9, 7, 4, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 9, 7, 0, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 1, 0, 3, 2)
- Cycle 10: (3, 5, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 5, 9, 2, 3)
- Cycle 12: (5, 9, 2, 6, 5)
- Cycle 13: (9, 2, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 14: (9, 7, 4, 1, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (5, 9). Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, (5, 9), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
As there is one chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [13].
