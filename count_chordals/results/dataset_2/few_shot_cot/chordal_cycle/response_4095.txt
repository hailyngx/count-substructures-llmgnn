Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle <0, 4, 5, 9> 
2. Cycle <0, 4, 8, 9> 
3. Cycle <1, 4, 8, 9> 
4. Cycle <0, 2, 9, 3> 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Cycle <0, 4, 5, 9> has chord (4, 9)
2. Cycle <0, 4, 8, 9> has chord (4, 8)
3. Cycle <1, 4, 8, 9> has chord (4, 8)
4. Cycle <0, 2, 9, 3> has chord (2, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
Only 0 chordless cycle is found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
