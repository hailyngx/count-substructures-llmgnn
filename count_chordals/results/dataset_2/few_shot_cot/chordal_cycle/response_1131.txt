Response:
Step 1:\
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 8, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 2, 4, 8, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 3, 0, 8, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 0, 8, 9, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 6, 7, 3, 0, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 6, 9, 8, 4, 5)
- Cycle 8: (1, 2, 4, 3, 0, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 2, 7, 5, 6, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 8, 4, 3, 7, 1)
- Cycle 11: (2, 4, 3, 7, 2)
- Cycle 12: (5, 3, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 13: (6, 9, 8, 0, 6)
- Cycle 14: (0, 8, 1, 5, 0)
- Cycle 15: (0, 7, 5, 6, 0)
- Cycle 16: (3, 0, 6, 5, 3)
- Cycle 17: (3, 7, 2, 1, 3)
- Cycle 18: (4, 8, 0, 6, 4)
- Cycle 19: (7, 5, 1, 8, 7)
- Cycle 20: (9, 8, 4, 2, 9)

Step 2:\
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (1, 8), 9, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (7, 2), 4, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (7, 3), 0, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (6, 9), 8, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (2, 4), 3, 0, 1>

Step 3:\
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is 5.\
Therefore, the final count is [5].
