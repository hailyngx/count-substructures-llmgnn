Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- <0, 6, 8, 1, 0> 
- <0, 6, 5, 9, 2, 0> 
- <0, 6, 5, 7, 0> 
- <0, 6, 4, 2, 0> 
- <0, 7, 1, 8, 0> 
- <0, 7, 3, 2, 0> 
- <0, 7, 5, 6, 0> 
- <0, 4, 2, 9, 5, 6, 0> 
- <0, 4, 3, 2, 9, 5, 6, 0> 
- <1, 8, 3, 7, 5, 9, 2, 0, 6, 4, 1> 

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are: 
- <0, 6, 5, 9, 2, 0> (Chord: (2, 9))
- <0, 4, 2, 9, 5, 6, 0> (Chord: (4, 6))

Step 3:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [2].
