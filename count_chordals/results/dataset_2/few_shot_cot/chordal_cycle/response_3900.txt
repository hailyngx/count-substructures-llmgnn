Response:
Steps to find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- The cycles in the given graph are:
1. <0, 3, 10, 4>
2. <0, 3, 1, 12>
3. <0, 3, 9, 8>
4. <0, 12, 1, 4>
5. <1, 4, 13, 12>
6. <1, 4, 3, 9>
7. <1, 4, 13, 5>
8. <1, 8, 9, 3>
9. <1, 8, 6, 5>
10. <1, 8, 6, 14>
11. <1, 12, 13, 5>
12. <1, 14, 9, 3>
13. <1, 14, 6, 5>
14. <2, 3, 1, 4>
15. <2, 3, 10, 6>
16. <2, 6, 5, 13>
17. <2, 6, 14, 10>
18. <2, 11, 1, 4>
19. <2, 11, 13, 5>
20. <3, 9, 8, 6>
21. <3, 10, 6, 5>
22. <3, 10, 14, 6>
23. <4, 13, 12, 1>
24. <5, 13, 12, 1>
25. <5, 13, 2, 11>
26. <5, 14, 6, 2>
27. <6, 14, 10, 4>
28. <12, 1, 4, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord in the given graph is:
[1]

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordless 4-cycles = 28 - 1 = 27

Therefore, the final answer is [27].
