Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 5, 9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 5, 9, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 2, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 4: (0, 8, 9, 2, 1, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 1, 6, 5, 7, 0)
- Cycle 6: (5, 9, 8, 7, 5)
- Cycle 7: (7, 5, 3, 1, 7)
- Cycle 8: (7, 4, 2, 1, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 6, 1, 9, 7)
- Cycle 10: (7, 8, 2, 9, 7)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1, <(1, 6), (5, 9)>
- Cycle 2, <(1, 3), (5, 9)>
- Cycle 3, <(1, 2), (4, 7)>
- Cycle 4, <(0, 8), (2, 9)>
- Cycle 5, <(0, 1), (5, 7)>
- Cycle 6, <(5, 8), (7, 9)>
- Cycle 7, <(1, 3), (5, 7)>
- Cycle 8, <(1, 2), (4, 7)>
- Cycle 9, <(1, 6), (9, 7)>
- Cycle 10, <(7, 8), (2, 9)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
