Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. We will list them below:

<0, 9, 5, 7, 4>
<0, 9, 5, 8, 4>
<3, 6, 7, 4, 8>
<1, 9, 5, 7, 4>
<1, 9, 5, 8, 4>
<1, 3, 7, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 7, 6, 8>
<2, 1, 9, 5, 7>
<2, 1, 9, 5, 8>
<2, 1, 3, 7, 4>
<2, 1, 3, 7, 6>
<7, 5, 9, 1, 3>
<7, 5, 9, 1, 8>
<7, 3, 6, 8, 5>
<7, 3, 1, 9, 5>

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, the following cycles have exactly one chord:
<0, 9, (5, 8), 4>
<2, 1, (3, 7), 4>
<7, 5, 9, (1, 8), 3>
<7, 3, (6, 8), 5>

Step 3: 
There are a total of [4] unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph: 
<0, 9, (5, 8), 4>
<2, 1, (3, 7), 4>
<7, 5, 9, (1, 8), 3>
<7, 3, (6, 8), 5>
