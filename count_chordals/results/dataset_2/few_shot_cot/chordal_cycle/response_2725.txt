Response:
Step 1: Cycles of length 4 or more are <0, 7, 4, 1>, <0, 7, 5, 11>, <1, 4, 7, 12>, <1, 4, 11, 5>, <1, 3, 4, 7>, <1, 3, 11, 5>, <2, 1, 4, 7>, <2, 1, 12, 10>, <2, 1, 14, 6>, <2, 6, 14, 0>, <2, 6, 8, 13>, <2, 6, 8, 9>, <2, 6, 14, 9>, <2, 12, 7, 0>, <2, 12, 1, 3>, <2, 12, 10, 13>, <3, 1, 4, 7>, <3, 1, 12, 9>, <3, 1, 2, 6>, <3, 9, 14, 6>, <3, 9, 11, 5>, <3, 11, 5, 7>, <3, 11, 4, 1>, <3, 11, 9, 14>, <4, 1, 12, 7>, <4, 1, 3, 9>, <4, 5, 7, 12>, <4, 5, 11, 3>, <4, 11, 5, 7>, <4, 11, 3, 1>, <5, 4, 7, 12>, <5, 4, 11, 3>, <5, 7, 1, 12>, <5, 7, 4, 11>, <6, 8, 13, 10>, <6, 8, 13, 2>, <6, 8, 9, 3>, <6, 14, 9, 3>, <6, 14, 0, 7>, <6, 14, 2, 12>, <6, 14, 1, 2>, <7, 4, 1, 12>, <7, 4, 11, 5>, <7, 0, 14, 1>, <7, 0, 2, 12>, <8, 6, 14, 9, and 3>, <8, 6, 14, 0, and 7>, <8, 6, 2, 1, and 12>, etc.

Step 2: Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are <0, 7, 4, 1, (3, 9)>, <0, 7, 5, 11, (4, 1)>, <1, 4, 7, 12, (5, 11)>, <2, 1, 4, 7, (3, 9)>, <2, 1, 12, 10, (13, 6)>, <2, 1, 14, 6, (0, 12)>, <2, 6, 14, 0, (7, 12)>, <3, 1, 4, 7, (5, 11)>, <3, 1, 12, 9, (14, 6)>, <4, 1, 12, 7, (0, 5)>, <4, 5, 7, 12, (1, 11)>, <6, 8, 13, 10, (2, 9)>, and <6, 8, 13, 2, (12, 9)>.
