Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- (0, 5, 9, 1)
- (0, 5, 9, 8)
- (0, 5, 9, 7)
- (0, 5, 9, 2)
- (0, 5, 4, 9)
- (0, 5, 4, 0)
- (1, 9, 8, 3)
- (1, 9, 8, 0)
- (1, 9, 8, 3)
- (1, 9, 8, 9)
- (2, 9, 1, 7)
- (2, 9, 1, 0)
- (2, 9, 1, 2)
- (2, 9, 1, 9)
- (3, 8, 9, 5)
- (3, 8, 9, 4)
- (3, 8, 9, 7)
- (3, 8, 9, 2)
- (4, 5, 9, 1)
- (4, 5, 9, 7)
- (4, 5, 9, 2)
- (6, 5, 4, 9)
- (6, 5, 4, 0)
- (6, 3, 8, 9)
- (6, 3, 8, 3)
- (6, 3, 8, 9)
- (7, 1, 9, 8)
- (7, 1, 9, 3)
- (7, 1, 9, 7)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:
- <0, (5, 9), 1>
- <0, (5, 9), 8>
- <0, (5, 9), 7>
- <0, (5, 9), 2>
- <0, (5, 4), 9>
- <0, (5, 4), 0>
- <1, (9, 8), 3>
- <1, (9, 8), 0>
- <1, (9, 8), 3>
- <1, (9, 8), 9>
- <2, (9, 1), 7>
- <2, (9, 1), 0>
- <2, (9, 1), 2>
- <2, (9, 1), 9>
- <3, (8, 9), 5>
- <3, (8, 9), 4>
- <3, (8, 9), 7>
- <3, (8, 9), 2>
- <4, (5, 9), 1>
- <4, (5, 9), 7>
- <4, (5, 9), 2>
- <6, (5, 4), 9>
- <6, (5, 4), 0>
- <6, (3, 8), 9>
- <6, (3, 8), 3>
- <6, (3, 8), 9>
- <7, (1, 9), 8>
- <7, (1, 9), 3>
- <7, (1, 9), 7>

Step 3:
There are 28 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [28].
