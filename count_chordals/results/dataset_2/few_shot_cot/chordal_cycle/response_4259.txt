Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are four cycles of length 4 in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: 1-5-8-7-1 
- Cycle 2: 3-4-8-7-3 
- Cycle 3: 4-1-6-9-4 
- Cycle 4: 0-9-2-7-0

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, only Cycle 3 has exactly one chord, which is (1, 9).

Step 3:
As Cycle 3 is the only chordal 4-cycle found, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 9, 6, 4>.
