    - <7, (18, 8), 16>
    - <8, (10, 4), 13>
    - <8, (10, 4), 17>
    - <8, (18, 7), 17>
    - <9, (3, 15), 1>
    - <9, (3, 15), 11>

    - <16, (12, 13), 1>
    - <16, (12, 13), 7>
    - <19, (1, 13), 9>
    - <19, (1, 13), 4>
    - <19, (7, 18), 1>

Step 3: Counting chordless cycles:
- There are 25 chordal 4-cycles identified.
- Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles is [221].
