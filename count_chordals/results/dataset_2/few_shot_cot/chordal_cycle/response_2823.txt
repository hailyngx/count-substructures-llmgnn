Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 4, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 4, 6, 1, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 3, 8, 6, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 4, 5, 2, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 6, 7, 5, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 5, 7, 6, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 9, 8, 6, 3>
- Cycle 8: <4, 5, 7, 6, 4>
- Cycle 9: <6, 8, 4, 1, 6>
- Cycle 10: <7, 5, 4, 9, 7>

Step 2: Checking for one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (0, 5) and (9, 2)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (9, 1)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (4, 2)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (4, 1)
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (5, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [5] chordal 4-cycles in the graph. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 9, 4, 5> with chord (0, 5)
<0, 9, 3, 8> with chord (9, 1)
<1, 4, 5, 2> with chord (4, 2)
<1, 4, 6, 7> with chord (4, 7)
<6, 8, 4, 1> with chord (4, 1)
