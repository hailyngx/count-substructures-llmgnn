Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 6, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in this graph are as follows:
1. <0, 5, 4, 3, 1>
2. <0, 5, 6, 3, 1>
3. <1, 3, 4, 5, 9>
4. <1, 7, 6, 5, 9>
5. <1, 8, 4, 3, 2>
6. <2, 9, 5, 4, 0>
7. <2, 7, 6, 5, 9>
8. <3, 1, 2, 6, 7>
9. <3, 4, 8, 9, 5>
10. <4, 5, 6, 7, 3>
11. <4, 8, 9, 5, 6>
12. <5, 6, 7, 3, 1>
13. <6, 7, 2, 9, 5>
14. <8, 9, 5, 4, 0>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, we can identify the following chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, 5, 4, 3, 1> with chord (4, 1)
2. <0, 5, 6, 3, 1> with chord (6, 1)
3. <1, 3, 4, 5, 9> with chord (4, 9)
4. <1, 7, 6, 5, 9> with chord (6, 9)
5. <1, 8, 4, 3, 2> with chord (4, 2)
6. <2, 9, 5, 4, 0> with chord (5, 0)
7. <2, 7, 6, 5, 9> with chord (7, 9)
8. <3, 1, 2, 6, 7> with chord (2, 7)
9. <3, 4, 8, 9, 5> with chord (8, 5)
10. <4, 8, 9, 5, 6> with chord (9, 6)

Step 3:
As we have found 10 chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [10].
