- Cycle 35: (0, 8, 24, 17)  
- Cycle 36: (0, 8, 24, 16)  
- Cycle 37: (0, 8, 27, 1)  
- Cycle 38: (0, 1, 7, 10)  
- Cycle 39: (0, 1, 7, 29)  
- Cycle 40: (3, 22, 13, 16)  
- Cycle 41: (3, 22, 13, 21)  
- Cycle 42: (3, 22, 26, 9)  
- Cycle 43: (3, 6, 14, 17)  
- Cycle 44: (3, 6, 15, 8)

- Cycle 54: (25, 29, 20, 21)  
- Cycle 55: (25, 19, 11, 25)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).  
- Cycle 8: (13, 21, 4, 0) has a chord: (21, 0)  
- Cycle 22: (9, 26, 13, 16) has a chord: (26, 16)  
- Cycle 36: (0, 8, 24, 17) has a chord: (8, 17)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
There are 52 unique chordal 4-cycles found inside <>:
<1, (21, 0), 0>, <2, (26, 16), 9>, <3, (8, 17), 0>  

Putting this final number inside brackets gives [52].
