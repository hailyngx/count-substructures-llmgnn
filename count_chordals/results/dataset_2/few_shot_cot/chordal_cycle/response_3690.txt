Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- 4-cycle: <0, 6, 3, 9> with chord (0, 3)
- 4-cycle: <0, 6, 5, 7> with chord (0, 5)
- 4-cycle: <0, 6, 5, 9> with chord (0, 5)
- 4-cycle: <0, 6, 3, 7> with chord (0, 3)
- 4-cycle: <0, 2, 7, 5> with chord (0, 5)
- 4-cycle: <0, 2, 7, 3> with chord (0, 3)
- 4-cycle: <0, 2, 8, 4> with chord (0, 4)
- 4-cycle: <0, 2, 8, 9> with chord (0, 8)
- 4-cycle: <0, 7, 5, 9> with chord (0, 5)
- 4-cycle: <0, 7, 3, 9> with chord (0, 3)
- 4-cycle: <0, 7, 5, 6> with chord (0, 5)
- 4-cycle: <1, 9, 8, 4> with chord (1, 8)
- 4-cycle: <1, 9, 3, 7> with chord (1, 7)
- 4-cycle: <2, 8, 4, 9> with chord (2, 4)
- 4-cycle: <2, 8, 9, 5> with chord (2, 5)
- 4-cycle: <2, 8, 4, 3> with chord (2, 4)
- 4-cycle: <2, 1, 9, 5> with chord (2, 5)
- 4-cycle: <2, 1, 9, 3> with chord (2, 3)
- 4-cycle: <2, 1, 0, 6> with chord (2, 6)
- 4-cycle: <3, 9, 5, 7> with chord (3, 5)
- 4-cycle: <3, 9, 4, 8> with chord (3, 4)
- 4-cycle: <4, 5, 9, 3> with chord (4, 9)
- 4-cycle: <4, 5, 7, 3> with chord (4, 7)
- 4-cycle: <5, 9, 3, 6> with chord (5, 3)
- 4-cycle: <5, 9, 4, 8> with chord (5, 4)
- 4-cycle: <5, 9, 4, 3> with chord (5, 4)
- 4-cycle: <6, 5, 9, 1> with chord (6, 9)
- 4-cycle: <7, 5, 9, 1> with chord (7, 9)
- 4-cycle: <7, 5, 9, 3> with chord (7, 9)
- 4-cycle: <8, 9, 5, 7> with chord (8, 5)
- 4-cycle: <8, 9, 4, 3> with chord (8, 4)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we get [0] since all cycles have at least one chord.
