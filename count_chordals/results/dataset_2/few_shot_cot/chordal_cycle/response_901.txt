Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is:
<8, (6, 11), 18>

Following the steps outlined earlier:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle: 8 - 4 - 12 - 1 - 8
- Cycle: 8 - 4 - 12 - 1 - 15 - 16 - 14 - 10 - 17 - 0 - 16 - 1 - 12 - 4 
- Cycle: 8 - 18 - 5 - 9 - 13 - 14 - 10 - 17 - 11 - 18 - 8
- Cycle: 8 - 18 - 11 - 17 - 10 - 14 - 13 - 9 - 5 - 18

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle: 8 - 4 - 12 - 1 - 8 has no chord
- Cycle: 8 - 4 - 12 - 1 - 15 - 16 - 14 - 10 - 17 - 0 - 16 - 1 - 12 - 4 has no chord
- Cycle: 8 - 18 - 5 - 9 - 13 - 14 - 10 - 17 - 11 - 18 - 8 has no chord
- Cycle: 8 - 18 - 11 - 17 - 10 - 14 - 13 - 9 - 5 - 18 has exactly one chord (6, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
Since there is one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
