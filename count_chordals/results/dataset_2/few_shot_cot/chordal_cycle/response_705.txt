Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <1, 6, 16, 2, 11, 17, 8, 0, 1>
- Cycle 2: <3, 7, 5, 14, 3>
- Cycle 3: <4, 15, 14, 5, 10, 7, 3, 16, 6, 0, 13, 9, 12, 11, 17, 8, 0, 1, 7, 13, 3>
- Cycle 4: <19, 4, 15, 14, 5, 10, 7, 3, 16, 6, 0, 13, 9, 12, 11, 17, 18, 8, 0, 1, 7, 13, 19>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has a chord <3, 14>.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <3, 7, 5, 14, 3>
