Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <1, 4, 10, 4, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 13, 8, 2, 17, 7, 16, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 13, 8, 3, 14, 16, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 13, 8, 11, 12, 5, 3, 14, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 16, 7, 4, 10, 4, 15, 6, 19, 18, 13, 1>
- Cycle 6: <15, 4, 10, 4, 7, 16, 1, 0, 18, 19, 6, 15>
- Cycle 7: <15, 4, 10, 4, 7, 19, 18, 16, 14, 3, 5, 12, 11, 8, 13, 1, 0, 6, 15>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (4, 1)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (1, 16)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (8, 3)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (8, 3)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (13, 18)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (15, 6)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (15, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, 4, 10, 4, 1> (Chord: (4, 1))
2. <1, 13, 8, 3, 14, 16, 1> (Chord: (8, 3))
3. <1, 13, 8, 11, 12, 5, 3, 14, 1> (Chord: (8, 3))
4. <15, 4, 10, 4, 7, 16, 1, 0, 18, 19, 6, 15> (Chord: (15, 6))
