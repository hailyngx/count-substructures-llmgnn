Step 2:  
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:  
- <3, 15, 10, 1> has a chord (3, 1)  
- <3, 15, 17, 12> has a chord (15, 12)  
- <3, 15, 19, 11> has a chord (15, 11)  
- <3, 0, 7, 17> has a chord (17, 0)  
- <3, 6, 13, 10> has a chord (6, 10)  
- <3, 12, 17, 7> has a chord (12, 7)  
- <3, 12, 2, 13> has a chord (12, 13)  
- <6, 13, 10, 15> has a chord (13, 15)  
- <15, 10, 19, 11> has a chord (10, 19)  
- <16, 0, 3, 12> has a chord (0, 12)  
- <18, 1, 3, 15> has a chord (1, 3)  
- <18, 8, 5, 11> has a chord (8, 11)  
- <19, 0, 3, 12> has a chord (0, 12)  
- <19, 11, 5, 8> has a chord (11, 8)  

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have found 14 chordal 4-cycles.  
So, the final answer is [14].
