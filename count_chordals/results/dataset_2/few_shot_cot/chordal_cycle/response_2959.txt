Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 16, 2, 13, 19> of length 4
- Cycle <4, 11, 16, 0, 4> of length 4
- Cycle <4, 11, 5, 19, 13, 6, 1, 15, 4> of length 8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 16, 2, 13, 19> has one chord (16, 13)
- Cycle <4, 11, 16, 0, 4> has one chord (11, 0)
- Cycle <4, 11, 5, 19, 13, 6, 1, 15, 4> has one chord (11, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:
There are no chordless cycles found. 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
