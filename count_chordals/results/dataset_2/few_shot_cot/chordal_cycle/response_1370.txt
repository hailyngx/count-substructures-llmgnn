Response:
Step 1: 
We can identify the cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 1, 8, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 7, 2, 8, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 12, 9, 1, 5>
- Cycle 4: <4, 11, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle 5: <4, 13, 2, 14, 4>
- Cycle 6: <2, 13, 4, 8, 2>
- Cycle 7: <7, 5, 8, 2, 7>
- Cycle 8: <7, 11, 4, 13, 7>
- Cycle 9: <10, 11, 6, 12, 10>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 2 has chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 3 has chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 4 has chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 5 has chord (2, 4)
- Cycle 6 has chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 7 has chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 8 has chord (4, 11)
- Cycle 9 has no chord

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have:
- One chordless cycle: Cycle 9

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <10, 11, 6, 12>.
