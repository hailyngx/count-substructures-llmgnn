Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 0, 9, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 1, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 1, 6, 7, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 1, 3, 4, 5>
- Cycle 5: <9, 3, 4, 7, 9>
- Cycle 6: <9, 3, 1, 6, 9>
- Cycle 7: <0, 9, 7, 8, 0>
- Cycle 8: <0, 9, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 9: <0, 9, 3, 1, 0>
- Cycle 10: <4, 5, 1, 3, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 5, 7, 6, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 5, 1, 6, 4>
- Cycle 13: <7, 4, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 14: <7, 4, 1, 3, 7>
- Cycle 15: <7, 4, 5, 1, 7>
- Cycle 16: <6, 5, 2, 0, 6>
- Cycle 17: <6, 5, 1, 4, 6>
- Cycle 18: <6, 5, 1, 3, 6>
- Cycle 19: <2, 5, 1, 3, 2>
- Cycle 20: <8, 5, 1, 6, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (3, 7)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (3, 1)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 11 has a chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 12 has a chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 13 has a chord (4, 1)
- Cycle 14 has a chord (4, 3)
- Cycle 15 has a chord (4, 1)
- Cycle 16 has a chord (5, 0)
- Cycle 17 has a chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 18 has a chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 19 has a chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 20 has a chord (5, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [0].
