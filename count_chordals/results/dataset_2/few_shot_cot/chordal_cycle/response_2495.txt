Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <10, 0, 6, 8, 10>
        - Cycle 2: <10, 1, 7, 12, 10>
        - Cycle 3: <10, 11, 3, 13, 10>
        - Cycle 4: <10, 11, 14, 8, 10>
        - Cycle 5: <11, 3, 2, 5, 11>
        - Cycle 6: <11, 14, 8, 5, 11>
        - Cycle 7: <11, 14, 8, 2, 11>
        - Cycle 8: <11, 14, 8, 0, 10>
        - Cycle 9: <3, 13, 9, 4, 3>
        - Cycle 10: <4, 2, 3, 13, 4>
        - Cycle 11: <4, 9, 12, 7, 4>
        - Cycle 12: <5, 13, 9, 4, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Cycle 1 has a chord: <10, 0, 6, 8, 10> with chord (6, 8).
        - Cycle 2 has a chord: <10, 1, 7, 12, 10> with chord (1, 7).
        - Cycle 3 has a chord: <10, 11, 3, 13, 10> with chord (11, 13).
        - Cycle 4 has a chord: <10, 11, 14, 8, 10> with chord (11, 14).
        - Cycle 9 has a chord: <3, 13, 9, 4, 3> with chord (13, 9).
        - Cycle 10 has a chord: <4, 2, 3, 13, 4> with chord (3, 13).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found.

Put the final count inside brackets: [6].
