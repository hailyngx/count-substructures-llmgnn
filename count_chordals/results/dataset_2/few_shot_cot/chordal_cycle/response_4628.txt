Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 13) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 12) (10, 13) (10, 9) (10, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 2) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 9) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 6) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 12) (14, 3) (14, 6) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 0) (12, 9) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles with at least 4 nodes in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-3-0-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-10-13-1
- Cycle 3: 1-10-12-9-13-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Out of the cycles listed above, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Chord (0, 1) in cycle 1-3-0-4-1  -> Chordal 4-cycle <1, (0, 1), 3, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As there is only one chordal 4-cycle identified, the final answer is [1].
