Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- <0, 5, 1, 4>
- <0, 5, 8, 12>
- <0, 5, 10, 11>
- <0, 3, 9, 4>
- <0, 3, 13, 2>
- <0, 7, 4, 10>
- <0, 7, 2, 13>
- <1, 5, 8, 14>
- <1, 4, 9, 3>
- <1, 4, 10, 5>
- <2, 9, 4, 7>
- <2, 9, 3, 13>
- <2, 11, 10, 4>
- <2, 11, 14, 12>
- <2, 7, 4, 9>
- <2, 7, 13, 5>
- <2, 0, 5, 13>
- <3, 9, 4, 1>
- <3, 9, 2, 13>
- <4, 9, 2, 6>
- <4, 9, 3, 1>
- <4, 10, 5, 13>
- <5, 13, 7, 4>
- <5, 8, 6, 2>
- <7, 4, 9, 2>
- <7, 4, 1, 5>
- <7, 12, 14, 11>
- <7, 12, 8, 5>
- <8, 5, 10, 4>
- <8, 14, 11, 2>
- <9, 3, 13, 7>
- <11, 2, 7, 13>
- <13, 7, 12, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <0, 5, 1, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 33 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [33].
