Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 9, 7, 4) with edges (5, 6), (6, 9), (9, 7), (7, 4), and (4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 6, 2, 3) with edges (1, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (2, 3), and (3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (0, 9, 8, 2, 6) with edges (0, 9), (9, 8), (8, 2), (2, 6), and (6, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 9, 7, 4, 8) with edges (0, 9), (9, 7), (7, 4), (4, 8), and (8, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 9, 6, 5, 1) with edges (0, 9), (9, 6), (6, 5), (5, 1), and (1, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 4, 7, 9, 6) with edges (0, 4), (4, 7), (7, 9), (9, 6), and (6, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 4, 8, 7, 9) with edges (0, 4), (4, 8), (8, 7), (7, 9), and (9, 0)
- Cycle 8: (0, 8, 2, 6, 5) with edges (0, 8), (8, 2), (2, 6), (6, 5), and (5, 0)
- Cycle 9: (1, 2, 8, 9, 7) with edges (1, 2), (2, 8), (8, 9), (9, 7), and (7, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 3, 2, 8, 0) with edges (1, 3), (3, 2), (2, 8), (8, 0), and (0, 1)
- Cycle 11: (2, 3, 5, 6, 1) with edges (2, 3), (3, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1), and (1, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 1: (5, 6, 9, 7, 4) with the chord (6, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 10 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [10].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (6, 4), 5>.
