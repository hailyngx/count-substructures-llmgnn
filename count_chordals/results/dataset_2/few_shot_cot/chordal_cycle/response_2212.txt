Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 5, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 3, 1, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 6, 4, 0)
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 5, 3, 6, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 7, 4, 6, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 7, 6, 4, 1)
- Cycle 8: (3, 5, 4, 7, 3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 5, 6, 4, 3)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: <(0, 5)>
- Cycle 2 has no chords 
- Cycle 3 has no chords 
- Cycle 4 has no chords 
- Cycle 5 has no chords 
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: <(4, 6)>
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord: <(1, 7)>
- Cycle 8 has no chords 
- Cycle 9 has no chords 

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 5, 3, 1>
<0, (4, 6), 5, 3, 1>
<1, (7, 1), 4, 6>
<3, 5, 4, 7>
