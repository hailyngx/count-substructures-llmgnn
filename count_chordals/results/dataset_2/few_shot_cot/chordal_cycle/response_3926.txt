Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
1. <0, 7, 9, 3, 1> 
2. <0, 7, 9, 6, 3> 
3. <0, 7, 9, 6, 14> 
4. <0, 7, 4, 12, 5> 
5. <1, 11, 2, 8, 2>
6. <2, 11, 1, 0, 7>
7. <3, 1, 0, 7, 15>
8. <3, 1, 11, 14, 6>
9. <3, 1, 11, 2, 8> 

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
1. <3, 1, 11, 14, 6> with non-adjacent nodes 1 and 14 connected by chord 11

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
