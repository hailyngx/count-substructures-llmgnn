Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 22, 17, 5>

8. <1, 10, 4, 8>
9. <1, 10, 25, 21>
10. <1, 9, 19, 22>
11. <2, 25, 21, 27>
12. <2, 19, 10, 4>

45. <20, 1, 9, 19>
46. <20, 12, 24, 13>
47. <21, 15, 1, 9>
48. <21, 25, 10, 4>
49. <22, 0, 14, 6>
50. <23, 0, 13, 24>

52. <25, 21, 15, 1>
53. <25, 2, 7, 5>
54. <27, 21, 15, 13>
55. <28, 11, 8, 24>
56. <29, 7, 5, 17>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, 22, 17, 5, (22, 17)>
2. <1, 20, 18, 11, (20, 11)>
3. <2, 19, 10, 4, (19, 4)>
4. <5, 17, 22, 18, (17, 18)>
5. <7, 5, 17, 22, (5, 22)>
6. <8, 4, 10, 1, (4, 1)>
7. <10, 19, 13, 0, (19, 13)>
8. <15, 1, 10, 25, (1, 10)>
9. <16, 29, 23, 0, (29, 23)>
10. <18, 11, 8, 4, (11, 8)>
11. <19, 9, 1, 10, (9, 10)>
12. <20, 12, 24, 13, (12, 24)>
13. <21, 25, 10, 4, (25, 10)>
14. <27, 21, 15, 13, (21, 15)>
15. <28, 11, 8, 24, (11, 24)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 56 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [56].
