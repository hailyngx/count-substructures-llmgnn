Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. Cycle: 0-5-8-1-0
2. Cycle: 0-6-4-8-0
3. Cycle: 0-7-8-4-0
4. Cycle: 0-9-4-1-0
5. Cycle: 1-3-8-4-1
6. Cycle: 2-9-4-1-2
7. Cycle: 2-3-1-4-2
8. Cycle: 3-1-4-9-3
9. Cycle: 4-9-3-1-4
10. Cycle: 5-6-4-8-5
11. Cycle: 6-4-8-5-6
12. Cycle: 8-5-0-7-8
13. Cycle: 8-6-0-7-8
14. Cycle: 8-7-0-5-8
15. Cycle: 9-4-1-3-9

Step 2:
Among these cycles, we can identify the following chordal 4-cycles:
1. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (5, 8), 1>
2. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (6, 4), 8>
3. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (7, 8), 4>
4. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (9, 4), 1>
5. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (3, 8), 4>
6. Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (9, 4), 1>
7. Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (3, 1), 4>
8. Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (1, 4), 9>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [7].

Final answer: [7]
