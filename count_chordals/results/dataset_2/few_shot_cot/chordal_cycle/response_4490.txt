Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 8, 11, 5, 6, 0>
2. <0, 8, 11, 13, 3, 0>
3. <0, 8, 11, 4, 12, 0>
4. <0, 6, 5, 11, 13, 0>
5. <0, 6, 11, 4, 12, 0>
6. <0, 2, 9, 13, 3, 0>
7. <0, 2, 10, 6, 5, 0>
8. <0, 2, 10, 4, 12, 0>
9. <1, 8, 11, 5, 6, 1>
10. <1, 12, 4, 11, 5, 1>
11. <1, 12, 4, 6, 0, 1>
12. <1, 14, 2, 10, 6, 1>
13. <1, 14, 2, 9, 8, 1>
14. <2, 7, 5, 6, 0, 2>
15. <2, 7, 5, 11, 13, 2>
16. <2, 9, 13, 11, 5, 2>
17. <2, 9, 8, 11, 6, 2>
18. <2, 10, 6, 5, 0, 2>
19. <2, 10, 4, 12, 0, 2>
20. <3, 13, 11, 8, 0, 3>
21. <4, 12, 14, 1, 8, 4>
22. <4, 12, 14, 2, 10, 4>
23. <4, 11, 5, 7, 2, 4>
24. <5, 6, 10, 6>
25. <5, 11, 13, 3, 0, 6>
26. <6, 10, 2, 7, 5, 6>
27. <6, 11, 4, 12, 0, 6>
28. <8, 11, 5, 6, 10, 8>
29. <8, 11, 13, 3, 0, 8>
30. <9, 13, 11, 5, 6, 9>
31. <9, 13, 3, 0, 2, 9>
32. <10, 6, 5, 11, 13, 10>
33. <10, 4, 12, 14, 1, 10>
34. <11, 13, 9, 8, 0, 11>
35. <12, 4, 11, 5, 7, 12>
36. <12, 14, 2, 9, 13, 12>
37. <13, 11, 8, 0, 6, 13>
38. <14, 12, 4, 11, 5, 14>

Step 2:
Based on the cycles listed, there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle, which is:
<0, 8, 11, 5, 6, 0> with chord (13, 3)

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [0].
