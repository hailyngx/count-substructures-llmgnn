Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 7, 2, 17>
- <0, 7, 18, 5>
- <0, 7, 2, 8>
- <0, 4, 12, 1>
- <0, 4, 12, 11>
- <0, 15, 10, 6>
- <0, 15, 10, 16>
- <0, 15, 6, 13>
- <0, 18, 7, 2>
- <0, 18, 7, 9>
- <0, 18, 5, 19>
- <1, 8, 2, 17>
- <1, 8, 2, 19>
- <1, 8, 13, 9>
- <1, 12, 4, 0>
- <1, 12, 4, 12>
- <1, 12, 11, 5>
- <2, 17, 8, 13>
- <2, 17, 8, 1>
- <2, 17, 8, 7>
- <2, 19, 5, 11>
- <2, 19, 5, 18>
- <2, 19, 18, 5>
- <2, 7, 18, 5>
- <3, 9, 7, 2>
- <4, 0, 7, 18>
- <4, 0, 7, 2>
- <4, 12, 11, 5>
- <5, 11, 12, 4>
- <5, 11, 12, 1>
- <5, 18, 7, 0>
- <5, 18, 7, 2>
- <5, 18, 0, 15>
- <6, 13, 8, 17>
- <6, 13, 9, 14>
- <6, 13, 9, 3>
- <6, 15, 0, 4>
- <7, 2, 8, 1>
- <7, 2, 17, 14>
- <7, 18, 5, 11>
- <9, 14, 1, 12>
- <9, 14, 1, 8>
- <9, 14, 17, 2>
- <9, 7, 0, 15>
- <9, 7, 0, 4>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, 8, 2, 17> with chord (8, 13)
- <1, 8, 13, 9> with chord (8, 13)
- <1, 12, 4, 0> with chord (4, 12)
- <1, 12, 11, 5> with chord (12, 11)
- <2, 17, 8, 13> with chord (17, 8)
- <2, 19, 5, 11> with chord (19, 5)
- <3, 9, 7, 2> with chord (9, 7)

Step 3:
There are a total of [7] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
