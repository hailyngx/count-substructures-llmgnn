Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, and node 2

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3

Response:
Following the steps provided:

Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 1, 4, 8, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 1, 9, 3, 6, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 6, 5, 8, 4, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 5: <4, 8, 5, 6, 3, 9, 1, 7, 4>
- Cycle 6: <5, 7, 0, 3, 9, 1, 4, 8, 5>
- Cycle 7: <6, 3, 0, 7, 1, 4, 8, 5, 6>
- Cycle 8: <7, 1, 4, 8, 5, 6, 3, 9, 7>
- Cycle 9: <8, 4, 1, 9, 3, 0, 7, 5, 8>
- Cycle 10: <9, 1, 4, 8, 5, 6, 3, 0, 7, 9>

Step 2: Checking for one chord in each cycle:
- <0, (7, 1), 4, 8, 5, 2, 0>
- <0, (7, 1), 9, 3, 6, 2, 0>
- <0, 3, 6, 5, 8, 4, 1, (7, 0), 3>
- <1, (4, 7), 0, 3, 6, 2, 5, 8, 1>
- <4, 8, 5, (6, 3), 9, 1, 7, 4>
- <5, 7, 0, 3, 9, 1, 4, (8, 5)>
- <6, 3, 0, 7, 1, 4, 8, (5, 6), 3>
- <7, 1, 4, 8, (5, 6), 3, 9, 7>
- <8, 4, 1, 9, 3, 0, 7, (5, 8), 8>
- <9, 1, 4, 8, (5, 6), 3, 0, 7, 9>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles:
There are <6, 3, 0, 7, 1, 4, 8, 5, 6> and <7, 1, 4, 8, 5, 6, 3, 9, 7> as the unique chordless 4-cycles.
So, the final count is [2].
