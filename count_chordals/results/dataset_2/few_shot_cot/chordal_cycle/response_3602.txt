Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 7, 3, 5>
2. <0, 7, 3, 9>
3. <0, 7, 5, 8>
4. <0, 6, 1, 5>
5. <0, 6, 1, 2>
6. <0, 6, 2, 8>
7. <1, 5, 9, 2>
8. <1, 5, 3, 4>
9. <1, 6, 2, 8>
10. <1, 6, 8, 5>
11. <2, 9, 5, 8>
12. <2, 9, 3, 7>
13. <2, 6, 8, 5>
14. <2, 6, 1, 5>
15. <3, 5, 7, 0>
16. <3, 5, 9, 2>
17. <3, 5, 9, 4>
18. <3, 9, 2, 6>
19. <4, 9, 2, 6>
20. <5, 9, 4, 3>
21. <5, 9, 2, 8>
22. <5, 9, 3, 7>
23. <5, 8, 2, 6>
24. <5, 8, 6, 1>
25. <6, 0, 7, 5>
26. <6, 0, 7, 9>
27. <6, 1, 5, 9>
28. <6, 1, 2, 8>
29. <7, 0, 6, 1>
30. <7, 0, 6, 2>
31. <7, 5, 9, 2>
32. <7, 5, 8, 6>
33. <8, 5, 1, 6>
34. <8, 5, 9, 2>
35. <8, 5, 6, 0>
36. <8, 2, 1, 6>
37. <9, 5, 8, 6>
38. <9, 5, 7, 0>
39. <9, 5, 1, 6>
40. <9, 4, 3, 7>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (forming a chordal 4-cycle) are:
1. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 6, 1, 5>, Chord: (1, 6)
2. Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 9, 2, 6>, Chord: (2, 9)
3. Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 9, 2, 6>, Chord: (2, 9)
4. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 8, 2, 6>, Chord: (2, 8)
5. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 8, 6, 1>, Chord: (1, 5)
6. Chordal 4-cycle: <8, 5, 1, 6>, Chord: (1, 6)
7. Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 4, 3, 7>, Chord: (4, 9)

Step 3:
There are a total of [7] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
