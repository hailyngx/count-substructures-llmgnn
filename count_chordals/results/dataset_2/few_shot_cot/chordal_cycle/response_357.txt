Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 9, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 6, 9, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 6, 9, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 5, 4, 7, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 0, 3, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 3, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle 10: <3, 7, 4, 1, 3>
- Cycle 11: <3, 7, 9, 6, 3>
- Cycle 12: <3, 9, 6, 1, 3>
- Cycle 13: <3, 9, 2, 5, 3>
- Cycle 14: <4, 7, 3, 9, 4>
- Cycle 15: <4, 1, 6, 9, 4>
- Cycle 16: <5, 4, 1, 6, 5>
- Cycle 17: <5, 2, 9, 3, 5>
- Cycle 18: <6, 4, 7, 3, 6>
- Cycle 19: <7, 3, 9, 6, 7>

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- <2, (5, 4), 7>
- <3, (9, 6), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are 17 chordless cycles, so the final count is [17].
