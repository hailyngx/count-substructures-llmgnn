Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
1. Cycle: (9, 22, 10, 12, 9)
2. Cycle: (9, 22, 10, 15, 9)
3. Cycle: (9, 22, 10, 13, 9)
4. Cycle: (9, 22, 10, 12, 26, 6, 15, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycle:
<1, (12, 18), 13)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is a total of [3] chordless 4-cycles.
