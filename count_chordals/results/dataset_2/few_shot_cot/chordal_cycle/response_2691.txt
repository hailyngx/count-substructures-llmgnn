- <0, 12, 16, 18>
- <0, 5, 17, 5>
- <1, 14, 12, 0>
- <2, 18, 14, 5>
- <3, 16, 18, 2>
- <3, 16, 12, 14>
- <3, 11, 15, 6>
- <3, 11, 10, 11>
- <4, 7, 8, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 15, 6> has chord (5, 15)
- <0, 5, 14, 1> has chord (5, 14)
- <0, 12, 14, 1> has chord (12, 14)
- <0, 5, 17, 5> has chord (5, 17)
- <1, 14, 12, 0> has chord (14, 12)
- <3, 11, 15, 6> has chord (11, 15)
- <4, 7, 13, 6> has chord (7, 13)
- <4, 19, 9, 0> has chord (19, 9)
- <7, 13, 6, 15> has chord (13, 6)
- <8, 19, 9, 0> has chord (19, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
