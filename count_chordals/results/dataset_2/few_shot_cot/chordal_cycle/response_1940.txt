Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one non-adjacent edge (chord):
- <0, 13, 2, 11> - Chord is (13, 2)
- <0, 13, 7, 5> - Chord is (13, 7)
- <0, 13, 1, 9> - Chord is (13, 1)
- <0, 12, 14, 8> - Chord is (12, 8)
- <0, 12, 10, 6> - Chord is (12, 6)
- <0, 3, 4, 14> - Chord is (3, 4)
- <0, 3, 8, 1> - Chord is (3, 8)
- <0, 3, 10, 6> - Chord is (3, 10)
- <1, 9, 6, 4> - Chord is (9, 4)
- <1, 9, 7, 5> - Chord is (9, 5)
- <1, 9, 6, 10> - Chord is (9, 10)
- <1, 13, 2, 3> - Chord is (13, 2)
- <1, 13, 7, 5> - Chord is (13, 7)
- <1, 13, 0, 12> - Chord is (13, 12)
- <2, 9, 6, 10> - Chord is (9, 10)
- <2, 9, 1, 13> - Chord is (9, 13)
- <2, 9, 7, 5> - Chord is (9, 5)
- <2, 9, 13, 0> - Chord is (9, 0)
- <3, 4, 6, 10> - Chord is (4, 10)
- <3, 8, 1, 9> - Chord is (8, 9)
- <3, 10, 6, 4> - Chord is (10, 4)
- <4, 6, 10, 12> - Chord is (6, 12)
- <4, 6, 9, 7> - Chord is (6, 7)
- <5, 7, 14, 8> - Chord is (7, 14)
- <6, 9, 7, 5> - Chord is (9, 5)
- <7, 9, 13, 2> - Chord is (9, 13)
- <8, 14, 12, 0> - Chord is (14, 0)
