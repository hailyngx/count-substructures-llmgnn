- <7, 4, 14, 1> (Chord: (7, 14))
- <23, 9, 14, 4> (Chord: (23, 14))
- <0, 20, 2, 29> (Chord: (0, 2))
- <20, 2, 18, 5> (Chord: (20, 18))
- <1, 20, 2, 29> (Chord: (1, 2))
- <13, 3, 9, 23> (Chord: (13, 9))
- <25, 8, 10, 16> (Chord: (25, 10))
- <27, 1, 20, 2> (Chord: (27, 20))

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [12].
