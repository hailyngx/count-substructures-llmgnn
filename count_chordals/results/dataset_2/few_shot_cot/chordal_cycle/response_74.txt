Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <1, 4, 11, 10>
- Cycle 2: <1, 8, 14, 7>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 13, 5>
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, 6, 5>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 5, 10>
- Cycle 6: <3, 11, 4, 13>
- Cycle 7: <3, 9, 2, 6>
- Cycle 8: <3, 12, 8, 14>
- Cycle 9: <10, 7, 14, 8>
- Cycle 10: <10, 5, 14, 6>
- Cycle 11: <11, 4, 2, 6>
- Cycle 12: <11, 3, 9, 2>
- Cycle 13: <4, 13, 5, 6>
- Cycle 14: <4, 5, 7, 10>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, 4, 11, 10> - chord: (4, 10)
- Cycle 2: <1, 8, 14, 7> - chord: (8, 14)
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 13, 5> - chord: (4, 5)
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, 6, 5> - chord: (2, 6)
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 5, 10> - chord: (4, 5)
- Cycle 6: <3, 11, 4, 13> - chord: (11, 13)
- Cycle 7: <3, 9, 2, 6> - chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 8: <3, 12, 8, 14> - chord: (12, 8)
- Cycle 9: <10, 7, 14, 8> - chord: (7, 14)
- Cycle 10: <10, 5, 14, 6> - chord: (5, 14)
- Cycle 11: <11, 4, 2, 6> - chord: (4, 2)
- Cycle 12: <11, 3, 9, 2> - chord: (3, 9)
- Cycle 13: <4, 13, 5, 6> - chord: (13, 5)
- Cycle 14: <4, 5, 7, 10> - chord: (5, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
