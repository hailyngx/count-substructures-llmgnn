Response:
Since the graph has 30 nodes and 90 edges, it is not feasible to list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph due to the large number of possible combinations. Instead, we will directly look for chordal 4-cycles.

Let's first identify the chordal 4-cycles in the graph:

1. Potential chordal 4-cycle: <14, 0, 12, 18>
   - Chord: (0, 12)

2. Potential chordal 4-cycle: <17, 12, 18, 25>
   - Chord: (12, 18)

3. Potential chordal 4-cycle: <2, 8, 5, 18>
   - Chord: (8, 18)

4. Potential chordal 4-cycle: <16, 14, 19, 21>
   - Chord: (14, 19)

5. Potential chordal 4-cycle: <6, 11, 20, 24>
   - Chord: (11, 20)

Now, we count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, all identified cycles have a chord, so there are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
