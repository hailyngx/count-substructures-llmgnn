Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 12, 5, 2>
- <0, 6, 14, 13>
- <1, 3, 10, 13>
- <1, 7, 11, 2>
- <2, 5, 12, 4>
- <6, 10, 9, 2>
- <8, 3, 12, 5>
- <8, 9, 2, 7>
- <13, 1, 7, 11>
- <13, 8, 11, 5>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <0, 12, 5, 2>, with the chord (12, 5).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [9]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 12, 5, 2>.
