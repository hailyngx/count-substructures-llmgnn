Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- The unique cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
    - <0, 4, 7, 8>
    - <0, 8, 6, 5>
    - <1, 5, 7, 4>
    - <1, 3, 7, 5>
    - <1, 4, 7, 5>
    - <2, 5, 6, 7>
    - <3, 1, 4, 7>
    - <3, 1, 5, 7>
    - <3, 2, 6, 5>
    - <4, 1, 5, 7>
    - <4, 1, 3, 7>
    - <5, 9, 0, 8>
    - <5, 9, 0, 4>
    - <6, 5, 7, 3>
    - <6, 5, 9, 0>
    - <7, 5, 1, 3>
    - <7, 5, 9, 0>
    - <8, 0, 9, 5>
    - <8, 0, 9, 6>

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following chordal 4-cycles:
    - <0, 4, 7, 8> (chord: (4, 8))
    - <0, 8, 6, 5> (chord: (6, 8))
    - <1, 5, 7, 4> (chord: (5, 7))
    - <1, 3, 7, 5> (chord: (3, 7))
    - <1, 4, 7, 5> (chord: (4, 7))
    - <2, 5, 6, 7> (chord: (5, 6))
    - <3, 1, 4, 7> (chord: (1, 4))
    - <3, 1, 5, 7> (chord: (1, 5))
    - <3, 2, 6, 5> (chord: (2, 6))
    - <4, 1, 5, 7> (chord: (1, 5))
    - <4, 1, 3, 7> (chord: (1, 3))
    - <5, 9, 0, 8> (chord: (0, 9))
    - <5, 9, 0, 4> (chord: (0, 9))
    - <6, 5, 7, 3> (chord: (5, 7))
    - <6, 5, 9, 0> (chord: (5, 9))
    - <7, 5, 1, 3> (chord: (1, 3))
    - <7, 5, 9, 0> (chord: (5, 9))
    - <8, 0, 9, 5> (chord: (0, 9))
    - <8, 0, 9, 6> (chord: (0, 9))

Step 3: 
- Counting the number of chordal cycles found, we have [18].
