Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle: <0, 20, 27, 1, 7>
- Cycle: <0, 7, 15, 29, 2>
- Cycle: <2, 5, 13, 27, 1>
- Cycle: <2, 29, 15, 7, 1>
- Cycle: <2, 29, 18, 25, 14>
- Cycle: <5, 13, 24, 8, 1>
- Cycle: <6, 3, 2, 29, 15>
- Cycle: <6, 3, 19, 27, 1>
- Cycle: <7, 1, 26, 21, 8>
- Cycle: <7, 27, 19, 12, 3>
- Cycle: <8, 21, 28, 16, 0>
- Cycle: <9, 23, 0, 7, 1>
- Cycle: <10, 17, 23, 9, 13>
- Cycle: <11, 18, 21, 8, 24>
- Cycle: <13, 5, 2, 3, 6>
- Cycle: <13, 9, 23, 0, 16>
- Cycle: <15, 29, 25, 14, 25>
- Cycle: <16, 0, 20, 27, 19>
- Cycle: <18, 29, 22, 15, 7>
- Cycle: <22, 10, 17, 23, 9>
- Cycle: <25, 29, 15, 7, 0>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

From the listed cycles, the cycle <0, 20, 27, 1, 7> has exactly one chord: (1, 27).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

There is 20 chordless 4-cycles in the graph.

Final answer: [20]
