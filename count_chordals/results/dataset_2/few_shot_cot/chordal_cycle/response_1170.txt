Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 12, 15>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 8, 18>
- Cycle 3: <0, 18, 16, 12>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 15, 2>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 13, 16>
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 4, 8>
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 19, 14>
- Cycle 8: <2, 9, 14, 19>
- Cycle 9: <2, 15, 10, 11>
- Cycle 10: <2, 17, 12, 16>
- Cycle 11: <3, 0, 4, 6>
- Cycle 12: <3, 5, 15, 10>
- Cycle 13: <3, 12, 17, 2>
- Cycle 14: <4, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 15: <4, 8, 18, 14>
- Cycle 16: <4, 12, 16, 13>
- Cycle 17: <5, 13, 16, 18>
- Cycle 18: <9, 11, 10, 15>
- Cycle 19: <9, 14, 19, 6>

Step 2: Check for one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 12, 15> has the chord (4, 12)
- <0, 4, 8, 18> has the chord (4, 18)
- <0, 18, 16, 12> has the chord (18, 16)
- <1, 5, 15, 2> has the chord (5, 15)
- <1, 5, 13, 16> has the chord (5, 13)
- <1, 6, 4, 8> has the chord (6, 8)
- <1, 6, 19, 14> has the chord (6, 19)
- <2, 9, 14, 19> has the chord (9, 14)
- <2, 15, 10, 11> has the chord (15, 10)
- <2, 17, 12, 16> has the chord (17, 12)
- <4, 6, 1, 5> has the chord (6, 1)
- <4, 8, 18, 14> has the chord (8, 14)
- <4, 12, 16, 13> has the chord (12, 16)
- <5, 13, 16, 18> has the chord (13, 16)
- <9, 11, 10, 15> has the chord (11, 10)
- <9, 14, 19, 6> has the chord (14, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [16].
