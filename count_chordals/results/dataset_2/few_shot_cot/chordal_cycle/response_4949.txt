Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2)

Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- <0, 1, 3, 2, 4, 9, 6, 0>
- <0, 4, 9, 6, 5, 8, 2, 7, 1, 0>
- <0, 4, 1, 7, 2, 8, 5, 6, 9, 0>
- <1, 3, 9, 6, 5, 8, 2, 7, 1>
- <1, 4, 9, 6, 5, 8, 2, 3, 1>
- <1, 4, 8, 2, 7, 1, 0, 6, 9, 3>
- <2, 3, 9, 6, 5, 8, 4, 1, 7, 2>
- <2, 4, 9, 6, 5, 8, 3, 1, 7, 2>
- <4, 9, 3, 1, 7, 2, 8, 5, 6, 0>
- <4, 9, 3, 2, 8, 5, 6, 0, 1, 7>
- <5, 6, 9, 3, 1, 7, 2, 8, 4, 5>
- <5, 6, 9, 3, 2, 8, 4, 5>
- <6, 9, 3, 1, 7, 2, 8, 5>
- <6, 9, 3, 2, 8, 5>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- The number of chordless cycles found is [14].
