Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 9, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 5, 3, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 4, 7, 3, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 4, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 4, 8, 9, 0>
- Cycle 8: <0, 6, 4, 5, 0>
- Cycle 9: <0, 6, 8, 9, 0>
- Cycle 10: <0, 7, 4, 5, 0>
- Cycle 11: <1, 9, 5, 4, 1>
- Cycle 12: <1, 9, 5, 0, 1>
- Cycle 13: <1, 9, 8, 4, 1>
- Cycle 14: <2, 5, 9, 1, 2>
- Cycle 15: <2, 5, 9, 8, 2>
- Cycle 16: <2, 3, 5, 4, 2>
- Cycle 17: <3, 7, 4, 5, 3>
- Cycle 18: <3, 7, 4, 0, 3>
- Cycle 19: <3, 7, 0, 5, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 5, 0>, Chord: (4, 7)
    
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 18 chordless 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [18].
