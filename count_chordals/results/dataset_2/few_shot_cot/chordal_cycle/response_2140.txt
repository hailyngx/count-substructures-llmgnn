Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <3, 15, 1, 7>
- Cycle 2: <4, 7, 0, 16>
- Cycle 3: <4, 13, 2, 10>
- Cycle 4: <4, 13, 6, 9>
- Cycle 5: <16, 14, 11, 0>
- Cycle 6: <18, 17, 8, 0>
- Cycle 7: <18, 17, 15, 3>
- Cycle 8: <18, 5, 3, 15>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <3, (1, 15), 7>: Chord (1, 15) in cycle <3, 15, 1, 7>
- <4, (0, 16), 7>: Chord (0, 16) in cycle <4, 7, 0, 16>
- <4, (2, 10), 13>: Chord (2, 10) in cycle <4, 13, 2, 10>
- <4, (6, 9), 13>: Chord (6, 9) in cycle <4, 13, 6, 9>
- <16, (0, 11), 14>: Chord (0, 11) in cycle <16, 14, 11, 0>
- <18, (8, 17), 0>: Chord (8, 17) in cycle <18, 17, 8, 0>
- <18, (3, 15), 17>: Chord (3, 15) in cycle <18, 17, 15, 3>

Step 3:
There are [7] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
