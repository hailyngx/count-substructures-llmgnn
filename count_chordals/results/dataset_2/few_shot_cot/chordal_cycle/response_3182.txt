Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 9, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 2, 7, 3, 6, 1, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 3, 7, 2, 9, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 8, 5, 2, 9, 4, 0>
- Cycle 6: <5, 1, 6, 3, 4, 9, 7, 2, 5>
- Cycle 7: <5, 8, 0, 6, 3, 4, 9, 2, 5>
- Cycle 8: <6, 1, 9, 4, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 6>
- Cycle 9: <6, 1, 9, 7, 3, 4, 0, 8, 5, 6>
- Cycle 10: <6, 8, 0, 5, 2, 9, 4, 3, 7, 6>
- Cycle 11: <7, 2, 5, 8, 0, 4, 9, 1, 6, 7>
- Cycle 12: <7, 3, 6, 1, 9, 4, 0, 5, 8, 7>
- Cycle 13: <9, 1, 6, 0, 4, 3, 7, 2, 5, 9>

Step 2: Checking for one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: Chord = (0, 9)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: Chord = (0, 5)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: Chord = (2, 7)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: Chord = (7, 6)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: Chord = (8, 6)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: Chord = (5, 3)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: Chord = (8, 6)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: Chord = (1, 9)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: Chord = (6, 3)
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: Chord = (6, 3)
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: Chord = (2, 5)
- Cycle 12 has 1 chord: Chord = (6, 1)
- Cycle 13 has 1 chord: Chord = (1, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
