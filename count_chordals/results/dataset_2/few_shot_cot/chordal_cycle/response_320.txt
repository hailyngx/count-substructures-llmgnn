Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
- One cycle of length 4: (5, 9, 3, 5)
- Another cycle of length 4: (5, 9, 7, 6)
- Another cycle of length 4: (5, 4, 2, 5)

Step 2:
- The cycle (5, 9, 3, 5) has a chord (9, 3), making it a chordal 4-cycle <5, 9, (9, 3), 3>.
- The cycle (5, 9, 7, 6) has a chord (9, 7), making it a chordal 4-cycle <5, 9, (9, 7), 6>.
- The cycle (5, 4, 2, 5) has a chord (4, 2), making it a chordal 4-cycle <5, 4, (4, 2), 2>.

Step 3:
- There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
