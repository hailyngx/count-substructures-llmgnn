Response:
Step 1: 
Based on the given edge list and adjacency list, the cycles of length 4 or more are as follows:
- <3, 15, 7, 5, 13>
- <3, 15, 7, 6, 16>
- <3, 15, 7, 6, 16, 9>
- <3, 15, 7, 6, 16, 12>
- <3, 15, 12, 1, 19>
- <3, 15, 12, 1, 19, 11>
- <3, 15, 12, 1, 19, 0>
- <3, 15, 12, 16, 9, 2>
- <3, 15, 12, 16, 9, 18>
- <15, 7, 6, 16, 9, 8>
- <15, 7, 6, 16, 12, 1>
- <15, 7, 6, 16, 12, 16>
- <15, 7, 6, 16, 12, 1, 19>
- <15, 7, 6, 16, 12, 1, 19, 11>
- <15, 7, 6, 16, 9, 18, 2>
- <15, 12, 1, 19, 11, 0>
- <15, 12, 1, 19, 0, 11>
- <15, 12, 16, 9, 18, 2>
- <7, 6, 16, 9, 18, 2>
- <12, 16, 9, 18, 2, 13>
- <12, 16, 9, 18, 2, 4>
- <12, 16, 9, 18, 2, 17>
- <16, 9, 18, 2, 13, 5>
- <16, 9, 18, 2, 4, 11>
- <16, 9, 18, 2, 17, 4>

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <3, 15, 12, 1> with chord (3, 12)
- <3, 15, 12, 1> with chord (15, 1)
- <3, 15, 12, 16> with chord (15, 16)
- <15, 12, 1, 19> with chord (12, 19)
- <15, 12, 16, 9> with chord (12, 9)

Step 3:
As there are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [5].
