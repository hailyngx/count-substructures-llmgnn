Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 10) (11, 0) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 7) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 18) (5, 15) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 17) (6, 14) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 13) (17, 6) (17, 1) (17, 12) (4, 9) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (15, 16) (15, 5) (15, 10) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 18) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 1) (14, 6) (14, 18) (14, 12) (2, 3) (19, 1) (19, 3) (12, 9) (12, 17) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 18) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 3) (18, 5) (18, 0) (18, 14) (18, 12) (18, 3) (3, 2) (3, 19) (3, 13) (3, 18)

Node 18 is connected to node 5, 0, 14, 12, and node 3
Node 19 is connected to node 1, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (0, 11, 16, 15, 5, 9, 7, 16)
- Cycle 2: (0, 11, 16, 7, 1, 17, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (0, 11, 16, 7, 9, 12, 17, 6)
- Cycle 4: (0, 11, 16, 7, 1, 17, 12, 14)
- Cycle 5: (16, 15, 5, 6, 17, 12, 14, 18)
- Cycle 6: (16, 15, 5, 9, 7, 1, 17, 6)
- Cycle 7: (16, 15, 10, 13, 3, 19, 1, 7)
- Cycle 8: (16, 7, 1, 19, 3, 13, 12, 17)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 11, 16, 5>, chord: (9, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 11, 16, 7>, chord: (1, 17)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 11, 16, 7>, chord: (9, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 11, 16, 7>, chord: (12, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 6, 17, 12>, chord: (14, 18)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, 6, 17, 12>, chord: (1, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <10, 13, 3, 19>, chord: (7, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, 3, 13, 12>, chord: (17, 19)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0. 

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
