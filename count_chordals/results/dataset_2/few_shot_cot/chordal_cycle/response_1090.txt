Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle <0, 4, 6, 5> with edges (0, 4), (4, 6), (6, 5), (5, 0)
- Cycle <0, 4, 7, 1> with edges (0, 4), (4, 7), (7, 1), (1, 0)
- Cycle <0, 4, 7, 9> with edges (0, 4), (4, 7), (7, 9), (9, 0)
- Cycle <0, 7, 9, 1> with edges (0, 7), (7, 9), (9, 1), (1, 0)
- Cycle <1, 7, 4, 6> with edges (1, 7), (7, 4), (4, 6), (6, 1)
- Cycle <1, 7, 9, 0> with edges (1, 7), (7, 9), (9, 0), (0, 1)
- Cycle <2, 0, 4, 6> with edges (2, 0), (0, 4), (4, 6), (6, 2)
- Cycle <3, 7, 4, 6> with edges (3, 7), (7, 4), (4, 6), (6, 3)
- Cycle <5, 4, 7, 1> with edges (5, 4), (4, 7), (7, 1), (1, 5)
- Cycle <5, 6, 4, 0> with edges (5, 6), (6, 4), (4, 0), (0, 5)
- Cycle <6, 4, 7, 1> with edges (6, 4), (4, 7), (7, 1), (1, 6)
- Cycle <9, 7, 4, 0> with edges (9, 7), (7, 4), (4, 0), (0, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the listed cycles, <0, 4, 7, 1> has exactly one chord (4, 1).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 11 chordless 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [11].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, 4, 7, 1>
