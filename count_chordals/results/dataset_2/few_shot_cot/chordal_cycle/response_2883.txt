Response:
The number of chordless 4-cycles in the given graph is [8].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <5, 9, 4, 13> with the chord (9, 13)
2. <5, 14, 1, 12> with the chord (14, 12)
3. <5, 14, 2, 0> with the chord (14, 0)
4. <9, 4, 7, 1> with the chord (4, 7)
5. <7, 11, 3, 0> with the chord (11, 0)
6. <3, 9, 4, 13> with the chord (9, 13)
7. <4, 7, 1, 8> with the chord (7, 1)
8. <7, 1, 12, 14> with the chord (12, 14)
