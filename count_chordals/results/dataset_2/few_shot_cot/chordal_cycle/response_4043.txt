Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <1, 5, 6, 9>
- <1, 5, 8, 7>
- <1, 9, 4, 2>
- <1, 9, 7, 6>
- <2, 4, 9, 6>
- <2, 4, 1, 7>
- <2, 1, 5, 8>
- <3, 0, 8, 5>
- <3, 8, 2, 4>
- <5, 6, 9, 4>
- <5, 8, 7, 6>
- <6, 9, 4, 1>
- <6, 7, 1, 5>
- <7, 1, 2, 9>
- <7, 9, 4, 2>
- <8, 5, 6, 7>
- <8, 6, 9, 4>
- <8, 7, 1, 5>
- <9, 6, 7, 1>
- <9, 4, 1, 5>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- <2, (4, 6), 1>
- <2, 4, (1, 7)>
- <1, (5, 7), 9>
- <1, 9, (4, 2)>
- <3, 0, (8, 5)>
- <8, 5, (6, 7)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [14]
