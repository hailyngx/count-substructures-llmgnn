Step 2: Checking for chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <0, 9, 7, 4, 0> (Chord: (9, 7))
- Chordal Cycle 2: <0, 1, 7, 4, 0> (Chord: (1, 4))
- Chordal Cycle 3: <1, 5, 4, 7, 1> (Chord: (5, 7))
- Chordal Cycle 4: <1, 5, 6, 4, 1> (Chord: (5, 4))
- Chordal Cycle 5: <2, 9, 7, 4, 2> (Chord: (9, 7))
- Chordal Cycle 6: <4, 5, 6, 3, 4> (Chord: (5, 3))
- Chordal Cycle 7: <5, 6, 3, 7, 5> (Chord: (6, 7))
- Chordal Cycle 8: <7, 9, 5, 3, 7> (Chord: (9, 5))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]
