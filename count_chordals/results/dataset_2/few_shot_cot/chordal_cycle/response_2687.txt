Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

1. Cycle <6, 5, 1, 9, 6> with chord (1, 9)
2. Cycle <6, 0, 3, 7, 8, 6> with chord (3, 7)
3. Cycle <6, 2, 4, 8, 6> with chord (2, 4)
4. Cycle <6, 8, 7, 3, 0, 6> with chord (7, 3)
5. Cycle <9, 1, 5, 4, 8, 9> with chord (5, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chorded Cycles:
<6, 5, 1, 9, 6> with chord (1, 9)
<6, 0, 3, 7, 8, 6> with chord (3, 7)
<6, 2, 4, 8, 6> with chord (2, 4)
<6, 8, 7, 3, 0, 6> with chord (7, 3)
<9, 1, 5, 4, 8, 9> with chord (5, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles found.

So, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
