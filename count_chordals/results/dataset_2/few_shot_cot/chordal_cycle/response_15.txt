Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- We can see that there are many cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. However, we will focus on the cycles with 4 nodes for this problem. Here are the cycles of length 4:
    1. Cycle <17, 0, 15, 18> with edges (17, 0), (0, 15), (15, 18), and (18, 17).
    2. Cycle <4, 13, 12, 2> with edges (4, 13), (13, 12), (12, 2), and (2, 4).
    3. Cycle <16, 1, 2, 8> with edges (16, 1), (1, 2), (2, 8), and (8, 16).
    4. Cycle <14, 5, 1, 2> with edges (14, 5), (5, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 14).
    5. Cycle <13, 11, 6, 11> with edges (13, 11), (11, 6), (6, 11), and (11, 13).
    6. Cycle <10, 3, 10, 4> with edges (10, 3), (3, 10), (10, 4), and (4, 10).

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- After analyzing each cycle above, we find that cycle <17, 0, 15, 18> has exactly one chord (15, 17).
- Hence, we have found 1 chordal 4-cycle.

Putting the final count inside brackets, we have found [1].
And the unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <17, (15, 17), 0, 15, 18>.
