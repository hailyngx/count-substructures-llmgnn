Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1:  
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 8, 5>
- Cycle 2: <6, 9, 4, 2, 6>
- Cycle 3: <6, 9, 5, 7, 6>
- Cycle 4: <6, 5, 7, 2, 6>
  
Step 2:
Out of the above cycles, Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (4,8).

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
