Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 7, 5, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 7, 4, 9, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 7, 9, 3, 8, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 7, 9, 4, 6, 8, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 7, 5, 9, 3, 8, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 8, 6, 4, 9, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 8, 6, 4, 7, 0>
- Cycle 8: <0, 8, 6, 2, 5, 8>
- Cycle 9: <0, 8, 6, 2, 9, 4, 0>
- Cycle 10: <2, 5, 9, 4, 6, 2>
- Cycle 11: <2, 5, 9, 4, 7, 5, 2>
- Cycle 12: <2, 5, 9, 7, 4, 6, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle <0, 1, 7, 5, 8, 0> has one chord (5, 8).
- The cycle <0, 1, 7, 9, 3, 8, 0> has one chord (3, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- There are 10 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count is [10]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 1, 7, 5, 8, 0> with chord (5, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 1, 7, 9, 3, 8, 0> with chord (3, 8)
