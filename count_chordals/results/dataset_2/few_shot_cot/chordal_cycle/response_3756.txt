Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <0, (12, 14), 10, 7)>.

Following the steps provided earlier:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 12, 2, 13, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 12, 10, 7, 4, 13, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 12, 10, 14, 13, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 13, 4, 9, 14, 0)
- Cycle 5: (4, 7, 12, 10, 14, 9, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 7, 10, 12, 2, 13, 4)
- Cycle 7: (6, 9, 4, 13, 2, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 9, 14, 10, 12, 2, 6)
- Cycle 9: (7, 12, 10, 14, 9, 4, 7)
- Cycle 10: (3, 8, 5, 1, 9, 14, 3)
- Cycle 11: (1, 5, 8, 11, 6, 9, 1)
- Cycle 12: (13, 14, 10, 7, 4, 9, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- The only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 2: (0, 12, 10, 7, 4, 13, 0) with chord (12, 14).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 11.

Therefore, the final answer is [11].
