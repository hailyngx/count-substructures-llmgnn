Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 11 - 3 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 11 - 16 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 10 - 14 - 10
- Cycle 4: 0 - 10 - 15 - 16 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 5: 0 - 6 - 1 - 16 - 11 - 0
- Cycle 6: 0 - 6 - 12 - 8 - 4 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 7: 0 - 6 - 15 - 7 - 4 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 8: 0 - 9 - 18 - 9
- Cycle 9: 1 - 16 - 11 - 3 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 10: 1 - 2 - 7 - 4 - 8 - 12 - 1
- Cycle 11: 3 - 9 - 18 - 9 - 12
- Cycle 12: 4 - 7 - 17 - 3 - 11 - 4
- Cycle 13: 4 - 8 - 15 - 13 - 19 - 4
- Cycle 14: 5 - 19 - 8 - 12 - 6 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 15: 7 - 15 - 13 - 19 - 5 - 7
- Cycle 16: 8 - 12 - 9 - 3 - 17 - 8
- Cycle 17: 10 - 14 - 10
- Cycle 18: 10 - 15 - 13 - 19 - 5 - 10
- Cycle 19: 12 - 8 - 4 - 7 - 17 - 3 - 12
- Cycle 20: 12 - 9 - 0 - 11 - 16 - 1 - 12
- Cycle 21: 13 - 19 - 8 - 4 - 7 - 17 - 13
- Cycle 22: 15 - 7 - 17 - 3 - 9 - 15
- Cycle 23: 15 - 13 - 10 - 14 - 10 - 15
- Cycle 24: 15 - 6 - 1 - 2 - 7 - 17 - 15

Step 2:
Among these cycles, cycle 4: 0 - 10 - 15 - 16 - 1 - 0 has exactly one chord: (10, 16). So, this is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
The total number of unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle is <0, 10, 15, 16>.
