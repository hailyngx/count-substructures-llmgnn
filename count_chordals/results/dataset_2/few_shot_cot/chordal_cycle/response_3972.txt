Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Node 0 -> Node 5 -> Node 8 -> Node 6 -> Node 2 -> Node 0
- Node 0 -> Node 5 -> Node 9 -> Node 7 -> Node 2 -> Node 0
- Node 0 -> Node 8 -> Node 6 -> Node 3 -> Node 2 -> Node 0
- Node 1 -> Node 9 -> Node 5 -> Node 8 -> Node 1
- Node 1 -> Node 9 -> Node 8 -> Node 6 -> Node 4 -> Node 1
- Node 2 -> Node 7 -> Node 9 -> Node 5 -> Node 2
- Node 2 -> Node 7 -> Node 0 -> Node 5 -> Node 2
- Node 2 -> Node 6 -> Node 4 -> Node 8 -> Node 2
- Node 3 -> Node 7 -> Node 0 -> Node 2 -> Node 3
- Node 3 -> Node 7 -> Node 9 -> Node 1 -> Node 4 -> Node 3
- Node 4 -> Node 9 -> Node 5 -> Node 8 -> Node 4
- Node 4 -> Node 9 -> Node 7 -> Node 3 -> Node 6 -> Node 4
- Node 5 -> Node 9 -> Node 7 -> Node 2 -> Node 5
- Node 6 -> Node 4 -> Node 8 -> Node 0 -> Node 6

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (unique chordal 4-cycles) are:
- <0, 8, 4, 1> (5, 9)
- <2, 7, 9, 5> (0, 2)
- <2, 7, 0, 5> (2, 7)
- <2, 6, 4, 8> (2, 6)
- <3, 7, 0, 2> (3, 7)
- <3, 7, 9, 1> (4, 3)
- <4, 9, 5, 8> (4, 9)
- <4, 9, 7, 3> (6, 4)
- <5, 9, 7, 2> (5, 9)
- <6, 4, 8, 0> (6, 8)

Step 3:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
