Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph are:

<0, 15, 19, 16>  
<2, 4, 17, 6>  
<2, 14, 12, 10>  
<2, 14, 15, 5>  
<3, 4, 16, 19>  
<3, 4, 17, 6>  
<6, 16, 11, 0>  
<10, 12, 7, 9>  
<10, 18, 19, 15>  
<12, 14, 1, 6>  
<12, 14, 15, 0>  
<12, 14, 2, 5>  
<15, 5, 2, 13>  

After checking each of these cycles for exactly one chord, we find that all of them are chordal 4-cycles. Thus, the number of chordless cycles found is [13].
