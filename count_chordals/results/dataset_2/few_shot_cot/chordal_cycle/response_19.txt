Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- (1, 5, 9, 2, 1)
- (1, 5, 9, 8, 1)
- (1, 7, 4, 3, 1)
- (1, 7, 4, 2, 1)
- (1, 7, 8, 3, 1)
- (1, 8, 3, 4, 1)
- (2, 4, 7, 3, 2)
- (2, 4, 7, 8, 2)
- (2, 6, 9, 5, 2)
- (2, 6, 9, 1, 2)
- (2, 7, 4, 3, 2)
- (2, 7, 8, 3, 2)
- (3, 4, 7, 0, 3)
- (3, 4, 7, 2, 3)
- (3, 7, 8, 1, 3)
- (4, 7, 8, 1, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The cycle (1, 5, 9, 2, 1) has a chord (2, 9).
- The cycle (1, 5, 9, 8, 1) has a chord (8, 9).
- The cycle (1, 7, 4, 3, 1) has a chord (4, 3).
- The cycle (1, 7, 4, 2, 1) has a chord (4, 2).
- The cycle (1, 7, 8, 3, 1) has a chord (8, 3).
- The cycle (1, 8, 3, 4, 1) is chordal.
- The cycle (2, 4, 7, 3, 2) is chordal.
- The cycle (2, 4, 7, 8, 2) has a chord (4, 8).
- The cycle (2, 6, 9, 5, 2) has a chord (6, 5).
- The cycle (2, 6, 9, 1, 2) has a chord (6, 1).
- The cycle (2, 7, 4, 3, 2) is chordal.
- The cycle (2, 7, 8, 3, 2) is chordal.
- The cycle (3, 4, 7, 0, 3) has a chord (0, 7).
- The cycle (3, 4, 7, 2, 3) has a chord (4, 2).
- The cycle (3, 7, 8, 1, 3) is chordal.
- The cycle (4, 7, 8, 1, 4) is chordal.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Count = [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, 8, 3, 4>
