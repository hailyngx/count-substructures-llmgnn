- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 2, 6, 8, 4>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 2, 6, 4, 9>
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 6, 2, 5, 2>
- Cycle 6: <0, 9, 6, 2, 4, 9>
- Cycle 7: <0, 9, 4, 8, 3, 0>
- Cycle 8: <0, 9, 4, 8, 1, 6>
- Cycle 9: <0, 9, 4, 8, 2, 6>
- Cycle 10: <0, 9, 4, 3, 8, 6>
- Cycle 11: <0, 8, 6, 2, 5, 2>
- Cycle 12: <0, 8, 6, 2, 4, 9>
- Cycle 13: <0, 8, 4, 9, 6, 2>
- Cycle 14: <0, 8, 4, 3, 8, 6>
- Cycle 15: <0, 3, 4, 9, 6, 2>
- Cycle 16: <1, 9, 6, 2, 5, 2>
- Cycle 17: <1, 9, 4, 8, 3, 0>
- Cycle 18: <1, 9, 4, 8, 6, 2>
- Cycle 19: <1, 6, 2, 8, 0, 3>
- Cycle 20: <1, 6, 4, 9, 6, 2>
- Cycle 21: <2, 5, 0, 3, 4, 9>
- Cycle 22: <2, 6, 9, 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle 23: <2, 6, 9, 4, 3, 8>
- Cycle 24: <2, 6, 9, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 25: <2, 6, 1, 7, 2, 5>
- Cycle 26: <2, 4, 8, 0, 3, 4>
- Cycle 27: <2, 4, 8, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 28: <2, 4, 3, 8, 6, 2>
- Cycle 29: <2, 8, 0, 3, 4, 9>
- Cycle 30: <2, 8, 4, 3, 8, 6>
- Cycle 31: <3, 4, 9, 6, 2, 5>
- Cycle 32: <3, 4, 9, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 33: <3, 8, 4, 9, 6, 2>
- Cycle 34: <4, 9, 6, 2, 5, 0>
- Cycle 35: <4, 9, 6, 1, 7, 2>
- Cycle 36: <6, 2, 5, 0, 3, 4>
- Cycle 37: <6, 2, 4, 3, 8, 6>
- Cycle 38: <6, 4, 3, 8, 6, 2>

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 17: <1, 9, 6, 2, 5, 2> with a chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 20: <1, 6, 4, 9, 6, 2> with a chord (9, 4)
- Cycle 30: <2, 8, 4, 3, 8, 6> with a chord (2, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 38 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [38].
