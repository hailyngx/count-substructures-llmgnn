Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 11, 2, 1> with chords 8-2, 11-1, and 1-8
- Cycle 2: <1, 13, 14, 17, 15> with chords 13-17, 14-15, and 15-13
- Cycle 3: <3, 9, 8, 11, 2> with chords 3-8, 9-11, and 8-3
- Cycle 4: <4, 7, 15, 12, 19> with chords 4-15, 7-12, and 15-4
- Cycle 5: <5, 8, 0, 16, 4> with chords 5-0, 8-4, and 4-5
- Cycle 6: <6, 19, 14, 17, 10> with chords 6-14, 19-17, and 17-6

Step 2: Checking for the presence of exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 1 <0, 8, 11, 2, 1> has exactly one chord 8-2
- Only Cycle 2 <1, 13, 14, 17, 15> has exactly one chord 13-17
- Only Cycle 3 <3, 9, 8, 11, 2> has exactly one chord 9-11
- Only Cycle 4 <4, 7, 15, 12, 19> has exactly one chord 4-15
- Only Cycle 5 <5, 8, 0, 16, 4> has exactly one chord 0-16
- Only Cycle 6 <6, 19, 14, 17, 10> has exactly one chord 6-14

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
Therefore, there are [0] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
