Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

Cycles: 
1) <0, 1, 15, 5, 0>
2) <0, 1, 16, 4, 9, 6, 3, 0>
3) <0, 3, 14, 5, 0>
4) <0, 3, 6, 9, 4, 16, 1, 0>
5) <0, 10, 8, 2, 3, 0>
6) <0, 10, 7, 5, 18, 0>
7) <0, 10, 12, 19, 15, 1, 16, 4, 9, 6, 3, 0>
8) <0, 10, 18, 5, 15, 1, 16, 4, 9, 6, 3, 0>
9) <1, 15, 5, 0, 3, 6, 9, 4, 16, 1>
10) <2, 8, 10, 0, 3, 6, 9, 4, 16, 1, 15, 5, 18, 11, 14, 7>
11) <2, 8, 10, 0, 3, 6, 9, 4, 16, 1, 15, 19, 12, 10>
12) <2, 17, 3, 6, 9, 4, 16, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 1, 15, 5, 0>
<0, 10, 8, 2, 3, 0>
<0, 10, 7, 5, 18, 0>
<1, 15, 5, 0, (3-6)-9-(4-16)-1>
<2, 8, 10, 0, 3>
<4, 9, 6, 3, 0>
<4, 9, 6, 3, 14>
<5, 15, 1, 16, 4>
<7, 5, 15, 19, 12>
<8, 2, 17, 3, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
