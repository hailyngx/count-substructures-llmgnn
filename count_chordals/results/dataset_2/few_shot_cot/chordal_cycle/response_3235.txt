Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 10, 8, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 3, 13, 0, 7, 2, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 4, 12, 6, 7, 2, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 4, 14, 1, 2, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 9, 4, 14, 11, 12, 6, 7, 2, 5>
- Cycle 6: <5, 9, 4, 12, 10, 1, 2, 5>
- Cycle 7: <5, 9, 4, 14, 11, 13, 6, 7, 0, 5>
- Cycle 8: <7, 0, 13, 11, 12, 6, 14, 1, 10, 8, 5, 2, 7>
- Cycle 9: <8, 5, 4, 12, 6, 13, 0, 7, 2, 1, 10, 9, 3, 13, 11, 14, 4>
- Cycle 10: <10, 9, 4, 14, 11, 13, 6, 12, 10>
- Cycle 11: <11, 12, 6, 7, 0, 13, 3, 10, 1, 14, 11>
- Cycle 12: <13, 0, 5, 2, 1, 10, 3, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Checking each cycle, we find that Cycle 3: <5, 9, 4, 12, 6, 7, 2, 5> has exactly one chord 12-2.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found with exactly one chord, so [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <5, 9, 4, 12, 6, 7, 2, 5>
