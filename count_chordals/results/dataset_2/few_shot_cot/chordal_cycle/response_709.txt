Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 26, 14, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 26, 10, 28, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 26, 12, 20, 6, 10, 28, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 2, 24, 9, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 2, 24, 4, 11, 1, 15, 21, 2)
- Cycle 6: (5, 2, 24, 4, 11, 1, 15, 17, 19, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 19, 17, 15, 21, 2, 27, 7, 22, 17)
- Cycle 8: (5, 19, 17, 22, 16, 0, 8, 23, 19)
- Cycle 9: (5, 28, 18, 3, 18, 25, 22, 7, 27, 2, 5)
- Cycle 10: (9, 26, 14, 22, 7, 27, 16, 0, 4, 24, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 26, 14, 22, 16, 0, 8, 11, 1, 15, 21, 2, 24, 9)
- Cycle 12: (10, 26, 14, 22, 7, 27, 2, 24, 9, 26)
- Cycle 13: (15, 21, 2, 27, 7, 22, 16, 27, 2, 21)
- Cycle 14: (5, 19, 23, 8, 0, 4, 24, 2, 5)
- Cycle 15: (10, 25, 22, 16, 27, 7, 22, 14, 26, 12, 20, 6, 10)
- Cycle 16: (6, 20, 29, 13, 0, 16, 27, 2, 24, 4, 11, 8, 23, 19, 17, 22)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, (10, 28), 18, 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <17, (5, 19), 23, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 16 chordless cycles found, so the final number is [16].
