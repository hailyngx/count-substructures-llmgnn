Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 2, 1, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 2, 3, 8>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 7, 8, 3>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 2, 1, 4>
- Cycle 6: <2, 5, 6, 7, 8>
- Cycle 7: <2, 5, 6, 0, 3>
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 9, 7, 4>
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 6, 0, 5>
- Cycle 10: <4, 7, 8, 3, 0>
- Cycle 11: <4, 1, 6, 0, 5>
- Cycle 12: <7, 9, 8, 3, 0>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, (5,2), 1, 4> - Chord: (5,2)
- <0, (5,6), 7, 8, 3> - Chord: (5,6)
- <2, (5,9), 7, 4> - Chord: (5,9)
- <4, 7, 6, (0,5)> - Chord: (0,5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the answer is [1].
