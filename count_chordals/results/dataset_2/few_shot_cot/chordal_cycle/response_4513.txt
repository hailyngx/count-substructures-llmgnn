Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Since there are no chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [0].
