Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 8, 26> has a chord between 4 and 8.
- <1, 7, 21, 29> has a chord between 7 and 21.
- <2, 16, 4, 8> has a chord between 4 and 16.
- <3, 23, 17, 14> has a chord between 17 and 23.
- <6, 1, 7, 20> has a chord between 1 and 7.
- <10, 21, 15, 27> has a chord between 15 and 21.
- <11, 17, 22, 27> has a chord between 17 and 22.
- <12, 19, 5, 29> has a chord between 5 and 19.
- <13, 10, 21, 29> has a chord between 10 and 21.
- <16, 2, 28, 8> has a chord between 2 and 28.
- <24, 26, 8, 4> has a chord between 8 and 26.
- <25, 13, 28, 2> has a chord between 13 and 28.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 6 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [6].
