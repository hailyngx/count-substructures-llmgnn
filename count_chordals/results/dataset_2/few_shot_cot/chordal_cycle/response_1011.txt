Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 1, 3>
- <0, 5, 6, 2>
- <0, 1, 5, 6>
- <0, 3, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 3, 6>
- <2, 5, 6, 3>
- <2, 5, 1, 3>
- <2, 9, 4, 7>
- <3, 5, 6, 2>
- <3, 5, 1, 0>
- <3, 6, 5, 2>
- <4, 9, 8, 7>
- <5, 6, 3, 0>
- <5, 6, 2, 9>
- <5, 6, 3, 1>
- <5, 6, 2, 7>
- <6, 5, 2, 7>
- <6, 5, 2, 9>
- <7, 4, 9, 8>
- <8, 9, 4, 7>

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the only chordal 4-cycle is <0, 5, 1, 3> with a chord connecting nodes 1 and 3.

Step 3:
So, the number of chordless cycles found is [20].
