Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
1. (0, 4, 5, 1, 0)
2. (0, 4, 8, 2, 0)
3. (0, 4, 9, 7, 0)
4. (1, 6, 3, 2, 1)
5. (1, 6, 5, 0, 1)
6. (1, 5, 4, 8, 1)
7. (1, 5, 6, 2, 1)
8. (2, 3, 0, 5, 2)
9. (2, 3, 6, 1, 2)
10. (2, 6, 5, 1, 2)
11. (2, 6, 8, 4, 2)
12. (4, 8, 2, 6, 4)
13. (4, 8, 9, 7, 4)
14. (4, 9, 7, 0, 4)
15. (5, 4, 8, 2, 5)
16. (5, 4, 9, 7, 5)
17. (5, 1, 6, 3, 5)
18. (6, 1, 5, 4, 6)
19. (6, 1, 0, 5, 6)
20. (6, 3, 0, 5, 6)
21. (6, 3, 2, 8, 6)
22. (8, 4, 9, 2, 8)
23. (8, 4, 5, 0, 8)
24. (9, 4, 5, 0, 9)
25. (9, 4, 8, 2, 9)
26. (9, 7, 0, 5, 9)
27. (9, 7, 1, 6, 9)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (5, 6), 0>
- <2, (3, 8), 6>
- <4, (9, 7), 5>
- <5, (1, 6), 4>
- <8, (4, 2), 9>
- <9, (7, 1), 4>

Step 3: Final count of chordal 4-cycles: [6]
