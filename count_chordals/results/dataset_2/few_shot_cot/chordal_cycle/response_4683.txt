Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 12)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (1, 14)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (4, 2)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (6, 2)
- Cycle 14 has one chord: (4, 13)
- Cycle 16 has one chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 19 has one chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 20 has one chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 22 has one chord: (5, 10)
- Cycle 25 has one chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 26 has one chord: (4, 13)
- Cycle 28 has one chord: (1, 14)
- Cycle 29 has one chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 31 has one chord: (5, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
- Total number of chordless 4-cycles = [18]
