Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 0

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is: 
<5, 9, 4, 8>

Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph:
[1]
