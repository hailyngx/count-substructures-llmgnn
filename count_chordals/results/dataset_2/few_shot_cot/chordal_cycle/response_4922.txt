Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 7

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in this graph are as follows:
step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with all edges present:
- <1, 5, 4, 8, 1>
- <1, 5, 4, 6, 2, 1>
- <1, 5, 9, 7, 1>
- <1, 5, 9, 7, 3, 8, 1>
- <1, 2, 5, 4, 8, 1>
- <1, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1>

step 2: Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 5, 4, 8, 1> has a chord: (4, 8)
- <1, 5, 4, 6, 2, 1> has a chord: (4, 2)
- <1, 5, 9, 7, 1> has a chord: (9, 7)
- <1, 5, 9, 7, 3, 8, 1> has a chord: (3, 7)
- <1, 2, 5, 4, 8, 1> has a chord: (2, 8)
- <1, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1> has a chord: (6, 5)

step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in this graph. Hence, the final count is [0].
