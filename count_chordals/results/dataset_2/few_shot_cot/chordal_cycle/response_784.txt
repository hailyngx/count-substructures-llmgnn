Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycles: <0, (3, 6), 1)>, <0, (4, 22), 11)>, <0, (24, 29), 9)>, <6, (1, 14), 18)>, <6, (2, 10), 4)>, <9, (19, 26), 18)>, <14, (1, 12), 11)>, <20, (24, 29), 26)>, <21, (19, 5), 8)>, <21, (13, 2), 6)>, <24, (29, 0), 4)>.

Step 3:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number inside brackets is [11].
