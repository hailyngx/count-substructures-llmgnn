Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 0, 6> has chord (1, 6)
- <1, 3, 7, 9> has chord (1, 9)
- <1, 4, 9, 5> has chord (1, 5)
- <1, 4, 13, 11> has chord (1, 11)
- <1, 4, 7, 12> has chord (1, 12)
- <1, 8, 12, 2> has chord (1, 12)
- <5, 6, 0, 3> has chord (5, 3)
- <5, 9, 7, 4> has chord (5, 7)
- <9, 4, 13, 0> has chord (9, 13)
- <12, 7, 4, 1> has chord (12, 4)
- <12, 7, 14, 13> has chord (12, 13)
- <12, 8, 1, 4> has chord (12, 4)
- <12, 8, 6, 5> has chord (12, 6)
- <11, 13, 4, 9> has chord (11, 4)
- <11, 13, 0, 3> has chord (11, 3)
- <11, 13, 2, 5> has chord (11, 5)
- <14, 1, 8, 6> has chord (14, 8)
- <14, 7, 3, 0> has chord (14, 3)
- <14, 7, 9, 5> has chord (14, 9)
- <14, 10, 11, 13> has chord (14, 11)
- <2, 5, 9, 4> has chord (2, 9)
- <3, 6, 12, 8> has chord (3, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 26 cycles found, and 3 of them have chords. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is 26 - 3 = [23].
