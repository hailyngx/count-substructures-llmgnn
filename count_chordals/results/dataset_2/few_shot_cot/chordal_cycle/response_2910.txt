Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 2, 4, 1>
- <0, 2, 8, 1>
- <0, 5, 9, 6>
- <5, 9, 6, 7>
- <6, 7, 1, 9>
- <6, 5, 9, 2>
- <6, 7, 1, 4>
- <9, 2, 4, 1>
  
Step 2:
Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- <0, 2, 4, 1> has chord (0, 4)
- <0, 2, 8, 1> has chord (0, 8)
- <0, 5, 9, 6> has chord (5, 9)
- <5, 9, 6, 7> has chord (5, 6)
- <6, 7, 1, 9> has chord (7, 1)
- <6, 5, 9, 2> has chord (5, 2)
- <6, 7, 1, 4> has chord (7, 4)
- <9, 2, 4, 1> has chord (2, 1)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [0] chordless 4-cycles in the graph.
