Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <1, 5, 7, 4, 2, 6, 1> 
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 7, 4, 3, 2, 6, 1> 
- Cycle 3: <2, 4, 7, 5, 8, 3, 6, 2> 
- Cycle 4: <3, 4, 7, 5, 9, 1, 6, 3> 
- Cycle 5: <0, 4, 7, 5, 9, 1, 6, 0> 

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 2 has chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 3 has chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 4 has chord (3, 5)
- Cycle 5 has chord (0, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
