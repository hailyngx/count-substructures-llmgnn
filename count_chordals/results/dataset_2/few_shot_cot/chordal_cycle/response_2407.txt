Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph (ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists).
- Cycle <0, 8, 16, 0>
- Cycle <0, 2, 27, 9, 8, 0>
- Cycle <0, 2, 27, 9, 8, 20, 10, 11, 24, 14, 17, 21, 6, 5, 26, 3, 7, 28, 15, 16, 0>
- Cycle <0, 2, 27, 9, 8, 20, 10, 11, 29, 14, 24, 4, 15, 28, 7, 3, 26, 5, 19, 18, 17, 21, 6, 13, 3, 4, 24, 11>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The cycle <0, 8, 16, 0> has 0 chords.
- The cycle <0, 2, 27, 9, 8, 0> has 0 chords.
- The cycle <0, 2, 27, 9, 8, 20, 10, 11, 24, 14, 17, 21, 6, 5, 26, 3, 7, 28, 15, 16, 0> has 0 chords.
- The cycle <0, 2, 27, 9, 8, 20, 10, 11, 29, 14, 24, 4, 15, 28, 7, 3, 26, 5, 19, 18, 17, 21, 6, 13, 3, 4, 24, 11> has 1 chord, which is <14, 23>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 3 chordless cycles found.

Final Answer: [3]
