Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 12) (7, 10) (7, 13) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 6) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 7) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 9) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 4) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 5) (11, 6) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 8) (12, 1) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 9) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (1, 12) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (6, 8) (6, 11) (6, 3) (6, 1) (2, 0) (2, 1) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 14) (9, 3) (9, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 14, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 12, 6, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 11, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 12, 0, 14, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 11, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 11, 3, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 12, 10, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 11, 6, 12, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 13, 12, 14, 3, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 7, and node 13
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 8, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 1, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 8, 10, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 9

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 12, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 14, 9, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 14, 9, 13, 10, 7, 12, 1, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 14, 9, 13, 8, 6, 1, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 5, 11, 4, 14, 9, 1, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 5: <0, 5, 11, 4, 14, 9, 1, 5>. The chord is (11, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 4 chordless cycles found. So, the final count is [4].
