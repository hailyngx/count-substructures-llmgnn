Response:
Following the steps mentioned in the previous prompt to count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List of cycles with 4 or more nodes:

- Cycle: <1, 3, 16, 26>
- Cycle: <1, 18, 9, 6>
- Cycle: <1, 18, 27, 24>
- Cycle: <1, 11, 22, 29>
- Cycle: <3, 16, 8, 21>
- Cycle: <5, 26, 16, 8>
- Cycle: <5, 8, 21, 28>
- Cycle: <5, 8, 9, 6>
- Cycle: <6, 5, 26, 16>
- Cycle: <9, 6, 5, 8>
- Cycle: <9, 18, 27, 24>
- Cycle: <9, 18, 1, 12>
- Cycle: <16, 26, 4, 2>
- Cycle: <18, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle: <18, 27, 24, 14>
- Cycle: <19, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle: <19, 12, 17, 21>
- Cycle: <19, 21, 8, 16>
- Cycle: <21, 8, 9, 6>
- Cycle: <21, 19, 12, 17>
- Cycle: <21, 22, 11, 1>
- Cycle: <22, 11, 1, 3>
- Cycle: <22, 24, 27, 18>
- Cycle: <22, 29, 19, 9>
- Cycle: <24, 27, 18, 0>
- Cycle: <25, 28, 21, 19>
- Cycle: <26, 16, 8, 21>
- Cycle: <27, 18, 1, 11>
- Cycle: <27, 24, 14, 11>
- Cycle: <28, 21, 8, 9>
- Cycle: <29, 19, 12, 1>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

<1, (18, 9), 6>
<3, (16, 8), 26>
<5, (26, 16), 8>
<8, (9, 6), 5>
<9, (18, 27), 24>
<11, (22, 1), 29>
<12, (19, 29), 1>
<16, (26, 4), 2>
<18, (9, 6), 5>
<19, (9, 6), 5>
<21, (8, 9), 6>
<22, (11, 1), 3>
<24, (27, 18), 0>
<25, (28, 21), 19>
<26, (16, 8), 21>
<27, (18, 1), 11>
<28, (21, 8), 9>
<29, (19, 12), 1>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

Based on the above list, there are 18 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. Therefore, the final count is [18].
