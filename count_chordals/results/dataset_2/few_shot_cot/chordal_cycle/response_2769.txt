Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
Possible 4-cycles in the graph based on the given edges:
- Cycle 1: 5-6-1-4-5 (has a chord 1-4)
- Cycle 2: 5-6-3-9-5 (has a chord 3-9)
- Cycle 3: 5-6-0-1-5 (has a chord 0-1)
- Cycle 4: 5-6-0-7-5 (has a chord 0-7)
- Cycle 5: 5-4-9-3-5 (has a chord 3-9)
- Cycle 6: 5-4-1-6-5 (has a chord 1-6)
- Cycle 7: 5-4-1-0-5 (has a chord 1-0)
- Cycle 8: 5-2-9-4-5 (has a chord 9-4)
- Cycle 9: 5-2-7-9-5 (has a chord 7-9)
- Cycle 10: 5-2-8-5 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 11: 6-1-0-5-6 (has a chord 0-5)
- Cycle 12: 6-3-9-4-6 (has a chord 3-9)
- Cycle 13: 6-3-1-4-6 (has a chord 1-4)
- Cycle 14: 6-0-1-4-6 (has a chord 1-4)
- Cycle 15: 1-7-0-6-1 (has a chord 0-6)
- Cycle 16: 1-7-9-4-1 (has a chord 9-4)
- Cycle 17: 3-1-0-6-3 (has a chord 0-6)
- Cycle 18: 3-9-4-1-3 (has a chord 4-1)
- Cycle 19: 4-9-3-6-4 (has a chord 3-6)
- Cycle 20: 7-0-6-1-7 (has a chord 6-1)
- Cycle 21: 8-5-2-9-8 (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 22: 8-5-4-1-8 (chordless cycle)

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, 6, 1, 4>
- <5, 6, 3, 9>
- <5, 6, 0, 1>
- <5, 6, 0, 7>
- <5, 4, 9, 3>
- <5, 4, 1, 6>
- <5, 4, 1, 0>
- <5, 2, 9, 4>
- <5, 2, 7, 9>
- <6, 1, 0, 5>
- <6, 3, 9, 4>
- <6, 3, 1, 4>
- <6, 0, 1, 4>
- <1, 7, 0, 6>
- <3, 9, 4, 1>
- <4, 9, 3, 6>
- <7, 0, 6, 1>

Step 3:
Number of chordless 4-cycles found = 2
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [17].
