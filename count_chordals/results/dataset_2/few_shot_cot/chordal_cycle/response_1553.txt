Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. <0, 6, 17, 2>
2. <1, 7, 11, 18>
3. <4, 5, 2, 17>
4. <4, 10, 16, 8>
5. <6, 14, 1, 13>
6. <9, 1, 14, 3>
7. <9, 3, 14, 6>
8. <11, 7, 1, 13>
9. <11, 7, 13, 19>
10. <11, 9, 1, 13>
11. <12, 6, 17, 0>
12. <12, 6, 14, 3>
13. <12, 11, 7, 13>
14. <13, 1, 14, 18>
15. <14, 6, 0, 17>
16. <14, 18, 8, 16>
17. <17, 0, 6, 19>
18. <17, 2, 4, 5>
19. <17, 6, 14, 18>
20. <19, 6, 12, 15>

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, 7, 13, 19> (Chord: (13, 19))
2. <11, 7, 13, 1> (Chord: (7, 13))
3. <11, 9, 1, 13> (Chord: (9, 13))
4. <12, 6, 14, 3> (Chord: (6, 14))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 16 chordless cycles. 

Therefore, the final answer is [16].
