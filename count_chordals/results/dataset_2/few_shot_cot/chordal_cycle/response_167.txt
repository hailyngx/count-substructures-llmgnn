Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
<0, 5, 10, 6>
<0, 5, 7, 11>
<0, 3, 1, 4>
<0, 3, 14, 6>
<0, 13, 4, 1>
<0, 13, 6, 14>
<1, 3, 14, 6>
<1, 4, 12, 10>
<1, 4, 13, 6>
<3, 9, 10, 6>
<3, 14, 4, 8>
<4, 12, 10, 6>
<4, 13, 10, 5>
<5, 7, 11, 13>
<5, 8, 4, 12>
<6, 10, 12, 14>

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <0, 5, 10, 6> with the chord (3, 14).

Step 3: 
Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [16].
