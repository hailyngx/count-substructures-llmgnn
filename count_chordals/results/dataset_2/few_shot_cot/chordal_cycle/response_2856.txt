Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<1, 4, 7, 12>
<1, 4, 9, 11>
<1, 4, 9, 14>
<1, 4, 3, 9>
<1, 4, 3, 13>
<1, 7, 10, 4>
<1, 7, 12, 5>
<1, 11, 9, 14>
<1, 11, 8, 1>
<1, 11, 10, 4>
<1, 2, 12, 7>
<1, 2, 14, 9>
<4, 7, 12, 5>
<4, 7, 10, 11>
<4, 7, 10, 0>
<4, 9, 14, 6>
<4, 9, 14, 13>
<4, 9, 3, 13>
<4, 10, 7, 12>
<4, 10, 11, 7>
<4, 10, 11, 1>
<4, 3, 9, 11>
<4, 3, 13, 6>
<4, 3, 13, 14>
<7, 12, 5, 6>
<7, 12, 6, 14>
<7, 10, 11, 1>
<7, 10, 11, 9>
<7, 10, 0, 10>
<9, 11, 1, 8>
<9, 11, 10, 7>
<9, 14, 6, 13>
<9, 14, 13, 3>
<2, 12, 7, 4>
<2, 12, 13, 6>
<2, 14, 9, 4>
<2, 14, 13, 3>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, 4, 9, 11> (Chord: (9, 11))
<1, 11, 9, 14> (Chord: (9, 14))
<4, 9, 14, 6> (Chord: (9, 14))
<2, 12, 7, 4> (Chord: (7, 12))

Step 3:
Thus, the number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].
