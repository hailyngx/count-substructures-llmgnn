Response:
Step 1: 
There are 5 cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <0, 15, 20, 11, 16>
2. <0, 15, 9, 27, 10>
3. <5, 19, 21, 24, 9>
4. <2, 22, 5, 0, 15>
5. <2, 22, 5, 29, 3>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, only cycle <0, 15, 9, 27, 10> has exactly one chord: edge (15, 9).

Step 3:
There is only one chordal 4-cycle in the graph, so the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 15, 9, 27, 10>
