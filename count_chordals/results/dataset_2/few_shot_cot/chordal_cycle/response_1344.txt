Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
Four cycles of length 4 found in the graph are:
1. (0, 5, 8, 0)
2. (1, 5, 0, 1)
3. (2, 4, 9, 1)
4. (3, 5, 9, 3)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
1. (0, 5, 8, 0) - Chord (5, 8)
2. (1, 5, 0, 1) - Chord (5, 0)
3. (2, 4, 9, 1) - Chord (4, 1)
4. (3, 5, 9, 3) - Chord (5, 9)

Step 3:
As all cycles have exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, (5, 8), 0>
<2, (5, 0), 1>
<3, (4, 1), 9>
<4, (5, 9), 3>
