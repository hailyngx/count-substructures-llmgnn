Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 4) (10, 1) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 3) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (2, 10) (2, 8) (2, 12) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 13) (5, 12) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 0) (0, 11) (0, 13) (0, 6) (7, 13) (7, 9) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 7) (9, 14) (12, 2) (12, 5) (12, 13) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 10) (6, 8) (6, 0) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, 13, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 10, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 10, 8, and node 12
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 14, 6, 5, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 11, 4, 13, and node 12
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 10, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 13, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 10, 2, 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 13, 7, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 11, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 14, 0, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 12, 9, 7, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 11, and node 9

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 10, 1, 4, 5>   (length 5 cycle)
- Cycle 2: <0, 11, 14, 9, 13, 7>  (length 5 cycle)
- Cycle 3: <1, 10, 11, 14, 3, 4>  (length 6 cycle)
- Cycle 4: <1, 10, 11, 5, 3, 4>   (length 6 cycle)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (11, 1)
- Cycle 2 has chord (11, 9)
- Cycle 3 has chord (10, 11)
- Cycle 4 has chord (10, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
