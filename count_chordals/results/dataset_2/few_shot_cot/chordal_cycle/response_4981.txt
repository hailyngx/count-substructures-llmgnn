Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle with nodes 0->6->10->4->5->2->0
- Cycle with nodes 0->6->10->3->7->8->0
- Cycle with nodes 0->6->7->3->4->10->0
- Cycle with nodes 0->6->9->13->14->8->0
- Cycle with nodes 1->10->4->5->12->9->1
- Cycle with nodes 1->10->4->3->7->8->1
- Cycle with nodes 1->14->13->9->11->6->1
- Cycle with nodes 1->14->8->7->3->10->1

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 6, 10, 4> (Chord: 10->4)  
- <0, 6, 10, 3> (Chord: 10->3)
- <0, 6, 7, 3> (Chord: 6->3)
- <0, 6, 9, 13> (Chord: 9->13)
- <1, 10, 4, 5> (Chord: 4->5)
- <1, 10, 4, 3> (Chord: 4->3)
- <1, 14, 13, 9> (Chord: 13->9)
- <1, 14, 8, 7> (Chord: 8->7)

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles = [8]
