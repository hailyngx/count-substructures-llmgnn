Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 19, 26, 5>
- <1, 12, 17, 10>
- <2, 9, 10, 5>
- <3, 4, 22, 16>
- <4, 22, 21, 3>
- <5, 10, 28, 20>
- <7, 27, 15, 25>
- <8, 21, 22, 4>
- <13, 25, 8, 21>
- <14, 1, 12, 17>
- <16, 22, 8, 25>
- <18, 29, 15, 25>
- <20, 25, 13, 26>
- <21, 22, 8, 25>
- <22, 8, 25, 13>
- <24, 26, 19, 0>
- <26, 5, 0, 19>
- <28, 16, 22, 8>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 19, 26, 5> has one chord <0, 26>
- <1, 12, 17, 10> has one chord <1, 17>
- <2, 9, 10, 5> has one chord <2, 10>
- <3, 4, 22, 16> has one chord <3, 22>
- <4, 22, 21, 3> has one chord <4, 21>
- <5, 10, 28, 20> has one chord <5, 28>
- <7, 27, 15, 25> has one chord <7, 15>
- <8, 21, 22, 4> has one chord <8, 22>
- <13, 25, 8, 21> has one chord <13, 8>
- <14, 1, 12, 17> has one chord <14, 12>
- <16, 22, 8, 25> has one chord <16, 22>
- <18, 29, 15, 25> has one chord <18, 15>
- <20, 25, 13, 26> has one chord <20, 13>
- <24, 26, 19, 0> has one chord <24, 19>
- <26, 5, 0, 19> has one chord <26, 0>
- <28, 16, 22, 8> has one chord <28, 22>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [16] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
