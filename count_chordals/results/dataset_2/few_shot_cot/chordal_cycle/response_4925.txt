Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (3, 6, 24, 2, 12, 7)
- (3, 18, 23, 25, 28, 26)
- (3, 18, 23, 4, 10, 15)
- (3, 6, 8, 21, 7, 12)
- (9, 4, 23, 18, 17, 20)
- (9, 4, 10, 15, 26, 22)
- (9, 16, 11, 14, 7, 12)
- (9, 22, 26, 28, 25, 23)
- (4, 28, 25, 23, 18, 3)
- (4, 28, 26, 15, 10, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle (9, 4, 23, 18, 17, 20) has a chord (4, 18)
- Cycle (4, 28, 26, 15, 10, 2) has a chord (28, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [8] chordless cycles found.

List of unique chordal 4-cycle:
<9, 16, 11, 14>
<9, 22, 26, 28>
<3, 18, 23, 25>
<3, 18, 23, 4>
<4, 28, 25, 23>
<3, 6, 24, 2>
<3, 6, 8, 21>
<9, 4, 10, 15>
