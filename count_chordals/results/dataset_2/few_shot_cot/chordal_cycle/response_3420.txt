Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- (13, 22, 7, 21, 9, 26, 6)
- (13, 22, 7, 21, 9, 2, 3, 25)
- (13, 22, 7, 10, 2, 3, 25)
- (13, 22, 7, 10, 2, 9, 26, 28)
- (13, 22, 25, 29, 17)
- (13, 22, 25, 29, 24, 20, 17)
- (13, 22, 25, 29, 24, 5, 28, 16)
- (13, 22, 25, 3, 24, 20, 17)
- (13, 22, 25, 3, 24, 5, 28, 16)
- (13, 22, 0, 4, 12)
- (13, 22, 0, 4, 12)
- (13, 22, 0, 8, 16)
- (13, 22, 17, 14)
- (13, 22, 17, 20, 24, 5)
- (13, 22, 17, 20, 24, 3, 25)
- (13, 22, 17, 20, 24, 29, 25)
- (13, 22, 17, 20, 24, 3, 2, 9)
- (13, 22, 17, 20, 24, 29, 25, 15)
- (13, 22, 17, 20, 24, 3, 2, 9, 26)

Step 2:
- The cycle (13, 22, 7, 21, 9, 26, 6) has a chord: (21, 26)
- The cycle (13, 22, 7, 21, 9, 2, 3, 25) has a chord: (9, 3)
- The cycle (13, 22, 17, 14) has a chord: (22, 14)
- The cycle (13, 22, 17, 20, 24, 5, 28, 16) has a chord: (22, 16)

Step 3: 
The number of chordless cycles found is [16].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <13, 22, 7, 21, 9, 26, 6>
- <13, 22, 7, 21, 9, 2, 3, 25>
- <13, 22, 17, 14>
- <13, 22, 17, 20, 24, 5, 28, 16>
