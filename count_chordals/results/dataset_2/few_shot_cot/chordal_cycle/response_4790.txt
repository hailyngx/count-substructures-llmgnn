Response:
Step 1: 
Possible cycles with 4 or more nodes are: 
- Cycle with nodes 0-6-4-12-0
- Cycle with nodes 0-6-4-10-1-13-0
- Cycle with nodes 0-6-14-7-5-2-3-0
- Cycle with nodes 1-10-11-3-2-1
- Cycle with nodes 1-10-8-9-11-1
- Cycle with nodes 3-2-7-14-13-0-3
- Cycle with nodes 4-10-8-5-7-14-12-4
- Cycle with nodes 4-10-8-9-11-3-2-4
- Cycle with nodes 6-0-3-2-7-14-6
- Cycle with nodes 7-14-12-4-6-0-13-7
- Cycle with nodes 7-14-13-2-5-8-10-7

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 0-6-4-12-0 has a chord (4, 12)
- Cycle 0-6-4-10-1-13-0 has a chord (1, 10)
- Cycle 0-6-14-7-5-2-3-0 has a chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 1-10-11-3-2-1 has a chord (3, 11)
- Cycle 1-10-8-9-11-1 has a chord (8, 9)
- Cycle 3-2-7-14-13-0-3 has a chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 4-10-8-5-7-14-12-4 has a chord (5, 12)
- Cycle 4-10-8-9-11-3-2-4 has a chord (3, 10)
- Cycle 6-0-3-2-7-14-6 has a chord (0, 2)
- Cycle 7-14-12-4-6-0-13-7 has a chord (4, 14)
- Cycle 7-14-13-2-5-8-10-7 has a chord (2, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found in this graph, so the final count is [11].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 4, 6, 12, 0>
<0, 6, 14, 7, 5, 2, 3, 0>
<4, 10, 8, 9, 11, 3, 2, 4>
<0, 6, 4, 10, 1, 13, 0>
<1, 10, 11, 3, 2, 1>
<7, 14, 12, 4, 6, 0, 13, 7>
<1, 10, 8, 9, 11, 1>
<7, 14, 13, 2, 5, 8, 10, 7>
<4, 10, 8, 5, 7, 14, 12, 4>
<3, 2, 7, 14, 13, 0, 3>
<0, 6, 3, 2, 7, 14, 0>
