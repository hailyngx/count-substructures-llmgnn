Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 10, 23, 24> (Chord: 23-24)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, 4, 18, 20> (Chord: 4-18)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 20, 18, 10> (Chord: 5-18)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, 13, 10, 18> (Chord: 10-18)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <8, 12, 28, 11> (Chord: 12-28)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, 15, 21, 6> (Chord: 15-21)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <12, 25, 8, 21> (Chord: 12-21)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <13, 7, 21, 6> (Chord: 7-21)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <27, 17, 6, 21> (Chord: 17-21)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 55 cycles in total, out of which 9 are chordal. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is 55 - 9 = 46.

Hence, the final count is [46].
