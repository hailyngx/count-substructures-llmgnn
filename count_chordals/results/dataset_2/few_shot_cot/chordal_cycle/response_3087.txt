Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 13) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 14) (3, 12) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 12) (7, 10) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 10) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 14) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (14, 0) (14, 11) (11, 5) (11, 6) (11, 14) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 12) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 14
Node 1 is connected to node 10, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 12, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 14, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, 2, 12, 11, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 14, 11, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 12, and node 10
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 2, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 14
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, 2, 13, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 12
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 3, 12, 2, 0, and node 11

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 9, 6, 14, 0> (length 6)
- Cycle 2: <1, 10, 7, 12, 2, 5, 9, 0, 1> (length 8)

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 2 has one chord: Edge (1, 10) is the chord.

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: 
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 10, 7, 12, 2, 5, 9, 0, 1> with chord (1, 10). 
Therefore, the count of chordless cycles is [0].
