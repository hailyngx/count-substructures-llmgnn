Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 5, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 8, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 3, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 8, 7, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 2, 1, 4, 2>
- Cycle 5: <2, 1, 7, 3, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 4, 5, 8, 2>
- Cycle 7: <5, 8, 7, 3, 5>
- Cycle 8: <3, 7, 1, 4, 3>
- Cycle 9: <6, 9, 8, 5, 6>
- Cycle 10: <6, 7, 0, 9, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Only Cycle 3: <0, 5, 8, 7, 0> has exactly one chord (5, 2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle in the graph, so the final count is [1].
