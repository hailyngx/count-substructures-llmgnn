Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 8, 3, 5>
- Cycle 2: <6, 5, 2, 7, 6>
- Cycle 3: <4, 6, 1, 7, 4>
- Cycle 4: <6, 5, 3, 7, 6>
- Cycle 5: <5, 3, 6, 4, 5>
- Cycle 6: <5, 7, 2, 1, 5>
- Cycle 7: <7, 5, 3, 8, 7>
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 2, 7, 3>
- Cycle 9: <9, 5, 3, 8, 9>
- Cycle 10: <0, 9, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle 11: <4, 0, 1, 6, 4>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 8, 3, 5> has the chord (9, 3)
- Cycle 2: <6, 5, 2, 7, 6> has the chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 3: <4, 6, 1, 7, 4> has the chord (6, 1)
- Cycle 4: <6, 5, 3, 7, 6> has the chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 5: <5, 3, 6, 4, 5> has the chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 6: <5, 7, 2, 1, 5> has the chord (7, 2)
- Cycle 7: <7, 5, 3, 8, 7> has the chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 2, 7, 3> has the chord (5, 2)
- Cycle 9: <9, 5, 3, 8, 9> has the chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 10: <0, 9, 5, 7, 0> has the chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 11: <4, 0, 1, 6, 4> has the chord (0, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
