Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 10, 15, 6>
- <0, 10, 15, 3>
- <0, 10, 2, 13>
- <0, 10, 2, 14, 1, 12, 6>
- <1, 12, 6, 15>
- <1, 12, 6, 0, 10, 2, 13>
- <2, 13, 8, 16, 7, 14>
- <5, 8, 13, 3>
- <5, 8, 13, 2>
- <5, 11, 1, 12, 6>
- <5, 11, 1, 14, 2, 13>
- <6, 15, 3, 13>
- <6, 15, 10, 2, 13>
- <7, 14, 1, 12, 6>
- <8, 13, 3, 15>
- <8, 13, 3, 13>
- <8, 13, 2, 14>
- <8, 16, 7, 14>
- <9, 0, 10, 2>
- <9, 11, 1, 12>
- <9, 11, 1, 14>
- <9, 16, 7, 14>
- <10, 2, 13, 3>
- <10, 2, 13, 8>
- <10, 2, 14, 1>
- <10, 15, 6, 12>
- <11, 1, 12, 6>
- <11, 1, 14, 2>
- <11, 5, 8, 13>
- <11, 9, 0, 10>
- <12, 1, 14, 2>
- <12, 4, 19, 9>
- <12, 6, 15, 3>
- <13, 2, 10, 15>
- <13, 2, 14, 1>
- <13, 3, 15, 6>
- <13, 3, 8, 16>
- <14, 2, 10, 15>
- <14, 7, 16, 9>
- <15, 3, 13, 8>
- <15, 6, 12, 1>
  
Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 10, 15, 6> has 1 chord: (10, 15)
- <0, 10, 15, 3> has 1 chord: (0, 6)
- <1, 12, 6, 15> has 1 chord: (6, 12)
- <2, 13, 8, 16, 7, 14> has 1 chord: (13, 8)
- <5, 8, 13, 3> has 1 chord: (5, 13)
- <5, 11, 1, 12, 6> has 1 chord: (1, 12)
- <6, 15, 3, 13> has 1 chord: (3, 13)
- <8, 13, 3, 15> has 1 chord: (8, 15)
- <8, 16, 7, 14> has 1 chord: (16, 7)
- <9, 11, 1, 12> has 1 chord: (11, 1)
- <10, 2, 13, 3> has 1 chord: (2, 13)
- <11, 1, 12, 6> has 1 chord: (1, 12)
- <12, 1, 14, 2> has 1 chord: (14, 2)
- <13, 3, 15, 6> has 1 chord: (3, 15)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have a total of [0].
