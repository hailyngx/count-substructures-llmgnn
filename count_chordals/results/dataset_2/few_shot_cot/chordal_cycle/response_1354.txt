58. <13, 7, 8, 12>
59. <13, 7, 8, 13>
60. <13, 14, 2, 0>

Step 2:
Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle, we find that the following cycles have exactly one chord:
1. <3, 11, 5, 1> (Chord: 1, 5)
2. <4, 13, 11, 5> (Chord: 4, 11)
3. <7, 3, 1, 6> (Chord: 1, 6)
4. <8, 13, 4, 9> (Chord: 4, 9)
5. <11, 5, 1, 3> (Chord: 1, 3)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found results in [55].
