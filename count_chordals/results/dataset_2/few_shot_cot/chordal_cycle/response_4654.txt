Response:
Let's find the chordal 4-cycles in the given graph step-by-step:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 9, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 3, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 4, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 4, 13, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 3, 6, 14, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 3, 12, 7, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 13, 5, 8, 0>
- Cycle 8: <1, 9, 11, 4, 1>
- Cycle 9: <3, 1, 9, 11, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 1, 4, 13, 3>
- Cycle 11: <3, 6, 8, 12, 3>
- Cycle 12: <3, 6, 14, 4, 3>
- Cycle 13: <10, 5, 13, 7, 10>
- Cycle 14: <10, 7, 12, 6, 10>
- Cycle 15: <11, 9, 8, 12, 11>
- Cycle 16: <11, 9, 1, 4, 11>
- Cycle 17: <12, 3, 1, 4, 12>
- Cycle 18: <12, 3, 6, 14, 12>
- Cycle 19: <12, 10, 5, 13, 12>
- Cycle 20: <12, 7, 13, 4, 12>
- Cycle 21: <13, 5, 8, 12, 13>
- Cycle 22: <13, 7, 14, 4, 13>
- Cycle 23: <14, 9, 1, 0, 14>
- Cycle 24: <14, 9, 11, 4, 14>
- Cycle 25: <14, 7, 13, 4, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- From the listed cycles, the following cycles have exactly one chord:
  <0, 1, 9, 8, 0> with chord (1, 9)
  <0, 3, 12, 7, 0> with chord (3, 12)
  <0, 1, 4, 13, 0> with chord (1, 13)
  <10, 5, 13, 7, 10> with chord (5, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 9, 8>
- <0, 3, 12, 7>
- <0, 1, 4, 13>
- <5, 10, 13, 7>
