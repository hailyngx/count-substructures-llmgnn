Response:
Step 1:  
The cycle of length 4 in the graph is:
- (4, 10, 6, 3, 4)

Step 2:  
For the cycle (4, 10, 6, 3, 4), the chord is the edge connecting the non-adjacent nodes 10 and 3, which is the edge (10, 3).

Step 3:  
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, which is the cycle <4, 10, 6, 3> with the chord (10, 3).

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
