Response:
Let's count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <11, 16, 25, 4> with chords (25, 16)
- Cycle 2: <0, 19, 6, 3> with chords (19, 0)
- Cycle 3: <0, 19, 13, 1> with chords (19, 0)
- Cycle 4: <22, 18, 5, 11> with chords (18, 22)
- Cycle 5: <22, 18, 1, 17> with chords (18, 22)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: <11, 16, 25, 4> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (25, 16)
- Cycle 2: <0, 19, 6, 3> is not a chordal 4-cycle (more than one chord)
- Cycle 3: <0, 19, 13, 1> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (19, 0)
    > Eliminate cycle 2 as it is not chordal
- Cycle 4: <22, 18, 5, 11> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (18, 22)
- Cycle 5: <22, 18, 1, 17> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (18, 22)
    > Eliminate cycle 2 as it is not chordal

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
