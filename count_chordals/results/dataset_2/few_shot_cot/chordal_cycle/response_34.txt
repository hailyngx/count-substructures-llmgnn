Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycle with only one chord is:
- <0, (7, 15), 20>
- <6, (9, 8), 14>
- <9, (6, 29), 5>
- <20, (15, 13), 1>
- <25, (19, 16), 22>
- <22, (4, 22), 21>
- <16, (12, 28), 8>
- <3, (11, 8), 14>
- <21, (13, 29), 5>

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final count is [9].
