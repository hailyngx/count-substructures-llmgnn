Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: <1, 19, 10, 24>
- Cycle 2: <1, 19, 29, 10>
- Cycle 3: <6, 12, 9, 4>
- Cycle 4: <6, 12, 18, 25>
- Cycle 5: <6, 12, 9, 28>
- Cycle 6: <6, 12, 18, 17>
- Cycle 7: <16, 11, 14, 24>
- Cycle 8: <16, 11, 23, 7>
- Cycle 9: <16, 20, 3, 28>
- Cycle 10: <16, 20, 2, 9>
- Cycle 11: <16, 20, 3, 7>
- Cycle 12: <16, 13, 26, 17>
- Cycle 13: <16, 13, 21, 4>
- Cycle 14: <16, 14, 24, 17>
- Cycle 15: <5, 10, 24, 14>
- Cycle 16: <5, 10, 19, 1>

- Cycle 18: <5, 22, 15, 2>
- Cycle 19: <5, 22, 15, 28>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found: <16, (13, 21), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [18].
