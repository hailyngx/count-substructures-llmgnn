Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 1) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 2) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (11, 6) (11, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 3) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 1) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 3) (3, 11) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 14) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 1) (14, 5) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 3) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 13)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <4, 5, 1, 9>
- Cycle 2: <4, 5, 12, 0>
- Cycle 3: <4, 5, 9, 10>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 14, 11>
- Cycle 5: <1, 12, 0, 11>
- Cycle 6: <1, 12, 0, 6>
- Cycle 7: <1, 12, 0, 11>
- Cycle 8: <1, 9, 5, 13>
- Cycle 9: <1, 9, 10, 11>
- Cycle 10: <1, 9, 10, 6>
- Cycle 11: <1, 9, 10, 2>
- Cycle 12: <1, 9, 13, 5>
- Cycle 13: <5, 9, 8, 14>
- Cycle 14: <5, 9, 10, 6>
- Cycle 15: <5, 12, 0, 11>
- Cycle 16: <5, 12, 0, 6>
- Cycle 17: <5, 12, 0, 11>
- Cycle 18: <5, 13, 1, 9>
- Cycle 19: <5, 13, 9, 10>
- Cycle 20: <9, 10, 6, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, 5, 1, 9> has one chord: (4, 1)
- <4, 5, 12, 0> has one chord: (5, 0)
- <1, 5, 14, 11> has one chord: (5, 11)
- <1, 9, 5, 13> has one chord: (1, 5)
- <9, 10, 6, 11> has one chord: (10, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 20 cycles found, out of which 15 have exactly one chord. So the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
