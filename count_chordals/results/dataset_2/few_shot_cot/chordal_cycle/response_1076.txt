Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 7, 3, 1, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 7, 3, 9, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 7, 9, 1)
- Cycle 4: (8, 1, 3, 7, 8)
- Cycle 5: (0, 5, 8, 1, 0)
- Cycle 6: (6, 4, 8, 1, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 4, 8, 5, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle <0, 7, 3, 1, 0> has a chord, resulting in the chordal 4-cycle <0, 1, (3, 7), 0>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

The number of chordless cycles found is [6].
