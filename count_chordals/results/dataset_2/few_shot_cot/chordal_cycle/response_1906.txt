Response:
Step 1: List of cycles with length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 1, 4, 7) with edges (0, 5), (5, 1), (1, 4), (4, 7), (7, 4), (4, 3), and (3, 7)
- Cycle 2: (0, 8, 7, 4, 1) with edges (0, 8), (8, 7), (7, 4), (4, 1), (1, 5), and (5, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 8, 9, 7, 4) with edges (0, 8), (8, 9), (9, 7), (7, 4), (4, 3), and (3, 4)
- Cycle 4: (0, 9, 7, 4, 1) with edges (0, 9), (9, 7), (7, 4), (4, 1), (1, 5), and (5, 0)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 7, 9, 8) with edges (1, 4), (4, 7), (7, 9), (9, 8), (8, 3), and (3, 8)
- Cycle 6: (1, 6, 0, 5, 4) with edges (1, 6), (6, 0), (0, 5), (5, 4), (4, 3), and (3, 4)
- Cycle 7: (2, 3, 8, 9, 7) with edges (2, 3), (3, 8), (8, 9), (9, 7), (7, 4), and (4, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 4, 7, 9, 8) with edges (2, 4), (4, 7), (7, 9), (9, 8), (8, 0), and (0, 8)
  
Step 2: Checking for chords:
- For Cycle 1: (0, 5, 1, 4, 7), possible chord: (5, 7) - Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (5, 7), 4>
- For Cycle 2: (0, 8, 7, 4, 1), possible chord: (8, 4) - Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, (8, 4), 1>
- For Cycle 3: (0, 8, 9, 7, 4), possible chord: (8, 7) - Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, (8, 7), 4>
- For Cycle 4: (0, 9, 7, 4, 1), possible chord: (9, 4) - Chordal 4-cycle found: <4, (9, 4), 1>
- For Cycle 5: (1, 4, 7, 9, 8), possible chord: (4, 9) - Chordal 4-cycle found: <5, (4, 9), 8>
- For Cycle 6: (1, 6, 0, 5, 4), possible chord: (6, 5) - Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (6, 5), 1>
- For Cycle 7: (2, 3, 8, 9, 7), possible chord: (3, 9) - Chordal 4-cycle found: <7, (3, 9), 8>
- For Cycle 8: (2, 4, 7, 9, 8), possible chord: (4, 9) - Chordal 4-cycle found: <8, (4, 9), 2>

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: [8]
