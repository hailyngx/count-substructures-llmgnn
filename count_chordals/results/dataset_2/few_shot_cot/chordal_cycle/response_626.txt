Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 0

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle with vertices (1, 6, 7, 4, 1)
- Cycle with vertices (1, 4, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle with vertices (1, 4, 7, 8, 1)
- Cycle with vertices (1, 4, 0, 2, 1)
- Cycle with vertices (1, 0, 2, 8, 1)
- Cycle with vertices (4, 7, 8, 5, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- In cycle (1, 6, 7, 4, 1), the chord is (1, 4).
- In cycle (1, 4, 5, 2, 1), the chord is (1, 5).
- In cycle (1, 4, 7, 8, 1), the chord is (1, 8).
- In cycle (1, 4, 0, 2, 1), the chord is (1, 2).
- In cycle (1, 0, 2, 8, 1), the chord is (1, 2).
- In cycle (4, 7, 8, 5, 4), the chord is (4, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, 6, 7, 4>
