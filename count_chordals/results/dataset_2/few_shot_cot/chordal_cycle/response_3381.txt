Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <7, 5, 13, 4>
2. <0, 1, 9, 5>
3. <2, 3, 13, 5>
4. <12, 7, 5, 13>
5. <14, 16, 11, 19>
6. <15, 12, 7, 5>
7. <18, 12, 7, 5>
8. <19, 11, 16, 14>
9. <19, 11, 16, 14, 15>
10. <19, 11, 16, 14, 8>

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:
1. <15, 12, 7, 5> with chord (12, 5)
2. <18, 12, 7, 5> with chord (12, 5)
3. <19, 11, 16, 14> with chord (11, 14)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [7]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycle found:
1. <15, 12, 7, 5> with one chord (12, 5)
2. <18, 12, 7, 5> with one chord (12, 5)
3. <19, 11, 16, 14> with one chord (11, 14)
