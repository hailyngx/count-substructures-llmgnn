Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 7, 4, 5>
- <1, 4, 11, 10>
- <1, 4, 9, 9>
- <2, 10, 11, 9>
- <2, 10, 1, 4>
- <2, 10, 1, 9>
- <2, 10, 14, 13>
- <2, 8, 12, 6>
- <2, 8, 12, 7>
- <2, 8, 13, 9>
- <2, 5, 4, 6>
- <2, 5, 4, 7>
- <2, 3, 7, 4>
- <2, 3, 7, 12>
- <2, 3, 7, 0>
- <2, 0, 7, 4>
- <2, 0, 7, 12>
- <5, 4, 7, 6>
- <6, 7, 4, 11>
- <6, 7, 13, 8>
- <6, 12, 8, 10>
- <6, 12, 8, 13>
- <6, 12, 7, 4>
- <7, 4, 11, 10>
  
Step 2:  
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:  
- Chordal 4-cycles found:  
    - <2, 10, 1, 4>  
    - <2, 10, 1, 9>  
    - <2, 5, 4, 6>  
    - <6, 7, 4, 11>  

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordless cycles:  
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found.  
So, the number of chordless 4-cycles is [20].
