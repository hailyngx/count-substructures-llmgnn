Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 16, 5, 29>
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 28, 15>
- Cycle 3: <2, 18, 6, 22>
- Cycle 4: <4, 11, 9, 20>
- Cycle 5: <5, 0, 2, 25>
- Cycle 6: <6, 22, 13, 28>
- Cycle 7: <7, 14, 3, 1>
- Cycle 8: <8, 23, 13, 22>
- Cycle 9: <9, 20, 25, 2>
- Cycle 10: <10, 5, 29, 23>
- Cycle 11: <11, 4, 13, 28>
- Cycle 12: <12, 10, 21, 18>
- Cycle 13: <15, 11, 4, 13>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord: <5, 29>
- Cycle 2 has chord: <3, 28>
- Cycle 3 has chord: <18, 22>
- Cycle 4 has chord: <11, 20>
- Cycle 5 has chord: <0, 2>
- Cycle 6 has chord: <13, 28>
- Cycle 7 has chord: <3, 1>
- Cycle 8 has chord: <13, 22>
- Cycle 9 has chord: <9, 25>
- Cycle 10 has chord: <5, 29>
- Cycle 11 has chord: <11, 13>
- Cycle 12 has chord: <10, 21>
- Cycle 13 has chord: <11, 13>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- The chordless cycles are: Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 7, and Cycle 12
- Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [4].
