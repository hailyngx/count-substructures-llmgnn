Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 2, 9, 1, 14, 5, 7, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 13, 4, 8, 18, 5, 14, 1, 9, 2, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 13, 4, 16, 14, 5, 7, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 13, 4, 16, 11, 17, 15, 1, 14, 5, 7, 0)
- Cycle 5: (2, 9, 1, 14, 16, 4, 13, 0, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 9, 1, 15, 17, 11, 16, 4, 13, 0, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 10, 8, 18, 5, 14, 1, 9, 6, 12, 17, 11, 16, 4, 13, 0, 2)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 10, 2, 0, 7, 5, 14, 16, 11, 17, 15, 1, 9, 6, 12, 19, 3, 4)
- Cycle 9: (6, 9, 2, 10, 8, 4, 16, 11, 17, 15, 1, 14, 5, 18, 13, 0, 7, 5, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 12, 19, 16, 14, 5, 7, 0, 13, 4, 8, 10, 2, 9, 11, 17, 15, 1, 6)
- Cycle 11: (8, 10, 2, 0, 7, 5, 14, 16, 11, 17, 15, 1, 9, 6, 12, 19, 16)
- Cycle 12: (8, 18, 6, 9, 1, 15, 17, 11, 16, 14, 5, 7, 0, 13, 4, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <2, 9, 1, 14>
- Chordal Cycle 2: <0, 13, 4, 16>
- Chordal Cycle 3: <4, 16, 11, 17>
- Chordal Cycle 4: <9, 1, 14, 16>
- Chordal Cycle 5: <1, 9, 2, 0>
- Chordal Cycle 6: <1, 15, 17, 11>
- Chordal Cycle 7: <8, 18, 5, 14>
- Chordal Cycle 8: <16, 4, 13, 0>
- Chordal Cycle 9: <2, 10, 8, 4>
- Chordal Cycle 10: <6, 12, 19, 16>
- Chordal Cycle 11: <1, 15, 17, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count is [0].
