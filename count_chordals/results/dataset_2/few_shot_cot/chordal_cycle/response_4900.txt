Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (1, 7, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 1, 7, 4, 2)
- Cycle 3: (3, 4, 7, 5, 3)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 0, 6, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 4, 7, 1, 5)
- Cycle 6: (6, 4, 7, 5, 6)
- Cycle 7: (7, 5, 8, 1, 7)
- Cycle 8: (8, 1, 3, 2, 8)
- Cycle 9: (9, 4, 7, 0, 9)

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <4, (3, 1), 7>.

Step 3:
Since we found 1 chordal 4-cycle, the count of chordless cycles found is [9].
