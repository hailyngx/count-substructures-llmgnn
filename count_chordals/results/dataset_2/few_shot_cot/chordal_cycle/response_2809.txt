Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <2, 9, 14, 13>
- <3, 10, 6, 14>
- <3, 4, 17, 13>
- <4, 19, 1, 14>
- <5, 9, 13, 14>
- <7, 18, 15, 16>
- <8, 19, 4, 17>
- <9, 5, 11, 18>
- <9, 13, 17, 15>
- <12, 8, 19, 4>
- <16, 9, 13, 14>

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <2, 9, 14, 13, (9, 14)>
- <3, 10, 6, 14, (10, 6)>
- <3, 4, 17, 13, (4, 13)>
- <4, 19, 1, 14, (19, 14)>
- <5, 9, 13, 14, (9, 14)>
- <7, 18, 15, 16, (18, 15)>
- <8, 19, 4, 17, (19, 4)>
- <9, 5, 11, 18, (5, 18)>
- <9, 13, 17, 15, (13, 15)>
- <12, 8, 19, 4, (8, 19)>
- <16, 9, 13, 14, (9, 14)>

Step 3:
There are [10] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
