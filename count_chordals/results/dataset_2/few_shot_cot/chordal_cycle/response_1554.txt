Response:
First, let's analyze the given graph to find chordal 4-cycles.

Step 1: Identify all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- From the given adjacency list, we can list down the cycles of length 4:
  - Cycle 1: 0 - 7 - 1 - 4 - 12 - 0
  - Cycle 2: 7 - 1 - 6 - 10 - 14 - 5 - 7
  - Cycle 3: 5 - 7 - 2 - 6 - 3 - 13 - 9 - 4 - 5
  - Cycle 4: 2 - 12 - 4 - 9 - 13 - 2
  - Cycle 5: 3 - 8 - 13 - 2 - 6 - 3
  - Cycle 6: 9 - 13 - 7 - 5 - 14 - 10 - 6 - 9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Checking the above cycles, we find that Cycle 3: 5 - 7 - 2 - 6 - 3 - 13 - 9 - 4 - 5 contains exactly one chord 2-4 (connecting non-adjacent nodes).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- As we found one chordal 4-cycle, the count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<5, 2, 6, 4>
