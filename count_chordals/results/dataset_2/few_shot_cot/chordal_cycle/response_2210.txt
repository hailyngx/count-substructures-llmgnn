Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: <0, 7, 5, 1, 4, 9>
        - Cycle 2: <0, 7, 6, 9, 4, 1>
        - Cycle 3: <0, 7, 6, 5, 1, 4>
        - Cycle 4: <0, 7, 5, 6, 9, 4>
        - Cycle 5: <1, 4, 9, 6, 7, 0>
        - Cycle 6: <1, 4, 9, 8, 3, 0>
        - Cycle 7: <1, 4, 9, 8, 2, 7>
        - Cycle 8: <1, 4, 9, 6, 5, 7>
        - Cycle 9: <1, 4, 9, 8, 6, 7>
        - Cycle 10: <2, 5, 7, 0, 3, 8>
        - Cycle 11: <2, 5, 7, 0, 1, 4>
        - Cycle 12: <2, 5, 7, 6, 9, 4>
        - Cycle 13: <2, 5, 6, 7, 0, 3>
        - Cycle 14: <2, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1>
        - Cycle 15: <3, 8, 9, 4, 1, 5>
        - Cycle 16: <3, 8, 9, 4, 1, 7>
        - Cycle 17: <5, 1, 4, 9, 6, 7>
        
Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 7, 6, 9, (4, 1)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 4, 9, 6, (7, 0)>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 4, 9, (8, 3), 0>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, 5, 7, (0, 3), 8>
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 13 chordless 4-cycles in the graph.
        
Putting the final number inside brackets: [13].
