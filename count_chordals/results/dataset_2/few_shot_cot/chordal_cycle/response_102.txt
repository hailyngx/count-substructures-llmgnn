Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. <0, 1, 4, 5>
2. <0, 1, 18, 2>
3. <0, 1, 18, 2, 16>
4. <0, 15, 17, 5>
5. <0, 15, 17, 5, 4>
6. <0, 15, 17, 5, 11>
7. <0, 15, 9, 3>
8. <0, 15, 9, 3, 12>
9. <0, 12, 3, 6>
10. <0, 12, 3, 9>
11. <1, 4, 7, 14>
12. <1, 4, 7, 14, 13>
13. <1, 18, 2, 16, 10>
14. <3, 6, 5, 4>
15. <3, 6, 5, 11>
16. <3, 9, 15, 17>
17. <3, 9, 15, 11>
18. <3, 9, 14, 7>
19. <4, 5, 6, 3>
20. <4, 5, 11, 15>
21. <5, 17, 15, 11>
22. <5, 19, 8, 16>
23. <5, 19, 8, 16, 10>
24. <5, 19, 11, 12>
25. <5, 19, 11, 15>
26. <6, 3, 9, 15>
27. <9, 15, 17, 5>
28. <9, 15, 0, 1>
29. <9, 15, 0, 12>
30. <9, 14, 7, 4>
31. <11, 5, 4, 1>
32. <11, 5, 19, 8>
33. <11, 5, 19, 13>
34. <11, 5, 19, 8, 16>
35. <11, 5, 19, 13, 14>
36. <11, 15, 0, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. <0, 1, 4, 5> (Chord: 1, 5)
2. <0, 15, 17, 5> (Chord: 15, 5)
3. <0, 15, 9, 3> (Chord: 15, 3)
4. <0, 12, 3, 6> (Chord: 12, 6)
5. <1, 4, 7, 14> (Chord: 4, 14)
6. <3, 6, 5, 4> (Chord: 6, 5)
7. <3, 9, 15, 17> (Chord: 9, 17)
8. <3, 9, 14, 7> (Chord: 9, 7)
9. <4, 5, 6, 3> (Chord: 5, 3)
10. <5, 17, 15, 11> (Chord: 17, 15)
11. <5, 19, 8, 16> (Chord: 19, 16)
12. <6, 3, 9, 15> (Chord: 3, 9)
13. <9, 14, 7, 4> (Chord: 14, 4)
14. <11, 5, 4, 1> (Chord: 5, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 14 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [14].
