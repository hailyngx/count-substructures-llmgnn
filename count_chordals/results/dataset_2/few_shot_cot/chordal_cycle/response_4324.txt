Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with all edges existing:
- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 6, 9, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 3, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 4, 6, 9, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 7, 3, 5>
- Cycle 5: <9, 6, 1, 5, 9>
- Cycle 6: <9, 7, 2, 6, 9>
- Cycle 7: <6, 1, 9, 4, 6>
- Cycle 8: <1, 5, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle 9: <3, 5, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle 10: <4, 5, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle 11: <8, 3, 7, 2, 8>
- Cycle 12: <7, 9, 5, 1, 7>
- Cycle 13: <2, 6, 1, 5, 2>
- Cycle 14: <0, 4, 9, 5, 0>
- Cycle 15: <0, 2, 6, 1, 0>
- Cycle 16: <0, 7, 3, 5, 0>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal cycle 1: <5, 1, (6, 9), 5>
- Chordal cycle 2: <5, (3, 6), 1, 5>
- Chordal cycle 3: <5, 4, (6, 9), 5>
- Chordal cycle 4: <5, 9, 7, (3, 5)>
- Chordal cycle 5: <9, 6, (1, 5), 9>
- Chordal cycle 6: <9, 7, (2, 6), 9>
- Chordal cycle 7: <6, 1, (9, 4), 6>
- Chordal cycle 8: <1, (5, 9), 6, 1>
- Chordal cycle 9: <3, 5, (9, 7), 3>
- Chordal cycle 10: <4, 5, (9, 6), 4>
- Chordal cycle 11: <8, 3, (7, 2), 8>
- Chordal cycle 12: <7, 9, (5, 1), 7>
- Chordal cycle 13: <2, 6, (1, 5), 2>
- Chordal cycle 14: <0, 4, (9, 5), 0>
- Chordal cycle 15: <0, 2, (6, 1), 0>
- Chordal cycle 16: <0, 7, (3, 5), 0>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
