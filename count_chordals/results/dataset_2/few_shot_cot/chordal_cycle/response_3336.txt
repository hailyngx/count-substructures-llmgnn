Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <1, 29, 18, 11>
- Cycle 2: <1, 29, 18, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 18, 11, 17>
- Cycle 4: <1, 18, 0, 21>
- Cycle 5: <1, 18, 29, 18>
- Cycle 6: <1, 18, 11, 17>
- Cycle 7: <18, 0, 21, 13>
- Cycle 8: <18, 0, 21, 23>
- Cycle 9: <18, 0, 20, 14>
- Cycle 10: <18, 1, 29, 18>
- Cycle 11: <18, 1, 29, 18>
- Cycle 12: <18, 1, 29, 18>
- Cycle 13: <18, 1, 29, 18>
- Cycle 14: <18, 1, 29, 18>
- Cycle 15: <18, 1, 29, 18>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 29, 18, 11>, Chord: (17, 25)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 29, 18, 0>, Chord: (21, 20)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <18, 0, 21, 13>, Chord: (14, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
As there are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, the number of chordless 4-cycles is [15].
