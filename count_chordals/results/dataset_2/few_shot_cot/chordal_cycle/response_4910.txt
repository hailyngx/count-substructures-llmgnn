Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
<0, 8, 1, 13, 0>  
<1, 5, 13, 0, 1>  
<2, 11, 10, 3, 2>  
<2, 6, 10, 3, 2>  
<2, 4, 9, 3, 2>  
<2, 4, 0, 8, 2>  
<4, 9, 3, 13, 4>  
<4, 0, 13, 12, 4>  
<5, 13, 12, 8, 5>  
<6, 10, 11, 2, 6>  
<6, 10, 3, 9, 6>  
<6, 14, 9, 4, 6>  
<6, 14, 0, 8, 6>  
<7, 5, 13, 1, 7>  
<7, 1, 14, 9, 7>  
<7, 6, 10, 11, 7>  

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
In the cycle <0, 8, 1, 13, 0>, the chord is (8, 13).
In the cycle <1, 5, 13, 0, 1>, the chord is (5, 0).
In the cycle <2, 11, 10, 3, 2>, the chord is (11, 3).
In the cycle <2, 6, 10, 3, 2>, the chord is (6, 3).
In the cycle <2, 4, 9, 3, 2>, the chord is (4, 9).
In the cycle <2, 4, 0, 8, 2>, the chord is (4, 8).
In the cycle <4, 9, 3, 13, 4>, the chord is (9, 13).
In the cycle <4, 0, 13, 12, 4>, the chord is (0, 13).
In the cycle <5, 13, 12, 8, 5>, the chord is (13, 8).
In the cycle <6, 10, 11, 2, 6>, the chord is (10, 11).
In the cycle <6, 10, 3, 9, 6>, the chord is (10, 9).
In the cycle <6, 14, 9, 4, 6>, the chord is (14, 4).
In the cycle <6, 14, 0, 8, 6>, the chord is (14, 8).
In the cycle <7, 5, 13, 1, 7>, the chord is (5, 1).
In the cycle <7, 1, 14, 9, 7>, the chord is (1, 9).
In the cycle <7, 6, 10, 11, 7>, the chord is (6, 11).

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles:
[16]
