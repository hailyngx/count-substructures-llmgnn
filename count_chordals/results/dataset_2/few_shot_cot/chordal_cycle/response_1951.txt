Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4: 
- <0, 9, 1, 10>, 
- <0, 9, 5, 14>, 
- <1, 9, 5, 14>, 
- <1, 9, 0, 10>, 
- <2, 0, 10, 1>, 
- <3, 6, 14, 11>, 
- <3, 6, 19, 12>, 
- <3, 15, 16, 1>, 
- <3, 15, 8, 11>, 
- <4, 2, 0, 10>, 
- <6, 14, 11, 2>, 
- <6, 19, 12, 9>, 
- <7, 12, 9, 0>, 
- <7, 12, 13, 17>, 
- <8, 3, 6, 14>, 
- <8, 3, 15, 16>, 
- <11, 14, 5, 9>, 
- <11, 14, 6, 3>, 
- <15, 8, 11, 2>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles: 
- <0, 9, 1, 10, (16, 15)>
- <2, 0, 10, 1, (9, 11)>
- <3, 6, 19, 12, (7, 14)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [18].
