Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 6, 7>
- Cycle 3: <1, 5, 8, 2, 9>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 6, 7>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 8, 4>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 6, 4>
- Cycle 7: <1, 9, 4, 8>
- Cycle 8: <1, 9, 7, 6>
- Cycle 9: <2, 9, 4, 1>
- Cycle 10: <2, 9, 7, 6>
- Cycle 11: <4, 9, 2, 8>
- Cycle 12: <4, 9, 7, 6>
- Cycle 13: <6, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 14: <6, 5, 1, 9>
- Cycle 15: <6, 5, 8, 4>
- Cycle 16: <7, 6, 5, 1>
- Cycle 17: <7, 6, 4, 8>
- Cycle 18: <7, 6, 5, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 5, 8, 2, 9> (Chord: (8, 2))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 9, 4, 8> (Chord: (9, 4))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
