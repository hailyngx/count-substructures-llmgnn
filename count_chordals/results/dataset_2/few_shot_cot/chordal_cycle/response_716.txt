Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- <4, 7, 10, 19>
- <4, 7, 12, 2>
- <4, 7, 9, 17>
- <4, 9, 17, 5>
- <7, 12, 2, 11>
- <7, 10, 15, 19>
- <7, 19, 14, 16>
- <12, 2, 8, 1>
- <12, 3, 6, 11>
- <2, 8, 1, 6>
- <2, 11, 0, 5>
- <9, 17, 5, 0>
- <9, 3, 6, 11>
- <10, 15, 19, 14>
- <19, 14, 6, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <4, 7, 10, 19> has chord (7, 10) -> <4, 7, 10, 19, (7, 10)>
- <4, 7, 12, 2> has chord (7, 12) -> <4, 7, 12, 2, (7, 12)>
- <4, 7, 9, 17> has chord (7, 9) -> <4, 7, 9, 17, (7, 9)>
- <4, 9, 17, 5> has chord (9, 17) -> <4, 9, 17, 5, (9, 17)>
- <7, 12, 2, 11> has chord (12, 2) -> <7, 12, 2, 11, (12, 2)>
- <7, 10, 15, 19> has chord (10, 15) -> <7, 10, 15, 19, (10, 15)>
- <7, 19, 14, 16> has chord (19, 14) -> <7, 19, 14, 16, (19, 14)>
- <12, 2, 8, 1> has chord (2, 8) -> <12, 2, 8, 1, (2, 8)>
- <12, 3, 6, 11> has chord (3, 6) -> <12, 3, 6, 11, (3, 6)>
- <2, 8, 1, 6> has chord (8, 1) -> <2, 8, 1, 6, (8, 1)>
- <2, 11, 0, 5> has chord (11, 0) -> <2, 11, 0, 5, (11, 0)>
- <9, 17, 5, 0> has chord (17, 5) -> <9, 17, 5, 0, (17, 5)>
- <9, 3, 6, 11> has chord (3, 6) -> <9, 3, 6, 11, (3, 6)>
- <10, 15, 19, 14> has chord (15, 19) -> <10, 15, 19, 14, (15, 19)>
- <19, 14, 6, 1> has chord (14, 6) -> <19, 14, 6, 1, (14, 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 15 chordal 4-cycles in this graph, so the final count is [15].
