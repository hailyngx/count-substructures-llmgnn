Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 4, 8, 3, 0>
- <1, 9, 8, 4, 1>
- <2, 11, 10, 5, 13, 2>
- <3, 4, 14, 6, 11, 3>
- <5, 11, 10, 5>
- <6, 13, 5, 11, 6>
- <7, 8, 4, 0, 7>
- <12, 7, 8, 3, 14, 13, 12>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 8, 3, 0>: Chord = (4, 8) 
- <1, 9, 8, 4, 1>: Chord = (9, 4) 
- <2, 11, 10, 5, 13, 2>: No chord
- <3, 4, 14, 6, 11, 3>: Chord = (4, 6)
- <5, 11, 10, 5>: Chord = (11, 10)
- <6, 13, 5, 11, 6>: Chord = (13, 5)
- <7, 8, 4, 0, 7>: No chord
- <12, 7, 8, 3, 14, 13, 12>: No chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 3 chordless cycles, so the final count is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <2, 11, 10, 5, 13, 2>
