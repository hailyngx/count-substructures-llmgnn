Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 14) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 12) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (13, 3) (13, 2) (13, 10) (13, 0) (10, 13) (10, 6) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 14) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 2) (6, 10) (6, 7) (6, 12) (6, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 1) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 2) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 14) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 13, 6, 7, and node 14
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 11, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 13, 4, 12, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 11, 7, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 14, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 10, 7, 12, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, 12, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 14, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 13, and node 6
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 14
Node 12 is connected to node 1, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 2, 10, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 11, 4, 0, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
- One cycle with 4 nodes: <1, 5, 9, 4, 1> with chord (1, 9)
- One cycle with 4 nodes: <1, 12, 2, 14, 1> with chord (2, 12)
- One cycle with 4 nodes: <3, 7, 6, 12, 3> with chord (6, 12)
- One cycle with 4 nodes: <0, 9, 14, 2, 0> with chord (2, 14)

Step 2:
- After checking, we find that all 4-cycles have exactly one chord each.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
