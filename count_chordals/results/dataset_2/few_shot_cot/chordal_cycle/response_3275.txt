Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <5, 9, 0, 3, 5>
2. <5, 1, 7, 4, 6, 5>
3. <5, 3, 0, 9, 7, 1, 5>
4. <5, 8, 9, 7, 4, 6, 1, 5>
5. <9, 0, 3, 6, 4, 7, 9>
6. <6, 1, 7, 4, 8, 6>
7. <1, 7, 4, 8, 5, 3, 1>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <5, 1, 7, 4, 6, 5> with chord (1, 4)
2. <5, 3, 0, 9, 7, 1, 5> with chord (0, 9)
3. <5, 8, 9, 7, 4, 6, 1, 5> with chord (8, 6)
4. <6, 1, 7, 4, 8, 6> with chord (1, 4)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<5, 1, 7, 4, 6, 5>
<5, 3, 0, 9, 7, 1, 5>
<6, 1, 7, 4, 8, 6>
