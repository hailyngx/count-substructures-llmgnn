Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 14) (1, 12) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 5) (8, 12) (8, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (13, 10) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 14) (6, 8) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 1) (7, 11) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 4) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 8) (10, 13) (10, 9) (11, 13) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 9) (14, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 2) (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (9, 0) (9, 10) (9, 11)

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle <0, 3, 1, 2, 4, 0>
- Cycle <5, 8, 13, 3, 1, 2, 5>
- Cycle <6, 8, 13, 3, 1, 14, 6>
- Cycle <7, 1, 14, 6, 11, 7>
- Cycle <9, 0, 3, 1, 14, 9>
- Cycle <10, 13, 3, 1, 14, 10>
- Cycle <11, 13, 3, 1, 14, 11>
  
Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <11, 13, 3, 1, 14, 11>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [6].
