Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (0, 1, 9, 4, 0)
- (0, 1, 14, 3, 0)
- (0, 6, 7, 4, 0)
- (1, 10, 1)
- (1, 10, 14, 3, 1)
- (1, 8, 13, 2, 1)
- (1, 8, 14, 7, 6, 0, 1)
- (2, 7, 4, 9, 3, 14, 2)
- (2, 7, 14, 1, 10, 14, 2)
- (2, 7, 14, 8, 13, 2)
- (3, 9, 4, 7, 14, 3)
- (3, 9, 1, 10, 14, 3)
- (3, 9, 1, 8, 13, 2, 11, 12, 5, 13, 3)
- (4, 7, 6, 8, 14, 3, 4)
- (5, 13, 2, 7, 4, 0, 5)
- (5, 13, 2, 11, 12, 0, 5)
- (6, 7, 14, 1, 10, 1, 6)
- (7, 4, 9, 3, 14, 2, 7)
- (8, 14, 3, 9, 4, 7, 8)
- (8, 14, 7, 4, 0, 6, 8)
- (9, 4, 7, 14, 1, 10, 9)
- (12, 5, 13, 8, 14, 7, 6, 12)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (8, 13), 2, 1>
- <1, (6, 8), 14, 1>
- <2, (7, 14), 1, 2>
- <2, (13, 12), 5, 2>
- <3, (9, 1), 10, 14, 3>
- <3, (4, 7), 8, 14, 3>
- <4, (9, 7), 6, 8, 4>
- <5, (12, 0), 6, 7, 5>
- <13, (8, 12), 2, 11, 13>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [9]
