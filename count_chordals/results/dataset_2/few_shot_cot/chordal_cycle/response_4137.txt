Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 1, 14, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 7, 5, 4>
- Cycle 3: <1, 10, 4, 5, 2>
- Cycle 4: <1, 10, 11, 8, 7>
- Cycle 5: <1, 12, 6, 5, 14>
- Cycle 6: <1, 12, 11, 8, 7>
- Cycle 7: <2, 4, 7, 5, 6>
- Cycle 8: <2, 12, 6, 5, 4>
- Cycle 9: <3, 1, 10, 4, 11>
- Cycle 10: <3, 1, 14, 5, 4>
- Cycle 11: <3, 13, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle 12: <3, 13, 8, 11, 12>

Step 2: Checking for each cycle if it contains exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Chord present
- Cycle 2: Chord present
- Cycle 3: Chord present
- Cycle 4: Chord present
- Cycle 5: Chord present
- Cycle 6: Chord present
- Cycle 7: Chord present
- Cycle 8: Chord present
- Cycle 9: Chord present
- Cycle 10: Chord present
- Cycle 11: Chord present
- Cycle 12: Chord present

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are no chordless cycles found in the graph.

Result: There are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. Therefore, the final count is [0].
