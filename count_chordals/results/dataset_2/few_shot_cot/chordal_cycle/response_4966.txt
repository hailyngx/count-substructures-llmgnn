Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (9, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 0, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 1, 8, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 6, 8, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 5, 8, 4)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 8, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 7, 8, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 4, 5, 1)
- Cycle 7: (5, 6, 8, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 7, 8, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 4, 6, 5)
- Cycle 10: (6, 3, 0, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 1, 4, 6)
- Cycle 12: (6, 8, 5, 6)
- Cycle 13: (8, 0, 7, 8)
- Cycle 14: (8, 1, 4, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 12 has 1 chord: (5, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, 5, 6, 8>
<1, 6, 8, 4>
<1, 4, 5, 1>
<5, 6, 8, 5>
