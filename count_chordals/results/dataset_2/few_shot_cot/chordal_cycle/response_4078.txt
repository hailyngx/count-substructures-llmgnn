Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0)

Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: <0, 9, 8, 1, 0> (chordless cycle)
        - Cycle 2: <0, 9, 8, 3, 0> (chordless cycle)
        - Cycle 3: <0, 9, 7, 1, 0> (chordless cycle)
        - Cycle 4: <1, 2, 6, 3, 1> (chordless cycle)
        - Cycle 5: <1, 2, 8, 9, 1> (chordless cycle)
        - Cycle 6: <1, 2, 8, 3, 1> (chordless cycle)
        - Cycle 7: <1, 4, 3, 8, 1> (chordless cycle)
        - Cycle 8: <2, 6, 3, 8, 2> (chordless cycle)
        - Cycle 9: <3, 5, 7, 1, 3> (chordless cycle)
        - Cycle 10: <3, 7, 8, 2, 3> (chordless cycle)
        - Cycle 11: <4, 3, 8, 1, 4> (chordless cycle)
        - Cycle 12: <4, 0, 7, 1, 4> (chordless cycle)
        - Cycle 13: <5, 3, 6, 2, 5> (chordless cycle)
        - Cycle 14: <6, 9, 8, 2, 6> (chordless cycle)
        - Cycle 15: <7, 5, 3, 4, 7> (chordless cycle)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
        - Cycle 1: <0, 9, (1, 8), 0>
        - Cycle 2: <0, 9, (3, 8), 0>
        - Cycle 3: <0, 9, (1, 7), 0>
        - Cycle 4: <1, 2, (6, 3), 1>
        - Cycle 5: <1, 2, (8, 9), 1>
        - Cycle 6: <1, 2, (8, 3), 1>
        - Cycle 7: <1, 4, (3, 8), 1>
        - Cycle 8: <2, 6, (3, 8), 2>
        - Cycle 9: <3, 5, (7, 1), 3>
        - Cycle 10: <3, 7, (8, 2), 3>
        - Cycle 11: <4, 3, (8, 1), 4>
        - Cycle 12: <4, 0, (7, 1), 4>
        - Cycle 13: <5, 3, (6, 2), 5>
        - Cycle 14: <6, 9, (8, 2), 6>
        - Cycle 15: <7, 5, (3, 4), 7> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 15 chordless 4-cycles in the graph, so the final answer is [15].
