Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 9, 4, 7>
- <2, 1, 3, 5, 7>
- <3, 1, 2, 8, 6>
  
Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- <0, 5, 9, 4, 7> has a chord (5, 4)
- <2, 1, 3, 5, 7> has a chord (1, 7)
- <3, 1, 2, 8, 6> has a chord (1, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [3].
