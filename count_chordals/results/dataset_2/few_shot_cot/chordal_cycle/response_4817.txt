Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle with nodes: 0 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 0
- Cycle with nodes: 0 -> 9 -> 5 -> 13 -> 6 -> 0
- Cycle with nodes: 0 -> 9 -> 5 -> 13 -> 4 -> 7 -> 0
- Cycle with nodes: 0 -> 14 -> 6 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 14 -> 0
- Cycle with nodes: 0 -> 14 -> 3 -> 4 -> 9 -> 12 -> 14 -> 0
- Cycle with nodes: 1 -> 6 -> 9 -> 12 -> 6 -> 1
- Cycle with nodes: 3 -> 4 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 4 -> 3
- Cycle with nodes: 3 -> 14 -> 6 -> 9 -> 12 -> 14 -> 3
- Cycle with nodes: 4 -> 9 -> 5 -> 13 -> 6 -> 4
- Cycle with nodes: 5 -> 9 -> 6 -> 13 -> 5
- Cycle with nodes: 5 -> 13 -> 4 -> 9 -> 8 -> 5
- Cycle with nodes: 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 7 -> 4 -> 13 -> 6
- Cycle with nodes: 6 -> 10 -> 6
- Cycle with nodes: 7 -> 5 -> 9 -> 12 -> 4 -> 7
- Cycle with nodes: 8 -> 9 -> 4 -> 11 -> 3 -> 14 -> 1 -> 6 -> 8
- Cycle with nodes: 14 -> 6 -> 9 -> 5 -> 13 -> 4 -> 14

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
- <0, (9, 5), 7, 0>
- <0, (9, 5), 13, 6, 0>
- <0, (9, 5), 13, 4, 7, 0>
- <0, 14, (6, 1), 2, 3, 14, 0>
- <0, 14, 3, 4, (9, 12), 14, 0>
- <1, 6, 9, 12, 6, 1>
- <3, 4, 9, 5, 7, 4, 3>
- <3, 14, 6, 9, 12, 14, 3>
- <4, 9, 5, 13, 6, 4>
- <5, 9, 6, 13, 5>
- <5, 13, 4, 9, (8, 5)>
- <6, 9, 5, 7, 4, 13, 6>
- <6, (10, 6)>
- <7, 5, 9, 12, 4, 7>
- <8, 9, 4, 11, 3, 14, (1, 6), 8>
- <14, 6, 9, 5, 13, 4, 14>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are a total of [15] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
