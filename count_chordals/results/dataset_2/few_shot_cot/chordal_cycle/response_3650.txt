Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 5, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 3, 4>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 6, 3>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 2, 6>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 6, 9>
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 9, 6>
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 9: <2, 5, 1, 4>
- Cycle 10: <2, 6, 3, 1>
- Cycle 11: <2, 6, 7, 8>
- Cycle 12: <3, 6, 9, 8>
- Cycle 13: <3, 4, 1, 5>
- Cycle 14: <3, 4, 9, 6>
- Cycle 15: <4, 5, 2, 6>
- Cycle 16: <4, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 17: <4, 1, 5, 8>
- Cycle 18: <5, 8, 7, 6>

Step 2: Checking for a single chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 5, 4>, Chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 3, 4>, No chord
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 6, 3>, No chord
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 2, 6>, No chord
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 8, 9>, Chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 6, 9>, No chord
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 9, 6>, Chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 8, 9>, Chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 9: <2, 5, 1, 4>, No chord
- Cycle 10: <2, 6, 3, 1>, No chord
- Cycle 11: <2, 6, 7, 8>, Chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 12: <3, 6, 9, 8>, Chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 13: <3, 4, 1, 5>, Chord: (4, 5)
- Cycle 14: <3, 4, 9, 6>, Chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 15: <4, 5, 2, 6>, No chord
- Cycle 16: <4, 5, 8, 9>, No chord
- Cycle 17: <4, 1, 5, 8>, No chord
- Cycle 18: <5, 8, 7, 6>, No chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 1, 5, 4>, Chord: (1, 4)
- <1, 5, 8, 9>, Chord: (5, 9)
- <1, 4, 9, 6>, Chord: (1, 6)
- <2, 5, 8, 9>, Chord: (5, 9)
- <3, 4, 9, 6>, Chord: (4, 6)
