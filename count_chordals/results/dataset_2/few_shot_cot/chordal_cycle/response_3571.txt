Response:
Step 1: 
- We can identify the following cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
    - Cycle: <0, 4, 9, 6, 1>
    - Cycle: <0, 4, 3, 12, 1>
    - Cycle: <0, 3, 7, 11, 1>
    - Cycle: <1, 6, 9, 4, 0>
    - Cycle: <1, 6, 2, 3, 12>
    - Cycle: <1, 12, 8, 13, 9>
    - Cycle: <1, 11, 13, 9, 10>
    - Cycle: <1, 14, 13, 9, 6>
    - Cycle: <3, 2, 6, 9, 4>
    - Cycle: <3, 7, 11, 14, 13>
    - Cycle: <4, 0, 3, 2, 6>
    - Cycle: <4, 6, 1, 11, 7>
    - Cycle: <5, 2, 6, 9, 10>
    - Cycle: <5, 7, 11, 13, 14>
    - Cycle: <7, 3, 4, 9, 10>
- Let's now check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Step 2:
- Unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
    - Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 4, 3, 12> (Chord: (0, 12))
    - Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 3, 7, 11> (Chord: (0, 11))
    - Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 6, 9, 4> (Chord: (1, 9))
    - Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 6, 2, 3> (Chord: (1, 3))
    - Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 12, 8, 13> (Chord: (1, 8))
    - Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 14, 13, 9> (Chord: (1, 9))
    - Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 2, 6, 9> (Chord: (3, 9))
    - Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 7, 11, 14> (Chord: (3, 14))
    - Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 0, 3, 2> (Chord: (4, 2))
    - Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 6, 1, 11> (Chord: (4, 11))
    - Chordal 4-cycle: <7, 3, 4, 9> (Chord: (7, 9))

Step 3:
- Count of unique chordal 4-cycles: [11]
