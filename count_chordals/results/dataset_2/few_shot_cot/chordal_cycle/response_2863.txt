Response:
Step 1: List of cycles with 4 or more nodes:
- Cycle 0: 0 - 14 - 1 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 1: 0 - 14 - 1 - 2 - 12 - 4 - 6 - 4 - 12 - 2 - 1 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 3 - 8 - 7 - 13 - 17 - 16 - 8 - 19 - 10 - 15 - 11 - 5 - 18 - 0
- Cycle 3: 1 - 14 - 0 - 18 - 9 - 10 - 15 - 11 - 17 - 13 - 7 - 8 - 3 - 18 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 3 - 8 - 16 - 17 - 13 - 7 - 10 - 9 - 18 - 0 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 5: 10 - 15 - 11 - 17 - 13 - 7 - 8 - 19 - 4 - 12 - 2 - 1 - 14 - 0 - 3 - 10

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 0 has a chord (1, 3).
- Cycle 1 has chords (1, 12) and (2, 4).
- Cycle 2 has a chord (3, 8).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (0, 9).
- Cycle 4 has a chord (8, 16).
- Cycle 5 has chords (10, 17) and (12, 4).

Step 3: Counting chordless cycles: 
Out of the cycles listed above, the chordless cycles are Cycle 2 and Cycle 4. Thus, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 3, 8, 16>
- <1, 3, 8, 7>
