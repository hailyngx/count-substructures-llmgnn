Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all edges existing:
- Cycle: <3, 15, 19, 0, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 15, 19, 11, 1, 14, 4, 7, 9, 12, 5, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 15, 17, 8, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 16, 17, 8, 3>
- Cycle: <15, 19, 11, 18, 3, 15>
- Cycle: <4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14, 4>
- Cycle: <5, 12, 9, 7, 4, 14, 1, 11, 18, 13, 12, 5>
- Cycle: <5, 12, 13, 14, 1, 11, 18, 3, 5>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle: <3, 15, 19, 0, 3> (Chord: (19, 15))
- Cycle: <3, 15, 17, 8, 3> (Chord: (15, 8))
- Cycle: <3, 16, 17, 8, 3> (Chord: (16, 17))
- Cycle: <15, 19, 11, 18, 3, 15> (Chord: (11, 18))
- Cycle: <5, 12, 13, 14, 1, 11, 18, 3, 5> (Chord: (14, 11))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [3]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- Chordal cycle: <3, 15, 17, 8, 3> 
- Chordal cycle: <3, 16, 17, 8, 3> 
- Chordal cycle: <15, 19, 11, 18, 3, 15>
