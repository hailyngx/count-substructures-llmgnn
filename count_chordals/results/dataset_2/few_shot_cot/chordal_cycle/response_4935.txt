Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
  
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 8, 5>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 9, 5>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 6: <0, 6, 2, 5>
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 2, 6>
- Cycle 8: <1, 4, 7, 0>
- Cycle 9: <1, 4, 2, 5>
- Cycle 10: <1, 3, 7, 8>
- Cycle 11: <2, 4, 7, 8>
- Cycle 12: <2, 4, 1, 6>
- Cycle 13: <2, 4, 7, 0>
- Cycle 14: <2, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 15: <3, 7, 0, 6>
- Cycle 16: <3, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 17: <3, 7, 8, 5>
- Cycle 18: <3, 1, 4, 2>
- Cycle 19: <4, 7, 3, 5>
- Cycle 20: <4, 7, 8, 5>
- Cycle 21: <4, 2, 5, 8>
- Cycle 22: <5, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle 23: <5, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle 24: <5, 9, 8, 7>
- Cycle 25: <5, 2, 1, 6>
- Cycle 26: <6, 9, 5, 8>
- Cycle 27: <6, 9, 3, 7>
- Cycle 28: <6, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 29: <6, 1, 4, 7>
- Cycle 30: <7, 4, 2, 1>
- Cycle 31: <7, 8, 3, 5>
- Cycle 32: <7, 8, 5, 9>
- Cycle 33: <8, 5, 2, 4>
- Cycle 34: <8, 5, 9, 6>
- Cycle 35: <8, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 36: <9, 5, 2, 4>
- Cycle 37: <9, 5, 8, 7>
- Cycle 38: <9, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 39: <9, 3, 1, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
  
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 7, 4, 1, (1, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, 4, 7, 8, (4, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 9, 8, 7, (8, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, 7, 3, 5, (7, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, 6, 1, 4, (1, 4)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
  
- There are 35 chordless cycles.

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get [35].
