The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-4-9-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-8-1-7-5-2-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-8-2-4-7-1-5-0
- Cycle 4: 1-7-4-9-3-8-2-5-1
- Cycle 5: 1-7-4-2-8-3-0-6-9-1
- Cycle 6: 2-4-7-1-5-2
- Cycle 7: 2-4-7-5-1-8-3-0-6-2
- Cycle 8: 3-4-7-2-8-5-1-7

Step 2:
Identifying chordal cycles:
- Cycle 1 has 2 non-adjacent chords: (3, 9)
- Cycle 2 has 1 non-adjacent chord: (1, 2)
- Cycle 3 has 1 non-adjacent chord: (3, 7)
- Cycle 4 has 1 non-adjacent chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 5 has 1 non-adjacent chord: (2, 6)
- Cycle 6 has no non-adjacent chords
- Cycle 7 has 2 non-adjacent chords: (4, 6), (7, 1)
- Cycle 8 has 1 non-adjacent chord: (4, 2)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 3, 4, 9, 0> with non-adjacent chord (3, 9)
- <0, 3, 8, 1, 7, 5, 2, 0> with non-adjacent chord (1, 2)
- <0, 3, 8, 2, 4, 7, 1, 5, 0> with non-adjacent chord (3, 7)
- <1, 7, 4, 9, 3, 8, 2, 5, 1> with non-adjacent chord (4, 8)
- <1, 7, 4, 2, 8, 3, 0, 6, 9, 1> with non-adjacent chord (2, 6)
- <2, 4, 7, 1, 5, 2> with no non-adjacent chords
