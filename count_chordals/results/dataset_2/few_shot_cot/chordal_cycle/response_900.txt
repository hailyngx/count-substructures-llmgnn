Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <3, 1, 6, 4, 12, 10, 11, 3>
- Cycle 2: <3, 1, 6, 14, 12, 10, 11, 3>
- Cycle 3: <3, 1, 13, 11, 0, 9, 5, 3>
- Cycle 4: <3, 5, 7, 14, 4, 6, 1, 3>
- Cycle 5: <4, 14, 7, 5, 3, 11, 6, 4>
- Cycle 6: <5, 9, 6, 1, 13, 11, 3, 5>
- Cycle 7: <5, 13, 11, 0, 2, 4, 12, 9, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, 1, 6, 4, 12, 10, 11, 3> -> Chord: (4, 10)
- <3, 1, 6, 14, 12, 10, 11, 3> -> Chord: (14, 10)
- <3, 1, 13, 11, 0, 9, 5, 3> -> Chord: (13, 5)
- <3, 5, 7, 14, 4, 6, 1, 3> -> Chord: (7, 14)
- <4, 14, 7, 5, 3, 11, 6, 4> -> Chord: (7, 11)
- <5, 9, 6, 1, 13, 11, 3, 5> -> Chord: (9, 1)
- <5, 13, 11, 0, 2, 4, 12, 9, 5> -> Chord: (13, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<3, 1, 6, 4, 12, 10, 11, 3>
<3, 1, 6, 14, 12, 10, 11, 3>
<3, 1, 13, 11, 0, 9, 5, 3>
<3, 5, 7, 14, 4, 6, 1, 3>
<4, 14, 7, 5, 3, 11, 6, 4>
<5, 9, 6, 1, 13, 11, 3, 5>
<5, 13, 11, 0, 2, 4, 12, 9, 5>
