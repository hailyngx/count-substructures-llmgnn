Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <15, 13, 5, 6>
- <15, 13, 7, 3>
- <15, 20, 9, 8>
- <15, 20, 24, 27>
- <20, 9, 10, 21>
- <5, 13, 7, 3>
- <5, 13, 15, 20>
- <5, 18, 11, 14>
- <6, 5, 13, 15>
- <6, 5, 18, 11>
- <6, 0, 16, 26>

- <24, 20, 15, 13>
- <24, 27, 22, 16>
- <18, 5, 13, 15>
- <18, 5, 13, 15>

Step 2:
The chords in each of these cycles are:
- Chord in <15, 13, 5, 6> is (15, 6)
- Chord in <5, 13, 7, 3> is (13, 3)
- Chord in <5, 13, 15, 20> is (5, 20)
- Chord in <6, 5, 18, 11> is (5, 18)
- Chord in <17, 24, 27, 22> is (24, 27)
- Chord in <29, 17, 24, 20> is (17, 24)
- Chord in <13, 7, 3, 10> is (7, 10)
- Chord in <21, 10, 25, 12> is (10, 25)
- Chord in <8, 9, 10, 21> is (9, 10)

Step 3:
The chordless cycles are:
- <15, 20, 9, 8>
- <15, 20, 24, 27>
- <20, 9, 10, 21>
- <5, 18, 11, 14>
- <6, 0, 16, 26>
- <29, 3, 7, 13>
- <26, 28, 17, 24>
- <13, 5, 18, 11>
- <13, 7, 1, 11>
- <3, 7, 1, 11>
- <3, 7, 13, 15>
- <28, 17, 24, 27>
- <40> 
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [13].
