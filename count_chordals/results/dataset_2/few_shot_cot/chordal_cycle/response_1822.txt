Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <6, 9, 8, 5, 2, 6>
- Cycle 2: <6, 9, 8, 5, 7, 6>
- Cycle 3: <6, 9, 8, 1, 5, 6>
- Cycle 4: <6, 9, 8, 1, 3, 6>
- Cycle 5: <6, 9, 2, 5, 7, 6>
- Cycle 6: <6, 9, 2, 5, 1, 6>
- Cycle 7: <6, 9, 2, 8, 1, 6>
- Cycle 8: <6, 9, 3, 1, 5, 6>
- Cycle 9: <6, 9, 3, 7, 4, 6>
- Cycle 10: <6, 9, 3, 7, 5, 6>
- Cycle 11: <6, 9, 3, 7, 5, 1, 6>
- Cycle 12: <6, 7, 4, 1, 5, 6>
- Cycle 13: <6, 7, 5, 1, 3, 6>
- Cycle 14: <6, 7, 5, 1, 8, 6>
- Cycle 15: <6, 7, 3, 1, 5, 6>
- Cycle 16: <6, 7, 3, 9, 2, 5, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycles 1-9 are chordal cycles.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are [9] chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<6, 9, 8, 5, 2>
<6, 9, 8, 5, 7>
<6, 9, 8, 1, 5>
<6, 9, 8, 1, 3>
<6, 9, 2, 5, 7>
<6, 9, 3, 1, 5>
<6, 7, 4, 1, 5>
<6, 7, 5, 1, 3>
<6, 7, 3, 1, 9>
