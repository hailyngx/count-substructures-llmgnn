4. Cycle <0, 1, 6, 4>
5. Cycle <0, 1, 6, 2>
6. Cycle <0, 1, 5, 9>
7. Cycle <1, 6, 4, 9>
8. Cycle <1, 6, 2, 5>
9. Cycle <1, 6, 2, 8>
10. Cycle <1, 6, 2, 3>
11. Cycle <1, 8, 5, 9>
12. Cycle <1, 8, 3, 9>

31. Cycle <7, 8, 5, 1>
32. Cycle <7, 8, 5, 9>
33. Cycle <7, 8, 3, 9>
34. Cycle <8, 5, 1, 0>
35. Cycle <8, 5, 9, 7>
36. Cycle <8, 5, 9, 3>
37. Cycle <8, 3, 4, 6>
38. Cycle <8, 3, 4, 9>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 7, 9, 5> (Chord: (7, 5))
2. <0, 7, 8, 5> (Chord: (7, 8))
3. <1, 6, 4, 9> (Chord: (6, 9))
4. <1, 6, 2, 5> (Chord: (6, 5))
5. <1, 8, 5, 9> (Chord: (8, 9))

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
