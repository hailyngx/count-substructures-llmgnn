Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 11, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 14, 8>
- Cycle 3: <0, 17, 10, 8>
- Cycle 4: <0, 17, 5, 11>
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 12, 4>
- Cycle 6: <3, 11, 5, 17>
- Cycle 7: <3, 14, 8, 2>
- Cycle 8: <4, 12, 7, 16>
- Cycle 9: <4, 12, 1, 0>
- Cycle 10: <5, 11, 0, 17>
- Cycle 11: <5, 17, 10, 6>
- Cycle 12: <6, 10, 8, 2>
- Cycle 13: <6, 11, 5, 17>
- Cycle 14: <7, 12, 1, 0>
- Cycle 15: <9, 11, 5, 17>
- Cycle 16: <9, 15, 13, 18>
- Cycle 17: <9, 15, 13, 19>
- Cycle 18: <10, 17, 5, 11>
- Cycle 19: <10, 17, 0, 3>
- Cycle 20: <12, 4, 19, 13>
- Cycle 21: <14, 3, 11, 5>

- Cycle 23: <14, 8, 2, 15>
- Cycle 24: <19, 4, 12, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 3, 11, 5> (Chord: (3, 14))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- Number of chordless cycles: [23]
