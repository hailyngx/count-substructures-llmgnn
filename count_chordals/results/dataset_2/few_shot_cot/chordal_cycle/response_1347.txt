Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 5, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph, including:
1. <0, 1, 4, 5>
2. <3, 1, 4, 5>
3. <7, 3, 1, 4>
4. <8, 9, 2, 1>
5. <0, 1, 3, 7>
6. <1, 3, 7, 8>
7. <1, 3, 9, 8>
8. <0, 1, 5, 6>
9. <0, 4, 5, 6>
10. <7, 3, 5, 6>
11. <2, 7, 8, 9>
12. <0, 6, 5, 1>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the cycle <0, 1, 4, 5> has exactly one chord which is the edge (1, 4).

Step 3:
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the count inside brackets is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 1, 4, 5> with chord (1, 4)
