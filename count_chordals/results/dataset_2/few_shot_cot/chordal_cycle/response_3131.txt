Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the given graph. However, only some of them form chordal 4-cycles. Let's list them below:
1. <5, 9, 4, 6>
2. <5, 9, 4, 2>
3. <5, 9, 2, 7>
4. <5, 6, 7, 8>
5. <4, 9, 2, 6>
6. <4, 6, 7, 2>
7. <4, 6, 3, 4>
8. <8, 5, 0, 7>
9. <1, 9, 2, 7>
10. <1, 7, 0, 8>

Step 2:
Now, let's identify the unique chordal 4-cycles from the above list:
1. <5, 9, 4, 6> (Chord: (4, 9))
2. <5, 9, 4, 2> (Chord: (4, 9))

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is counted as the number of unique chordal 4-cycles, which is 2.
Thus, the final count is [2].
