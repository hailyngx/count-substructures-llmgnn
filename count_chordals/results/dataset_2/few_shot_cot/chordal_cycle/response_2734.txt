Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 2, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 1, 0, 6, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 1, 4, 8, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 7, 0, 6, 9)
- Cycle 7: (6, 2, 1, 4, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 0, 1, 9, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 0, 5, 3, 6)
- Cycle 10: (1, 9, 8, 4, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 2, 6, 7, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 2, 4, 8, 1)
- Cycle 13: (3, 5, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 14: (4, 1, 0, 6, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 1, 2, 7, 4)
- Cycle 16: (4, 8, 9, 5, 4)
- Cycle 17: (8, 9, 7, 2, 8)
- Cycle 18: (0, 5, 9, 6, 0)
- Cycle 19: (0, 5, 7, 2, 0)
- Cycle 20: (0, 1, 2, 7, 0)
- Cycle 21: (0, 1, 4, 8, 0)
- Cycle 22: (0, 3, 5, 7, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (1, 0), 9, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (7, 9), 6, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (7, 2), 6, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (1, 0), 6, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, (1, 4), 8, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, (7, 0), 6, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6, (2, 1), 4, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, (0, 1), 9, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <6, (5, 3), 0, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <1, (9, 8), 4, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <1, (2, 7), 4, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <1, (2, 4), 8, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <3, (5, 9), 7, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <4, (1, 0), 6, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <4, (2, 7), 1, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <4, (8, 9), 5, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <8, (9, 7), 2, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <0, (5, 9), 6, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <0, (5, 7), 2, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 20: <0, (1, 2), 7, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 21: <0, (1, 4), 8, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 22: <0, (3, 5), 7, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 23 chordless 4-cycles in total, so the final count is [23].
