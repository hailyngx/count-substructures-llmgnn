Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 5, 3>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 1, 7>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 6: <0, 2, 9, 4>
- Cycle 7: <3, 5, 1, 7>
- Cycle 8: <3, 1, 5, 7>
- Cycle 9: <3, 1, 7, 4>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: Edge (1, 5)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: Edge (0, 1)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: Edge (4, 1)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: Edge (0, 1)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: Edge (0, 1)
- Cycle 6 does not have exactly one chord
- Cycle 7 has one chord: Edge (1, 7)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: Edge (1, 7)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: Edge (1, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles = [6]

Unique Chordal 4-Cycles:
- <0, 4, 1, 5>
- <0, 1, 5, 3>
- <0, 4, 1, 7>
- <0, 6, 1, 5>
- <3, 5, 1, 7>
- <3, 1, 7, 4>
