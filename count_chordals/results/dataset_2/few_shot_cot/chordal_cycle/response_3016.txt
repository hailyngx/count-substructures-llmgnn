Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: <1, 11, 15, 0, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 14, 19, 16, 2, 4, 16, 7, 3, 9, 18, 6, 15, 11, 12, 13, 17, 13, 10, 2, 1>
- Cycle 3: <3, 9, 18, 6, 15, 11, 12, 13, 17, 13, 10, 19, 14, 1, 11, 8, 5, ... continuing back to 3>
- Cycle 4: <4, 2, 16, 19, 0, 15, 11, 12, 13, 17, 13, 10, 2>
- Cycle 5: <8, 5, 18, 6, 15, 11, 12, 13, 17, 13, 10, 2, 16, 7, 3, 9, ... continuing back to 8>
- Cycle 6: <13, 17, 13, 10, 19, 14, 1, 11, 8, 5, 18, 6>
- Cycle 7: <16, 7, 3, 9, 18, 6, 15, 11, 12, 13, 17, 13, 10, 2>
- Cycle 8: <18, 6, 15, 11, 12, 13, 17, 13, 10, 2, 16, 7, 3, 9, 0, 19, 14, 1>
- Cycle 9: <19, 14, 1, 11, 8, 5, 18, 6, 15, 0, 9, 3, 7, 16, 2, 4>
- Other cycles exist but they are either longer or sub-cycles of the above cycles.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, 14, 19, 16, 2, 4, 16, 7, 3, 9, 18, 6, 15, 11, 12, 13, 17, 13, 10, 2, 1> has one chord <1, 10>.
- <1, 11, 15, 0, 1> has one chord <1, 15>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are no chordless 4-cycles in this graph.

Putting it all together, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
