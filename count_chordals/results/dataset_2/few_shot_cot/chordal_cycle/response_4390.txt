Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 8, 11, 3>
- <0, 10, 12, 13>
- <1, 5, 9, 6>
- <1, 6, 4, 8>
- <2, 13, 12, 10>
- <2, 13, 7, 14>
- <3, 6, 4, 8>
- <4, 5, 9, 6>
- <5, 9, 14, 7>
- <6, 1, 2, 13>
- <7, 13, 12, 10>
- <8, 5, 4, 10>
- <9, 5, 4, 10>
- <10, 9, 5, 1>
- <11, 8, 4, 6>

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle.
- <0, 8, 11, 3> has chord (0, 3).
- <0, 10, 12, 13> has chord (10, 13).
- <1, 5, 9, 6> has chord (1, 9).
- <1, 6, 4, 8> has chord (1, 8).
- <2, 13, 12, 10> has chord (2, 12).
- <2, 13, 7, 14> has chord (2, 7).
- <3, 6, 4, 8> has no chord.
- <4, 5, 9, 6> has chord (4, 9).
- <5, 9, 14, 7> has chord (5, 14).
- <6, 1, 2, 13> has chord (1, 13).
- <7, 13, 12, 10> has chord (7, 12).
- <8, 5, 4, 10> has chord (5, 10).
- <9, 5, 4, 10> has chord (5, 4).
- <10, 9, 5, 1> has chord (9, 5).
- <11, 8, 4, 6> has chord (8, 4).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <3, 6, 4, 8>.
