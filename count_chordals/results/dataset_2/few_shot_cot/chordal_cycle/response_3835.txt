Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 2, 7) with edges (2, 7), (2, 5), and (5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 3, 0) with edges (5, 3), (3, 0), and (0, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 5, 19, 11) with edges (5, 19), (19, 11), and (11, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 5, 19, 14) with edges (5, 19), (19, 14), and (14, 2)
- Cycle 5: (7, 2, 5, 1) with edges (2, 7), (2, 5), and (5, 1)
- Cycle 6: (10, 4, 7, 15) with edges (4, 7), (7, 15), and (15, 10)
- Cycle 7: (10, 4, 12, 6) with edges (4, 12), (12, 6), and (6, 10)
- Cycle 8: (10, 4, 7, 2) with edges (4, 7), (7, 2), and (2, 10)
- Cycle 9: (11, 15, 7, 2) with edges (15, 7), (7, 2), and (2, 11)

Step 2: Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (0, 5)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (5, 11)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (2, 19)
- Cycle 5 does not have a chord
- Cycle 6 does not have a chord
- Cycle 7 does not have a chord
- Cycle 8 does not have a chord
- Cycle 9 does not have a chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 5, 2, 7> with chord (1, 7)
- <1, 5, 3, 0> with chord (0, 5)
- <2, 5, 19, 14> with chord (2, 19)
- <2, 5, 19, 11> with chord (5, 11)
