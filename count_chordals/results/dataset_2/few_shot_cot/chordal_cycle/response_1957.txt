Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges are:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-12-2-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-2-12-3-0
- Cycle 3: 1-3-12-2-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-4-6-16-13-10-14-11-4-1
- Cycle 5: 1-4-11-7-15-17-19-8-9-18-4-1
- Cycle 6: 1-4-18-7-15-2-12-3-1
- Cycle 7: 1-19-8-9-18-7-11-4-1
- Cycle 8: 1-19-17-15-2-12-3-0-7-11-4-1
- Cycle 9: 3-1-4-18-9-8-19-17-15-7-0-3
- Cycle 10: 4-1-19-17-15-7-0-3-12-10-14-11-4

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: <1, (4, 18), 7>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [9].
