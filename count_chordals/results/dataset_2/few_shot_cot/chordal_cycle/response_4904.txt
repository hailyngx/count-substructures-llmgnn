Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Possible cycles:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 8, 1) (chord: 8)
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 15, 1) (chord: 15)
- Cycle 3: (0, 17, 10, 3) (chord: 10)
- Cycle 4: (0, 17, 2, 15, 1) (chord: 15)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 1, 8, 1> with chord 8
- <0, 1, 15, 1> with chord 15
- <0, 17, 10, 3> with chord 10

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [0] chordless cycles in the graph.
