Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph, but none of them are chordal 4-cycles since they do not contain a chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Step 2:
There are no chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Step 3:
Therefore, the count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
