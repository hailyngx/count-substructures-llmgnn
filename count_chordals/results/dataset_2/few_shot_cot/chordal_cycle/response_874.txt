Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 3, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 5, 4, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 6, 7, 8, 2>
- Cycle 4: <3, 5, 6, 9, 3>
- Cycle 5: <5, 6, 7, 8, 5>
- Cycle 6: <6, 7, 8, 2, 6>
- Cycle 7: <7, 6, 5, 8, 7>

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find that the following cycles have exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 5, 4, 1> with chord (3, 5)
- <5, 6, 7, 8, 5> with chord (6, 8)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we see that there are 5 chordless cycles. 
Therefore, the final count is [5].
