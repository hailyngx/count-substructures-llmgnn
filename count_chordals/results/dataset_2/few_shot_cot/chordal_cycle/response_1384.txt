Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 4, 7, 2, 8, 0> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 4, 7, 3, 6, 9, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has a chord (2,8) 
- Cycle 2 has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 9, 4, 7, 2, 8, 0>.
