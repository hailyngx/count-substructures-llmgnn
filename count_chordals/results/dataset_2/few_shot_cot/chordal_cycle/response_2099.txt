Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (2, 11, 27, 19)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 5, 21)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (19, 27)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (15, 21)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
