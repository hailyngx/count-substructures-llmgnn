Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
- Possible 4-cycles: 
<0, 6, 3, 4>
<0, 6, 7, 5>
<0, 4, 1, 7>
<0, 4, 2, 8>
<1, 4, 2, 9>
<1, 4, 3, 8>
<2, 4, 9, 5>
<2, 4, 8, 3>
<3, 4, 0, 6>
<3, 4, 1, 7>
<5, 8, 2, 9>
<5, 8, 3, 7>
<6, 7, 1, 4>
<6, 7, 3, 9>
<7, 5, 8, 2>
<7, 5, 9, 6>

Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
<0, (3, 4), 6>
<0, (4, 7), 1>
<2, (4, 9), 5>
<2, (8, 3), 4>
<3, (4, 6), 9>
<7, (5, 8), 2>

Step 3:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles found = [6]
