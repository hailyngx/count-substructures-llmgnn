Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
<0, 5, 1, 3> (chord: 1-5)
<0, 5, 9, 3> (chord: 3-9)
<0, 4, 7, 8> (chord: 4-7)
<1, 5, 9, 3> (chord: 1-9)
<3, 5, 9, 7> (chord: 7-9)

Step 2:
Out of the above cycles, only one of them has exactly one chord:
<0, 5, 1, 3> (chord: 1-5)

Step 3: 
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
