Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 9, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are: 
1. <0, 4, 1, 9, 0> with chord (4, 1)
2. <0, 4, 6, 9, 0> with chord (4, 6)
3. <0, 4, 7, 9, 0> with chord (4, 7)
4. <1, 4, 6, 9, 1> with chord (4, 6)
5. <1, 4, 7, 9, 1> with chord (4, 7)
6. <2, 5, 0, 3, 2> with chord (5, 0)
7. <2, 5, 3, 8, 2> with chord (5, 3)
8. <3, 4, 7, 9, 3> with chord (4, 7)
9. <4, 7, 9, 6, 4> with chord (7, 6)
10. <6, 4, 7, 9, 6> with chord (4, 7)
11. <6, 9, 8, 1, 6> with chord (9, 8)
12. <8, 3, 0, 5, 8> with chord (3, 5)
13. <8, 3, 4, 7, 8> with chord (3, 4)
14. <9, 7, 4, 1, 9> with chord (7, 1)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are: 
1. <0, 4, 1, 9, 0> with chord (4, 1)
2. <0, 4, 6, 9, 0> with chord (4, 6)
3. <0, 4, 7, 9, 0> with chord (4, 7)
4. <1, 4, 6, 9, 1> with chord (4, 6)
5. <1, 4, 7, 9, 1> with chord (4, 7)
6. <2, 5, 0, 3, 2> with chord (5, 0)
7. <2, 5, 3, 8, 2> with chord (5, 3)
8. <3, 4, 7, 9, 3> with chord (4, 7)
9. <4, 7, 9, 6, 4> with chord (7, 6)
10. <8, 3, 0, 5, 8> with chord (3, 5)
11. <8, 3, 4, 7, 8> with chord (3, 4)
12. <9, 7, 4, 1, 9> with chord (7, 1)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we find that there are 12 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [12].
