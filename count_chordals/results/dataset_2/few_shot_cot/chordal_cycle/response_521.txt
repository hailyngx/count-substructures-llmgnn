Response:
Step 1: 

- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:

- There are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Step 3:

- Since there are no chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, the count of chordless cycles is 0.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
