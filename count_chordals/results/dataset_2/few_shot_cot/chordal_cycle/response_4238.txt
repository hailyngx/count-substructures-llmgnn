Response:
Let's first list all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 4, 12, 14>
- Cycle 2: <3, 4, 12, 14, 1>
- Cycle 3: <4, 14, 1, 3, 11>
- Cycle 4: <14, 12, 4, 3, 1>
- Cycle 5: <12, 4, 3, 1, 16>
- Cycle 6: <16, 1, 3, 4, 12>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 11, 18, 13>
- Cycle 8: <3, 11, 18, 13, 5>
- Cycle 9: <11, 18, 13, 5, 17>
- Cycle 10: <18, 13, 5, 17, 6>
- Cycle 11: <13, 5, 17, 6, 10>
- Cycle 12: <5, 17, 6, 10, 7>
- Cycle 13: <17, 6, 10, 7, 15>
- Cycle 14: <6, 10, 7, 15, 16>
- Cycle 15: <10, 7, 15, 16, 0>
- Cycle 16: <7, 15, 16, 0, 3>
- Cycle 17: <15, 16, 0, 3, 1>
- Cycle 18: <16, 0, 3, 1, 14>
- Cycle 19: <18, 11, 5, 13, 18>
- Cycle 20: <8, 19, 1, 14, 12>
- Cycle 21: <19, 8, 16, 1, 14>
- Cycle 22: <9, 3, 1, 14, 12>
- Cycle 23: <0, 3, 1, 14, 12>

Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycles:
    - <1, 3, 4, 12> (Chord: (3, 14))
    - <3, 4, 12, 14> (Chord: (4, 1))
    - <4, 12, 14, 1> (Chord: (12, 3))
    - <14, 12, 4, 3> (Chord: (12, 1))
    - <12, 4, 3, 1> (Chord: (4, 14))
    - <16, 1, 3, 4> (Chord: (1, 14))
    - <1, 3, 11, 18> (Chord: (3, 18))
    - <3, 11, 18, 13> (Chord: (11, 5))
    - <11, 18, 13, 5> (Chord: (18, 17))
    - <18, 13, 5, 17> (Chord: (13, 6))
    - <13, 5, 17, 6> (Chord: (5, 10))
    - <5, 17, 6, 10> (Chord: (17, 7))
    - <17, 6, 10, 7> (Chord: (6, 15))
    - <6, 10, 7, 15> (Chord: (10, 16))
    - <10, 7, 15, 16> (Chord: (7, 0))
    - <7, 15, 16, 0> (Chord: (15, 3))
    - <15, 16, 0, 3> (Chord: (16, 1))
    - <16, 0, 3, 1> (Chord: (0, 14))
    - <18, 11, 5, 13> (Chord: (11, 18))
    - <8, 19, 1, 14> (Chord: (19, 8))
    - <19, 8, 16, 1> (Chord: (8, 16))
    - <9, 3, 1, 14> (Chord: (3, 12))
    - <0, 3, 1, 14> (Chord: (3, 16))

Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we get [23].
