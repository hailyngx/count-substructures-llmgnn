Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 2, 4, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 1, 4, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 4, 8, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 6, 7, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 6, 3, 0, 5>
- Cycle 6: <9, 6, 7, 1, 9>
- Cycle 7: <9, 6, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 8: <9, 5, 3, 6, 9>
- Cycle 9: <6, 5, 4, 9, 6>
- Cycle 10: <6, 7, 0, 3, 6>
- Cycle 11: <7, 6, 5, 9, 7>
- Cycle 12: <7, 6, 3, 0, 7>
- Cycle 13: <1, 9, 5, 3, 1>
- Cycle 14: <1, 9, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle 15: <1, 9, 6, 7, 1>
- Cycle 16: <1, 4, 9, 2, 1>
- Cycle 17: <1, 4, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 18: <1, 4, 8, 5, 1>
- Cycle 19: <1, 7, 6, 5, 1>
- Cycle 20: <1, 7, 0, 3, 1>
- Cycle 21: <1, 7, 6, 9, 1>
- Cycle 22: <1, 8, 4, 5, 1>
- Cycle 23: <1, 8, 5, 9, 1>
- Cycle 24: <1, 8, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle 25: <4, 5, 8, 1, 4>
- Cycle 26: <4, 5, 9, 2, 4>
- Cycle 27: <4, 5, 8, 9, 4>
- Cycle 28: <4, 9, 6, 5, 4>
- Cycle 29: <4, 9, 2, 5, 4>
  
Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has chord <9, 5>.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has chord <6, 7>.
- Cycle 7 has chord <6, 5>.
- Cycle 8 has chord <9, 5>.
- Cycle 9 has no chord.
- Cycle 10 has no chord.
- Cycle 11 has chord <6, 7>.
- Cycle 12 has no chord.
- Cycle 13 has no chord.
- Cycle 14 has no chord.
- Cycle 15 has no chord.
- Cycle 16 has no chord.
- Cycle 17 has no chord.
- Cycle 18 has chord <4, 8>.
- Cycle 19 has no chord.
- Cycle 20 has no chord.
- Cycle 21 has no chord.
- Cycle 22 has no chord.
- Cycle 23 has no chord.
- Cycle 24 has no chord.
- Cycle 25 has no chord.
- Cycle 26 has chord <9, 5>.
- Cycle 27 has no chord.
- Cycle 28 has no chord.
- Cycle 29 has no chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [7]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, 9, 4, 8, 5> (Chord: <9, 5>)
<9, 6, 7, 1, 9> (Chord: <6, 7>)
<9, 6, 5, 8, 9> (Chord: <6, 5>)
<9, 5, 3, 6, 9> (Chord: <9, 5>)
<1, 8, 4, 5, 1> (Chord: <4, 8>)
<4, 5, 9, 2, 4> (Chord: <9, 5>)
<6, 7, 0, 3, 6>
