- Cycle 26: <19, 6, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord <11, 18>
- Cycle 9 has exactly one chord <5, 18>
- Cycle 10 has exactly one chord <5, 19>
- Cycle 26 has exactly one chord <6, 15>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which have exactly one chord:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
