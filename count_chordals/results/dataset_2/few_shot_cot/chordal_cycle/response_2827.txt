Now let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (19, 14), 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (19, 3), 15)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <5, (9, 27), 12)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, (15, 14), 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, (15, 14), 20)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <11, (6, 25), 24)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <17, (3, 15), 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <29, (23, 3), 26)>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [82].
