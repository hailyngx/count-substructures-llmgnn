Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 6, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 4, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 2, 8, 0>

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5,6) 
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (1,4) 
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1,2) 

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordless 4-cycles in this graph.
