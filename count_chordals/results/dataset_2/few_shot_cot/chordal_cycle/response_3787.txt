Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 7, 0, 1) 
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 5, 2, 1) 
- Cycle 3: (1, 4, 5, 3, 1) 
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 6, 7, 4, 1) 
- Cycle 5: (2, 6, 7, 4, 5, 2) 
- Cycle 6: (3, 4, 5, 8, 3) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle). 
- Cycle 1 has a chord (0, 7). 
- Cycle 2 has a chord (5, 4). 
- Cycle 3 has a chord (5, 4). 
- Cycle 4 has no chord. 
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has a chord (5, 8). 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The chordless cycles are:
- Cycle 4: <1, 4, 7, 0>
- Cycle 5: <2, 6, 7, 4, 5>
The final count is [2].
