Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
1. <0, 4, 5, 12, 0>
2. <0, 4, 5, 3, 7, 14, 13, 8, 1, 10, 0>
3. <0, 4, 3, 7, 14, 13, 9, 2, 11, 0>
4. <1, 8, 13, 9, 2, 4, 0, 11, 12, 5, 1>
5. <2, 9, 13, 8, 12, 0, 4, 5, 12, 2>
6. <3, 9, 13, 8, 12, 5, 4, 0, 11, 2, 3>
7. <4, 5, 12, 8, 13, 9, 7, 3, 4>
8. <5, 12, 11, 0, 4, 3, 7, 1, 10, 5>
9. <7, 14, 13, 9, 2, 11, 0, 4, 3, 7>
10. <8, 13, 9, 7, 3, 12, 5, 4, 0, 10, 1>
11. <9, 13, 14, 7, 3, 4, 0, 11, 2, 9>
12. <12, 8, 1, 10, 0, 4, 3, 7, 14, 13, 12>
13. <13, 14, 7, 3, 4, 0, 11, 2, 9, 13>
14. <14, 7, 3, 12, 5, 4, 0, 10, 1, 8, 13>

Step 2:

The cycles with exactly one chord are: 
1. <0, 4, 5, 12, 0> (Chord: 5, 12)
2. <0, 4, 5, 3, 7, 14, 13, 8, 1, 10, 0> (Chord: 13, 8)
3. <1, 8, 13, 9, 2, 4, 0, 11, 12, 5, 1> (Chord: 13, 9)
4. <2, 9, 13, 8, 12, 0, 4, 5, 12, 2> (Chord: 13, 8)
5. <4, 5, 12, 8, 13, 9, 7, 3, 4> (Chord: 9, 7)
6. <7, 14, 13, 9, 2, 11, 0, 4, 3, 7> (Chord: 13, 9)
7. <8, 13, 9, 7, 3, 12, 5, 4, 0, 10, 1> (Chord: 9, 7)
8. <12, 8, 1, 10, 0, 4, 3, 7, 14, 13, 12> (Chord: 10, 0)

Step 3:

So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
