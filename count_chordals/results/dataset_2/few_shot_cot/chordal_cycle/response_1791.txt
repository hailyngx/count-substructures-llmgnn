Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 17, 11, 14, 5, 18>
- Cycle 2: <1, 8, 7, 5, 14, 13, 10, 3>
- Cycle 3: <2, 4, 7, 5, 14, 13, 1>
- Cycle 4: <3, 4, 7, 5, 14, 13, 10>
- Cycle 5: <4, 7, 5, 18, 9, 19>

Step 2: Checking for chords:
- The cycle <0, 6, 17, 11, 14, 5, 18> has a chord between nodes 11 and 5. Chord: (11, 5)
- The cycle <1, 8, 7, 5, 14, 13, 10, 3> has a chord between nodes 5 and 10. Chord: (5, 10)
- The cycle <2, 4, 7, 5, 14, 13, 1> has a chord between nodes 4 and 1. Chord: (4, 1)
- The cycle <3, 4, 7, 5, 14, 13, 10> has a chord between nodes 4 and 10. Chord: (4, 10)
- The cycle <4, 7, 5, 18, 9, 19> has a chord between nodes 7 and 9. Chord: (7, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
