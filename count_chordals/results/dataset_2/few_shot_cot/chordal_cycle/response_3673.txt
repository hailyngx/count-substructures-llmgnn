Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: Cycle 1 <1, 3, 5, 19>; Chord: (3, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: Cycle 3 <1, 3, 16, 11>; Chord: (3, 16)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: Cycle 4 <1, 19, 11, 6>; Chord: (11, 19)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: Cycle 6 <2, 7, 5, 12>; Chord: (5, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: Cycle 8 <2, 7, 10, 5>; Chord: (5, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: Cycle 16 <3, 18, 16, 15>; Chord: (3, 16)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: Cycle 26 <7, 8, 2, 18>; Chord: (2, 18)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 29 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [7].
