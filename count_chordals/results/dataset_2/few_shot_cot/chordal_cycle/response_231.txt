Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Found 8 chordal 4-cycles:
  <0, 8, 1, 3>, chord: (8, 1)
  <1, 8, 7, 12>, chord: (8, 7)
  <2, 6, 5, 9>, chord: (6, 9)
  <4, 1, 8, 13>, chord: (1, 8)
  <5, 6, 2, 8>, chord: (6, 8)
  <7, 10, 0, 8>, chord: (10, 8)
  <9, 5, 6, 2>, chord: (5, 6)
  <10, 14, 11, 4>, chord: (14, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
