Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 6, 7>
2. <0, 1, 3, 7>
3. <0, 1, 6, 7, 4>
4. <0, 3, 5, 2>
5. <0, 3, 4, 9>
6. <0, 3, 4, 8>
7. <0, 6, 1, 3>
8. <0, 6, 1, 3, 4>
9. <0, 6, 7, 9>
10. <2, 5, 3, 4>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 1, 6, 7> -> Chord: (1, 6)
2. <0, 1, 3, 7> -> Chord: (1, 7)
3. <0, 1, 6, 7, 4> -> Chord: (6, 4)
4. <0, 3, 5, 2> -> Chord: (5, 2)
5. <0, 3, 4, 9> -> Chord: (4, 9)
6. <0, 3, 4, 8> -> Chord: (4, 8)
7. <0, 6, 1, 3> -> Chord: (1, 3)
8. <0, 6, 7, 9> -> Chord: (7, 9)
9. <2, 5, 3, 4> -> Chord: (5, 3)

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [9].
