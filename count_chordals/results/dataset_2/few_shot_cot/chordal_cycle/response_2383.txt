Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 4, 9, 1>
- <0, 4, 9, 13>
- <0, 4, 6, 5>
- <0, 4, 14, 10>
- <1, 9, 8, 13>
- <1, 9, 13, 5>
- <1, 7, 12, 10>
- <2, 8, 9, 13>
- <2, 8, 6, 5>
- <2, 8, 9, 1>
- <2, 7, 12, 10>
- <2, 4, 0, 10>
- <2, 4, 6, 5>
- <3, 6, 4, 14>
- <3, 6, 5, 13>
- <3, 4, 9, 13>
- <4, 9, 13, 12>
- <4, 9, 7, 12>
- <4, 9, 1, 11>
- <4, 6, 5, 11>
- <4, 6, 8, 9>
- <4, 6, 3, 14>
- <4, 0, 12, 10>
- <4, 0, 10, 2>
- <4, 14, 12, 7>
- <5, 6, 8, 9>
- <5, 6, 4, 9>
- <5, 6, 8, 13>
- <5, 6, 3, 14>
- <5, 13, 9, 8>
- <7, 9, 8, 13>
- <7, 9, 1, 11>
- <7, 12, 10, 14>
- <8, 9, 13, 12>
- <8, 13, 12, 10>
- <10, 12, 7, 9>
- <12, 13, 9, 1>

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord (4-cycles with one chord):
- <0, 4, 9, 1> with chord (9, 13)
- <0, 4, 6, 5> with chord (4, 9)
- <0, 4, 14, 10> with chord (4, 9)
- <1, 9, 8, 13> with chord (9, 4)
- <1, 9, 13, 5> with chord (9, 4)
- <1, 7, 12, 10> with chord (1, 9)
- <2, 8, 6, 5> with chord (8, 9)
- <2, 7, 12, 10> with chord (7, 9)
- <2, 4, 6, 5> with chord (4, 9)
- <4, 6, 5, 11> with chord (6, 8)
- <4, 0, 12, 10> with chord (4, 9)
- <4, 14, 12, 7> with chord (12, 10)
- <5, 6, 8, 9> with chord (6, 4)
- <5, 13, 9, 8> with chord (13, 12)
- <7, 9, 1, 11> with chord (9, 8)
- <8, 13, 12, 10> with chord (13, 9)
- <12, 13, 9, 1> with chord (13, 8)

Step 3:
