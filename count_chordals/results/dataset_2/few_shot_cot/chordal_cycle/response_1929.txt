Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <1, (5, 9), 4>
- <1, (5, 9), 8>
- <1, (5, 9), 0>
- <1, 7, (5, 9)>
- <1, 7, (5, 8)>
- <1, 3, (9, 4)>
- <1, 3, (9, 8)>
- <1, 6, (5, 9)>
- <3, (9, 8), 5>
- <4, 9, (5, 1)>
- <4, 9, (8, 5)>
- <7, 5, (1, 7)>
- <7, 5, (8, 9)>
- <8, 5, (1, 7)>
- <8, 5, (9, 4)>
- <8, 5, (9, 0)>
- <8, 5, (9, 3)>
- <8, 5, (6, 3)>
- <8, (9, 3), 0>
- <6, 5, (1, 3)>
- <6, 5, (9, 4)>
- <6, 5, (3, 9)>
