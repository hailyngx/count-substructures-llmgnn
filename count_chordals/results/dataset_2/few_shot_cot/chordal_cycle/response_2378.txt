Response:
Step 1: 
From the given graph, we identify the cycles of length 4 or more:

<1, 0, 5, 11>
<1, 5, 11, 18>
<1, 5, 4, 3>
<1, 3, 4, 5>
<2, 18, 11, 5>
<2, 18, 13, 17>
<2, 12, 17, 1>
<2, 12, 6, 3>
<2, 12, 7, 17>
<2, 14, 15, 12>
<3, 6, 12, 2>
<3, 4, 5, 0>
<4, 5, 0, 1>
<4, 5, 11, 18>
<6, 16, 9, 13>
<6, 3, 1, 5>
<6, 12, 7, 17>
<6, 12, 2, 18>
<9, 16, 6, 3>
<11, 18, 13, 17>
<12, 2, 18, 13>
<12, 2, 14, 15>
<12, 17, 13, 18>
<15, 14, 2, 12>
<17, 1, 5, 0>
<17, 12, 7, 2>
<18, 2, 12, 7>
<18, 13, 17, 12>
<19, 18, 13, 17>

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 5, 11, 18> has a chord 1-18
- <2, 12, 7, 17> has a chord 2-17
- <15, 14, 2, 12> has a chord 14-12

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [27].
