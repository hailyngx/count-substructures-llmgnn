Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle: <0, 11, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 11, 4, 8, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 11, 4, 8, 12, 6, 13, 2, 7, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 11, 4, 8, 5, 7, 2, 13, 6, 12, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 11, 4, 8, 12, 6, 13, 10, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 11, 4, 1, 9, 2, 13, 6, 12, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 11, 4, 8, 12, 6, 13, 10, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 11, 3, 1, 9, 2, 7, 0>
- Cycle: <5, 8, 4, 11, 0, 12, 6, 13, 2, 7, 5>
- Cycle: <5, 8, 4, 11, 0, 12, 6, 13, 10, 5>
  
Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- In the cycle <0, 11, 4, 1, 0>, there is a chord: (1, 4)
- In the cycle <0, 11, 4, 8, 5, 7, 0>, there is a chord: (5, 7)
- In the cycle <0, 11, 4, 8, 12, 6, 13, 2, 7, 0>, there is no chord
- In the cycle <0, 11, 4, 8, 5, 7, 2, 13, 6, 12, 0>, there is no chord
- In the cycle <0, 11, 4, 8, 12, 6, 13, 10, 5, 7, 0>, there is no chord
- In the cycle <0, 11, 4, 1, 9, 2, 13, 6, 12, 0>, there is no chord
- In the cycle <0, 11, 4, 8, 12, 6, 13, 10, 0>, there is a chord: (10, 0)
- In the cycle <0, 11, 3, 1, 9, 2, 7, 0>, there is no chord
- In the cycle <5, 8, 4, 11, 0, 12, 6, 13, 2, 7, 5>, there is no chord
- In the cycle <5, 8, 4, 11, 0, 12, 6, 13, 10, 5>, there is no chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found.

So, the final count is [3].
