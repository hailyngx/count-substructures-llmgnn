Response:
Step 1: 

Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 8, 2, 14> with 0 as chord
- Cycle <0, 8, 7, 14> with 8 as chord
- Cycle <1, 6, 9, 7> with 6 as chord
- Cycle <1, 6, 10, 5> with 6 as chord
- Cycle <1, 9, 13, 3> with 9 as chord
- Cycle <2, 8, 7, 14> with 8 as chord
- Cycle <3, 10, 5, 12> with 10 as chord
- Cycle <4, 6, 10, 5> with 6 as chord
- Cycle <5, 10, 6, 9> with 10 as chord
- Cycle <7, 9, 13, 3> with 9 as chord
- Cycle <8, 6, 4, 12> with 6 as chord
- Cycle <9, 6, 4, 12> with 6 as chord
- Cycle <10, 6, 4, 12> with 6 as chord

Step 2:

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <0, 8, 2, 14>, chord: (0, 2)
- <1, 6, 9, 7>, chord: (6, 9)
- <1, 6, 10, 5>, chord: (6, 10)
- <3, 10, 5, 12>, chord: (10, 5)
- <8, 6, 4, 12>, chord: (6, 4)

Step 3:

The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
