Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 2, 14, 0> (length 4)
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 12, 11, 1, 7, 14, 0> (length 7)
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 12, 11, 6, 5, 13, 2, 14, 0> (length 9)
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 14, 13, 3, 10, 4, 1> (length 7)
- Cycle 5: <2, 9, 0, 14, 13, 3, 10, 4, 2> (length 8)
- Cycle 6: <3, 8, 10, 4, 1, 11, 2, 13, 3> (length 8)
- Cycle 7: <4, 10, 3, 7, 14, 13, 5, 6, 4> (length 8)

Step 2: Checking for chords:
Checking cycle 1 <0, 9, 2, 14, 0>: 1 chord found (9, 14)
Checking cycle 2 <0, 9, 12, 11, 1, 7, 14, 0>: No chord found
Checking cycle 3 <0, 9, 12, 11, 6, 5, 13, 2, 14, 0>: 1 chord found (11, 2)
Checking cycle 4 <1, 7, 14, 13, 3, 10, 4, 1>: No chord found
Checking cycle 5 <2, 9, 0, 14, 13, 3, 10, 4, 2>: 1 chord found (9, 14)
Checking cycle 6 <3, 8, 10, 4, 1, 11, 2, 13, 3>: No chord found
Checking cycle 7 <4, 10, 3, 7, 14, 13, 5, 6, 4>: No chord found

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 9, 2, 14, 0>
<0, 9, 12, 11, 1, 7, 14, 0>
<1, 7, 14, 13, 3, 10, 4, 1>
<4, 10, 3, 7, 14, 13, 5, 6, 4>
