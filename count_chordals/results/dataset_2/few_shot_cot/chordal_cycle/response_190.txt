Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Based on the provided edges, the possible cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- (1, 3, 2, 5, 1)
- (1, 3, 8, 9, 1)
- (1, 6, 2, 5, 1)
- (1, 6, 2, 7, 1)
- (1, 6, 3, 8, 1)

Step 2:
From the possible cycles listed above, we can identify the unique chordal 4-cycles as follows:
- <1, 3, 2, 5> with chord (1, 3)
- <1, 3, 8, 9> with chord (1, 8)
- <1, 6, 2, 5> with chord (1, 6)
- <1, 6, 2, 7> with chord (1, 2)

Step 3:
Since all the identified cycles have exactly one chord, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
