Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <0, 1, 21, 27, 4> has the chord (1, 27)
- <0, 5, 4, 27, 25> has the chord (4, 25)
- <0, 17, 26, 24> has the chord (17, 24)
- <1, 21, 27, 25, 2> has the chord (21, 25)
- <1, 28, 20, 3, 9> has the chord (20, 9)
- <1, 21, 15, 8, 3> has the chord (15, 8)
- <2, 29, 19, 7, 9> has the chord (19, 7)
- <2, 25, 27, 21, 1> has the chord (27, 1)
- <4, 27, 21, 15, 8> has the chord (21, 15)
- <5, 0, 17, 26, 24> has the chord (17, 26)
- <15, 21, 27, 25, 2> has the chord (21, 25)
- <19, 29, 2, 25, 9> has the chord (2, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 86 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [86].
