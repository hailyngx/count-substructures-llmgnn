Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 3, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <6, 1, 4, 5, 6>
- Cycle 2: <6, 4, 7, 2, 6>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 0, 2, 1>
- Cycle 4: <4, 7, 2, 5, 4>
- Cycle 5: <6, 2, 5, 4, 6>
- Cycle 6: <6, 4, 1, 3, 6>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 8: <4, 7, 2, 8, 4>
- Cycle 9: <4, 1, 3, 0, 4>
- Cycle 10: <6, 1, 9, 2, 6>
- Cycle 11: <3, 0, 8, 5, 3>
- Cycle 12: <6, 2, 9, 1, 6>
- Cycle 13: <3, 5, 8, 0, 3>
- Cycle 14: <4, 8, 0, 5, 4>
- Cycle 15: <4, 5, 1, 6, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The unique chordal 4-cycle is: <6, (2, 4), 5> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There is 14 chordless cycles.

Final answer: [14]
