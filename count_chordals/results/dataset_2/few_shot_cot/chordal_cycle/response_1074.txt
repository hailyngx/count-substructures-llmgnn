Next, let's identify the chordal 4-cycle by checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 5, 6, 24, 26, 20> has chord (24, 26)
- <1, 2, 13, 9, 22> has chord (13, 22)
- <1, 2, 13, 9, 14, 3> has chord (9, 14)
- <1, 2, 13, 22, 5, 6> has chord (13, 22)
- <1, 2, 13, 22, 25, 27, 24> has chord (13, 22)
- <1, 18, 26, 20, 11> has chord (18, 26)
- <1, 19, 24, 6, 5> has chord (24, 6)
- <1, 19, 24, 27, 25, 22> has chord (24, 27)
- <1, 19, 24, 27, 25, 12, 14> has chord (24, 27)
- <1, 19, 24, 27, 28, 12, 25> has chord (24, 27)
- <3, 9, 14, 12, 28, 4> has chord (9, 14)
- <4, 7, 1, 19, 24> has chord (7, 19)
- <4, 21, 13, 22, 25, 12> has chord (13, 22)
- <4, 28, 27, 24, 6> has chord (27, 6)
- <5, 15, 24, 6, 17> has chord (15, 6)
- <5, 22, 25, 12, 14, 9> has chord (22, 12)
- <7, 1, 18, 26, 23> has chord (1, 26)
- <9, 22, 13, 21, 10> has chord (13, 21)
- <9, 22, 13, 2, 1> has chord (13, 2)
- <9, 22, 13, 2, 16, 10> has chord (13, 2)
- <12, 25, 27, 24, 6, 5> has chord (25, 6)
- <14, 3, 9, 22, 25, 27> has chord (9, 25)
- <14, 12, 25, 27, 24, 6> has chord (25, 6)

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 5, 6, 24, 26, 20>
<3, 9, 14, 12, 28, 4>
<4, 21, 13, 22, 25, 12>
<5, 15, 24, 6, 17>
<7, 1, 18, 26, 23>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [40].
