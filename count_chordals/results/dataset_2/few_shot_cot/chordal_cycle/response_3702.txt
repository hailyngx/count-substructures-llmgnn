Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 16, 11, 7>
- <0, 16, 15, 9>
- <0, 16, 15, 10>
- <0, 7, 11, 18>
- <0, 7, 3, 14>
- <0, 7, 3, 13>
- <0, 6, 18, 11>
- <0, 10, 4, 12>
- <1, 14, 17, 18>
- <1, 14, 3, 13>
- <1, 9, 15, 10>
- <1, 9, 4, 12>
- <2, 13, 5, 4>
- <2, 13, 3, 14>
- <2, 12, 4, 10>
- <3, 7, 11, 19>

- <2, 10, 4, 12> (chord: (2, 12))
- <1, 9, 15, 10> (chord: (9, 15))
- <0, 10, 15, 16> (chord: (0, 16))
- <0, 16, 15, 9> (chord: (0, 9))
- <0, 16, 15, 10> (chord: (0, 15))
