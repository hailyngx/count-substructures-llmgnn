Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 4, 9, 8, 0>
2. Cycle <1, 5, 2, 4, 1>
3. Cycle <2, 4, 9, 5, 2>
4. Cycle <3, 5, 9, 4, 3>
5. Cycle <4, 8, 9, 5, 4>
6. Cycle <5, 7, 0, 4, 5>
7. Cycle <6, 1, 5, 2, 6>
8. Cycle <7, 9, 5, 3, 7>
9. Cycle <8, 9, 5, 2, 8>
10. Cycle <9, 7, 5, 1, 9>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (thus forming chordal 4-cycles) are:
1. Chordal cycle <1, 5, (2, 4), 1>
2. Chordal cycle <2, 4, (9, 5), 2>
3. Chordal cycle <4, 8, (9, 5), 4>
4. Chordal cycle <5, 7, (9, 3), 5>
5. Chordal cycle <6, 1, (5, 2), 6>
6. Chordal cycle <7, 9, (5, 3), 7>
7. Chordal cycle <8, 9, (5, 2), 8>
8. Chordal cycle <9, 7, (5, 1), 9>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [2].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, 5, (2, 4), 1>
