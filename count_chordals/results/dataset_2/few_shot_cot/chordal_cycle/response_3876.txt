Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <5, 11, 9, 6>.  

To count the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph, we first need to list all cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 11 - 9 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 11 - 3 - 14 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 0 - 7 - 17 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 0 - 8 - 13 - 5
- Cycle 5: 5 - 0 - 4 - 19 - 5
- Cycle 6: 11 - 9 - 6 - 10 - 11
- Cycle 7: 11 - 9 - 12 - 2 - 11
- Cycle 8: 11 - 3 - 13 - 1 - 11
- Cycle 9: 9 - 6 - 1 - 17 - 9
- Cycle 10: 9 - 6 - 10 - 12 - 9
- Cycle 11: 9 - 11 - 5 - 0 - 9
- Cycle 12: 6 - 10 - 12 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 13: 6 - 1 - 18 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 14: 6 - 9 - 11 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 15: 10 - 12 - 9 - 11 - 10
- Cycle 16: 10 - 6 - 9 - 11 - 10
- Cycle 17: 12 - 9 - 11 - 3 - 12
- Cycle 18: 12 - 10 - 6 - 9 - 12

From these cycles, we see that the unique chordal 4-cycle <5, 11, 9, 6> is the only cycle with exactly one chord. 
Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
