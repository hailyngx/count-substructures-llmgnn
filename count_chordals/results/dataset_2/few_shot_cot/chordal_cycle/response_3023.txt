Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 7, 5, 13>
- <0, 7, 3, 11>
- <0, 7, 14, 2>
- <1, 5, 12, 9>
- <1, 5, 11, 3>
- <1, 5, 12, 13>
- <2, 8, 9, 4>
- <2, 8, 10, 13>
- <2, 8, 10, 9>
- <2, 12, 13, 5>
- <2, 12, 9, 4>
- <2, 12, 13, 10>
- <3, 11, 5, 13>
- <4, 8, 10, 13>

- <9, 4, 8, 2>
- <9, 4, 10, 13>
- <9, 4, 8, 10>
- <10, 8, 2, 12>
- <10, 8, 4, 9>
- <10, 8, 4, 6>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 7, 5, 13>, with chord (7, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 7, 3, 11>, with chord (7, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 5, 12, 9>, with chord (5, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, 8, 9, 4>, with chord (8, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, 8, 10, 13>, with chord (8, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, 12, 13, 5>, with chord (12, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <4, 8, 10, 13>, with chord (8, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, 11, 5, 12>, with chord (11, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, 14, 7, 5>, with chord (14, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <10, 8, 2, 12>, with chord (8, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <10, 13, 5, 12>, with chord (13, 5)
  
Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
