Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 3, 9, 0>
- Cycle 3: <2, 8, 4, 3, 2>
- Cycle 4: <3, 4, 8, 6, 3>
- Cycle 5: <3, 7, 1, 9, 3>
- Cycle 6: <5, 6, 8, 2, 5>
- Cycle 7: <3, 5, 2, 0, 3>
- Cycle 8: <6, 7, 1, 9, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- From Cycle 1, the chord <4, 2> is present.
- From Cycle 2, the chord <4, 9> is present.
- From Cycle 3, the chord <8, 3> is present.
- From Cycle 4, the chord <4, 6> is present.
- From Cycle 5, the chord <7, 1> is present.
- From Cycle 6, the chord <6, 8> is present.
- From Cycle 7, the chord <5, 2> is present.
- From Cycle 8, the chord <7, 1> is present.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in the given graph.

Hence, the final count is [0].
