Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 5, 9, 4, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (3, 5, 9, 4, 0, 3)
- Cycle 3: (0, 4, 9, 5, 2, 7, 0)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 5: (6, 5, 2, 1, 6)
- Cycle 6: (8, 1, 2, 7, 8)
- Cycle 7: (4, 9, 6, 5, 4)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (5, 2)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (9, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which are chordless:
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles found in the given graph.

Putting it all together, the final count is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, 9, 4, 7> with chord (5, 9)
- <3, 5, 9, 4> with chord (5, 9)
- <0, 4, 9, 5> with chord (4, 7)
- <1, 6, 7, 2> with chord (6, 7)
- <6, 5, 2, 1> with chord (5, 2)
- <8, 1, 2, 7> with chord (1, 7)
- <4, 9, 6, 5> with chord (9, 6)
