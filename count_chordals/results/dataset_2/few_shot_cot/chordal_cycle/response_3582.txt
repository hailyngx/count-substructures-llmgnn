Response:
Step 1: 
We identify all cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: Node 5 - Node 6 - Node 11 - Node 5
- Cycle 2: Node 5 - Node 10 - Node 12 - Node 5
- Cycle 3: Node 5 - Node 2 - Node 7 - Node 5
- Cycle 4: Node 5 - Node 8 - Node 14 - Node 5
- Cycle 5: Node 6 - Node 8 - Node 12 - Node 6
- Cycle 6: Node 6 - Node 5 - Node 2 - Node 6
- Cycle 7: Node 6 - Node 11 - Node 13 - Node 6
- Cycle 8: Node 7 - Node 4 - Node 9 - Node 7
- Cycle 9: Node 7 - Node 2 - Node 1 - Node 7
- Cycle 10: Node 7 - Node 1 - Node 9 - Node 7
- Cycle 11: Node 8 - Node 5 - Node 6 - Node 8
- Cycle 12: Node 8 - Node 6 - Node 11 - Node 8
- Cycle 13: Node 8 - Node 12 - Node 0 - Node 8
- Cycle 14: Node 8 - Node 14 - Node 10 - Node 8
- Cycle 15: Node 9 - Node 4 - Node 0 - Node 9
- Cycle 16: Node 9 - Node 1 - Node 7 - Node 9
- Cycle 17: Node 10 - Node 5 - Node 6 - Node 10
- Cycle 18: Node 10 - Node 12 - Node 7 - Node 10
- Cycle 19: Node 10 - Node 0 - Node 4 - Node 10

Step 2:
Let's identify the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (6, 11), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (10, 12), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <7, (2, 1), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, (6, 11), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <8, (12, 0), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <8, (14, 10), 8>

Step 3:
There are a total of 6 unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord in the given graph. Therefore, the final count is [6].
