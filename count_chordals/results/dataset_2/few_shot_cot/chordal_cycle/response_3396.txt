Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
The chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <4, 7, 5, 8>. 

Now let's count the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph:
[8]
