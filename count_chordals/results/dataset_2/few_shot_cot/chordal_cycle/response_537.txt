Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 7, 4>, Chord: (9, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 11, 2, 8>, Chord: (11, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <9, 7, 4, 12>, Chord: (7, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <6, 9, 7, 4>, Chord: (9, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 60 cycles found and 4 of them are chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is 60 - 4 = 56.
Thus, the final answer is [56].
