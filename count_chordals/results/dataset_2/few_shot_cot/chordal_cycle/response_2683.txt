Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 2 - 6 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 3 - 0 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 4 - 1 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 4: 2 - 1 - 8 - 5 - 2
- Cycle 5: 4 - 1 - 7 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 6: 7 - 9 - 8 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 7: 6 - 7 - 9 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 8: 0 - 3 - 7 - 6 - 0

Step 2: Checking for chordality in each cycle:
- Checking Cycle 1: <1, (4, 2), 3>
- Checking Cycle 2: <2, (0, 8), 5>
- Checking Cycle 3: <3, (5, 1), 7>
- Checking Cycle 4: <4, (8, 2), 5>
- Checking Cycle 5: <5, (4, 6), 7>
- Checking Cycle 6: <6, (9, 1), 8>
- Checking Cycle 7: <7, (8, 9), 6>
- Checking Cycle 8: <8, (0, 7), 3>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are a total of [8] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
