Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

The cycles in the graph are:
1. (5, 9, 1, 12)
2. (5, 9, 2, 6)
3. (5, 9, 1, 13)
4. (5, 12, 3, 10)
5. (5, 7, 8, 11)
6. (9, 2, 3, 4)
7. (9, 1, 8, 7)
8. (9, 14, 11, 12)
9. (4, 13, 0, 6)
10. (4, 13, 1, 9)
11. (4, 14, 11, 12)
12. (7, 8, 11, 12)
13. (12, 3, 4, 13)
14. (12, 1, 13, 4)
15. (0, 11, 12, 1)
16. (0, 13, 1, 9)
17. (0, 6, 2, 9)
18. (14, 9, 1, 13)
19. (14, 4, 3, 12)
20. (14, 6, 0, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. 

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
1. <5, 9, 1, 12, (2, 6)>
2. <9, 2, 3, 4, (1, 13)>
3. <9, 1, 8, 7, (5, 12)>
4. <4, 13, 0, 6, (1, 9)>
5. <12, 1, 13, 4, (3, 10)>
6. <0, 11, 12, 1, (6, 9)>
7. <14, 9, 1, 13, (4, 3)>
8. <14, 6, 0, 13, (9, 1)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].
