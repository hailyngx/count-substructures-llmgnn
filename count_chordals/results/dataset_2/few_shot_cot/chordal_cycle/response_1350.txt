Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 7, 19, 4>
2. <0, 7, 18, 11>
3. <0, 6, 8, 16>
4. <0, 9, 11, 4>
5. <1, 3, 1, 19>
6. <1, 2, 18, 11>
7. <1, 19, 7, 18>
8. <2, 1, 19, 4>
9. <2, 18, 11, 4>
10. <2, 16, 8, 6>
11. <4, 19, 7, 18>
12. <4, 10, 16, 2>
13. <4, 11, 18, 7>
14. <5, 7, 18, 11>
15. <5, 15, 9, 11>
16. <6, 0, 7, 18>
17. <6, 8, 16, 2>
18. <7, 0, 6, 8>
19. <7, 18, 11, 4>
20. <8, 6, 0, 7>
21. <8, 10, 16, 2>
22. <9, 0, 7, 18>
23. <9, 11, 18, 7>
24. <9, 15, 5, 7>
25. <10, 2, 16, 8>
26. <10, 4, 11, 18>
27. <11, 18, 7, 0>
28. <11, 4, 19, 1>
29. <12, 2, 16, 8>
30. <12, 17, 13, 4>
31. <13, 4, 19, 1>
32. <13, 17, 12, 2>
33. <14, 9, 15, 5>
34. <15, 5, 7, 0>
35. <15, 9, 0, 6>
36. <16, 2, 12, 17>
37. <17, 18, 7, 0>
38. <17, 12, 2, 1>
39. <18, 2, 1, 3>
40. <19, 1, 3, 1>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, 7, 18, 11>
2. <0, 6, 8, 16>
3. <1, 19, 7, 18>
4. <2, 18, 11, 4>
5. <5, 15, 9, 11>
6. <6, 0, 7, 18>
7. <8, 6, 0, 7>
8. <9, 0, 7, 18>

Step 3:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [8].
