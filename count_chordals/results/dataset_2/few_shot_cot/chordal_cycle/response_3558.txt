Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 0) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (5, 1, 3, 7, 9)
        - Cycle 2: (1, 3, 0, 4, 7)
        - Cycle 3: (4, 8, 4)
        - Cycle 4: (5, 0, 6, 9)
        - Cycle 5: (0, 6, 9, 7)
        - Cycle 6: (2, 1, 5, 9)
        - Cycle 7: (2, 3, 7, 9)
        - Cycle 8: (2, 4, 9, 5)
        - Cycle 9: (2, 4, 7, 9)
        - Cycle 10: (3, 1, 5, 9)
        - Cycle 11: (3, 2, 9, 4)
        - Cycle 12: (3, 4, 7, 9)
        - Cycle 13: (0, 5, 9, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - <1, (3, 7), 9> with chord (3, 7) in cycle (5, 1, 3, 7, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There is one chordal 4-cycle found with exactly one chord.

Putting the final count inside brackets, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
