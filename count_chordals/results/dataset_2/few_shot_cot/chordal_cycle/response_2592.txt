Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 7, 3, 2, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 7, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 0, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 6, 7, 1>
- Cycle 6: <3, 2, 6, 7, 3>
- Cycle 7: <3, 8, 9, 6, 3>
- Cycle 8: <4, 6, 2, 3, 4>
- Cycle 9: <7, 5, 1, 3, 7>
- Cycle 10: <7, 3, 8, 9, 7>
- Cycle 11: <7, 0, 5, 1, 7>
- Cycle 12: <2, 6, 4, 1, 2>
- Cycle 13: <2, 3, 8, 0, 2>
- Cycle 14: <8, 9, 6, 2, 8>
- Cycle 15: <0, 5, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 16: <0, 9, 8, 3, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <5, 1, 4, 6, 5> has the chord (1, 4).
- The cycle <5, 7, 3, 2, 5> has the chord (3, 2).
- The cycle <5, 7, 4, 6, 5> has the chord (4, 6).
- The cycle <5, 0, 9, 8, 5> has the chord (0, 9).
- The cycle <1, 4, 6, 7, 1> has the chord (4, 7).
- The cycle <3, 2, 6, 7, 3> has the chord (2, 7).
- The cycle <3, 8, 9, 6, 3> has the chord (8, 9).
- The cycle <4, 6, 2, 3, 4> has the chord (2, 3).
- The cycle <7, 5, 1, 3, 7> has the chord (1, 3).
- The cycle <7, 3, 8, 9, 7> has the chord (8, 9).
- The cycle <7, 0, 5, 1, 7> has the chord (0, 5).
- The cycle <2, 6, 4, 1, 2> has the chord (4, 1).
- The cycle <2, 3, 8, 0, 2> has the chord (8, 0).
- The cycle <8, 9, 6, 2, 8> has the chord (6, 2).
- The cycle <0, 5, 7, 4, 0> has the chord (5, 7).
- The cycle <0, 9, 8, 3, 0> has the chord (9, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Since all cycles found have chords, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
