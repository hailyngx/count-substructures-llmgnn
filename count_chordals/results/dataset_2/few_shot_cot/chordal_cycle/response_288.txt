Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 0, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 0, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <0, 9, 5, 8, 7, 2, 6, 3>  
2. <1, 4, 6, 2, 7>
3. <2, 7, 1, 4, 6>
4. <3, 5, 9, 6>
5. <5, 8, 6, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (8, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
