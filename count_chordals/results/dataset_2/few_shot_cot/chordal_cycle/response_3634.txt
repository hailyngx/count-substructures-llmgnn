Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is <11, 16, 7, 19>.

To count the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph, we need to find cycles of length 4 or more and check for the presence of a chord in each cycle.

Here are the cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle: 1-3-17-1 with chord (1, 17)
2. Cycle: 2-16-7-2 with chord (2, 7)
3. Cycle: 3-17-1-3 with chord (1, 17)
4. Cycle: 3-17-1-19 with chord (1, 19)
5. Cycle: 3-17-11-12 with chord (11, 12)
6. Cycle: 3-17-11-16 with chord (11, 16)
7. Cycle: 3-14-5-12 with chord (5, 12)
8. Cycle: 3-14-5-5 with chord (5, 5)
9. Cycle: 3-14-5-14 with chord (5, 14)
10. Cycle: 5-12-11-16 with chord (11, 16)
11. Cycle: 5-14-3-17 with chord (3, 17)
12. Cycle: 5-14-3-6 with chord (3, 6)
13. Cycle: 5-14-3-6 with chord (3, 6)
14. Cycle: 6-19-1-3 with chord (1, 3)
15. Cycle: 6-19-1-17 with chord (1, 17)
16. Cycle: 11-12-5-14 with chord (5, 14)
17. Cycle: 11-16-7-19 with chord (7, 19)

There are 17 chordless cycles found. Therefore, the final count of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [17].
