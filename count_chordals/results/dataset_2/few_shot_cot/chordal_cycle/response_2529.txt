Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 14) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (4, 6) (4, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 0) (14, 13) (3, 0) (3, 10) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 0) (11, 1) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 10) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 13) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 10) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (10, 3) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 13)

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 8, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 11, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 14, 4, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (6, 1, 0, 14, 5, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 1, 11, 5, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 13, 12, 5, 14, 13, 6)
- Cycle 7: (7, 13, 6, 5, 8, 7)
- Cycle 8: (8, 7, 1, 6, 5, 14, 8)
- Cycle 9: (0, 14, 13, 12, 5, 9, 0)
- Cycle 10: (3, 0, 14, 5, 9, 11, 1, 3)
- Cycle 11: (4, 6, 1, 0, 14, 13, 4)
- Cycle 12: (10, 3, 0, 14, 13, 10)
- Cycle 13: (10, 2, 6, 5, 14, 13, 12, 10)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (9, 8), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, (9, 11), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (14, 4), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <6, (1, 11), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6, (13, 12), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <7, (13, 6), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <8, (7, 1), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <10, (3, 0), 14>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 5 chordless 4-cycles.

Final answer: [5]
