Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
   - <0, 3, 4, 6>
   - <0, 3, 5, 6>
   - <0, 3, 4, 8>
   - <0, 10, 4, 8>
   - <0, 10, 1, 3>
   - <0, 11, 1, 3>
   - <0, 11, 2, 7>
   - <1, 3, 4, 10>
   - <1, 3, 17, 2>
   - <1, 3, 17, 19>
   - <1, 11, 2, 7>
   - <1, 11, 4, 10>
   - <1, 11, 2, 12>
   - <2, 7, 13, 14>
   - <2, 7, 19, 17>
   - <2, 11, 4, 10>
   - <2, 11, 1, 3>
   - <3, 5, 6, 4>
   - <3, 4, 8, 13>
   - <3, 4, 10, 1>
   - <3, 4, 11, 1>
   - <4, 6, 5, 15>
   - <4, 6, 5, 19>
   - <4, 10, 1, 17>
   - <4, 10, 0, 3>
   - <4, 11, 1, 17>
   - <5, 19, 17, 2>
   - <5, 19, 7, 13>
   - <7, 13, 8, 14>
   - <10, 1, 17, 2>
   - <10, 0, 3, 4>
   - <11, 1, 17, 3>
   - <12, 2, 7, 19>
   - <17, 19, 7, 13>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
   - <0, 3, 4, 6> - Chord: (3, 4)
   - <0, 11, 1, 3> - Chord: (1, 11)
   - <1, 3, 4, 10> - Chord: (3, 4)
   - <1, 11, 2, 7> - Chord: (2, 7)
   - <2, 7, 13, 14> - Chord: (7, 13)
   - <4, 6, 5, 15> - Chord: (5, 15)
   - <19, 7, 13, 17> - Chord: (7, 13)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
    There are 28 chordal 4-cycles in total, and 7 have exactly one chord. 
    Therefore, the number of chordless chordal 4-cycles is [21].
