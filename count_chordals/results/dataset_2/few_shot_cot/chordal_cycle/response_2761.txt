Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph with length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <11, 16, 7, 11>
- Cycle 2: <11, 7, 17, 11>
- Cycle 3: <11, 7, 8, 11>
- Cycle 4: <11, 5, 15, 11>
- Cycle 5: <16, 14, 9, 16>
- Cycle 6: <4, 8, 17, 4>
- Cycle 7: <6, 1, 10, 6>
- Cycle 8: <3, 11, 7, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 19, 1, 3>
- Cycle 10: <19, 6, 13, 19>
- Cycle 11: <5, 0, 15, 5>
- Cycle 12: <2, 18, 17, 2>
- Cycle 13: <18, 17, 11, 18>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <11, 7>
- Cycle 2 has a chord <11, 17>
- Cycle 6 has a chord <8, 17>
- Cycle 8 has a chord <11, 7>
- Cycle 9 has a chord <3, 1>
- Cycle 10 has a chord <19, 6>

Step 3:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <11, 16, 7, 11> with a chord (11, 7)
2. <11, 7, 17, 11> with a chord (11, 17)
3. <4, 8, 17, 4> with a chord (8, 17)
4. <3, 11, 7, 3> with a chord (11, 7)
5. <3, 19, 1, 3> with a chord (3, 1)
6. <19, 6, 13, 19> with a chord (19, 6)
