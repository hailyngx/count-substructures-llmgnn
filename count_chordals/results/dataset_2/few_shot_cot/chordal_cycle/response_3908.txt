Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle: <3, 15, 0, 13, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 15, 4, 17, 6, 1, 16, 5, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 15, 0, 17, 6, 1, 16, 18, 14, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 5, 16, 1, 6, 17, 4, 15, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 8, 0, 17, 6, 1, 16, 5, 2, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 5, 11, 19, 9, 4, 17, 6, 8, 2, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 5, 11, 19, 9, 4, 15, 0, 8, 2, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 15, 4, 9, 19, 11, 5, 2, 8, 0, 13, 14, 18, 16, 1, 6, 17, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 15, 0, 13, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 5, 11, 19, 9, 4, 17, 6, 8, 2, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 2 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [2].
