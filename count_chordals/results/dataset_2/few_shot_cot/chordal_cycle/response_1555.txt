Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- (1, 17, 3, 4, 14) <11, 10>
- (1, 8, 10, 16, 11) <14, 12>
- (1, 7, 12, 11, 14) <17, 4>
- (2, 17, 14, 4, 3) <1, 8>
- (3, 17, 2, 15, 12) <14, 4>
- (4, 3, 19, 13, 5) <18, 16>
- (6, 18, 7, 12, 11) <15, 2>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Hence, the final count is [7].
