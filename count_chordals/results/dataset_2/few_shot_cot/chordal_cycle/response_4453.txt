Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 2, 29, 21, 1, 20, 23, 16, 27, 11, 5, 12) 
- Cycle 2: (0, 2, 29, 21, 1, 20, 23, 16, 27, 11, 6, 3, 12) 
- Cycle 3: (0, 2, 29, 21, 1, 28, 9, 14, 24, 8, 27, 16, 23, 10, 12)
- Cycle 4: (0, 14, 24, 8, 27, 11, 5, 12, 3, 6, 4, 21, 29, 17)
- Cycle 5: (0, 14, 24, 8, 27, 16, 23, 10, 12, 5, 11, 19, 15, 13)
- Cycle 6: (1, 21, 29, 17, 4, 6, 3, 12, 5, 11, 27, 16, 23, 20)
- Cycle 7: (1, 21, 29, 17, 26, 18, 9, 14, 24, 8, 27, 11, 5, 12)
- Cycle 8: (1, 28, 22, 13, 15, 19, 11, 6, 3, 12, 5, 11, 27, 16)
- Cycle 9: (1, 28, 10, 23, 8, 27, 11, 5, 12, 3, 6, 4, 21, 22)
- Cycle 10: (2, 29, 17, 26, 7, 25, 8, 27, 16, 23, 10, 12, 3, 6)
- Cycle 11: (3, 12, 5, 11, 27, 16, 29, 21, 4, 6, 11, 19, 15, 13)
- Cycle 12: (4, 17, 29, 16, 27, 11, 5, 12, 3, 6, 21, 1, 28, 22)
- Cycle 13: (4, 6, 3, 12, 5, 11, 27, 16, 23, 20, 1, 21, 29, 17)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, (14, 24)> in Cycle 3
- <4, (21, 17)> in Cycle 4
- <5, (13, 15)> in Cycle 5
- <6, (4, 21)> in Cycle 6
- <7, (18, 26)> in Cycle 7
- <8, (1, 28)> in Cycle 8
- <9, (22, 21)> in Cycle 9
- <10, (20, 23)> in Cycle 10
- <11, (13, 15)> in Cycle 11
- <12, (4, 6)> in Cycle 12
- <13, (14, 21)> in Cycle 13

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0. Therefore, the final answer is [0].
