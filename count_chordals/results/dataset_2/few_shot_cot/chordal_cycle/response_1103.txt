Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 15, 10, 9, 6, 3, 8, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 15, 10, 9, 6, 3, 8, 5>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 8, 4, 13, 18, 16, 12>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 17, 9, 6, 3, 8, 4>
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 17, 11, 19, 5, 8, 4>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 17, 11, 19, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 7: <2, 19, 11, 17, 7, 1, 19, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 19, 11, 17, 9, 6, 3, 8>
- Cycle 9: <2, 19, 5, 16, 18, 13, 4, 14>
- Cycle 10: <3, 6, 9, 17, 11, 19, 5, 10>
- Cycle 11: <4, 8, 5, 19, 11, 17, 7, 1>
- Cycle 12: <4, 8, 15, 10, 9, 17, 7, 1>
- Cycle 13: <5, 10, 9, 17, 11, 19, 2, 14>
- Cycle 14: <8, 3, 6, 9, 17, 11, 19, 2>
- Cycle 15: <8, 3, 0, 15, 10, 9, 6, 3>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 15, 10, 9, 6, 3, 8, 4> [Chord: (0, 8)]
- <0, 15, 10, 9, 6, 3, 8, 5> [Chord: (0, 8)]
- <1, 7, 17, 9, 6, 3, 8, 4> [Chord: (1, 17)]
- <2, 19, 11, 17, 7, 1, 19, 2> [Chord: (2, 11)]
- <4, 8, 5, 19, 11, 17, 7, 1> [Chord: (4, 19)]
- <8, 3, 0, 15, 10, 9, 6, 3> [Chord: (8, 15)]

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 9 chordless cycles found, so the final answer is [9].
