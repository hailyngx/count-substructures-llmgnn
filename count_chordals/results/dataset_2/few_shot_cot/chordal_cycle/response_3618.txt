Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 4, 12, 23, 8> (length 6)
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 4, 26, 21, 24, 15, 0> (length 8)
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 4, 26, 11, 3, 13, 19, 6, 1, 27, 8> (length 12)
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 4, 26, 11, 19, 6, 17, 3, 13, 15, 24, 21, 5, 23, 12> (length 16)
- Cycle 5: <0, 18, 1, 27, 25, 28, 26, 4> (length 8)
- Cycle 6: <1, 18, 0, 7, 4, 26, 28, 25, 27> (length 9)
- Cycle 7: <1, 18, 0, 15, 24, 21, 26, 28, 25, 27> (length 10)
- Cycle 8: <1, 27, 25, 28, 26, 21, 24, 15, 0, 18> (length 10)
- Cycle 9: <1, 6, 17, 3, 13, 15, 24, 21, 26, 11, 19> (length 11)
- Cycle 10: <2, 12, 23, 8, 27, 1, 6, 19, 14, 5> (length 10)
- Cycle 11: <3, 13, 15, 24, 21, 26, 28, 25, 27, 1, 6, 17> (length 12)
- Cycle 12: <3, 11, 26, 28, 25, 27, 1, 18, 0, 15, 24, 21> (length 12)
- Cycle 13: <3, 11, 19, 6, 1, 27, 25, 28, 26, 21, 24, 15> (length 12)
- Cycle 14: <4, 26, 28, 25, 27, 1, 18, 0, 7> (length 9)
- Cycle 15: <5, 23, 12, 2, 20, 9, 17, 6, 1, 27, 8> (length 11)
- Cycle 16: <9, 20, 14, 29, 8, 23, 5, 21, 24, 15> (length 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 7, 4, 26, 21, 24, 15, 0> has exactly one chord (26, 11)
- <1, 6, 17, 3, 13, 15, 24, 21, 26, 11, 19> has exactly one chord (17, 13)
- <3, 11, 26, 28, 25, 27, 1, 18, 0, 15, 24, 21> has exactly one chord (11, 15)
- <5, 23, 12, 2, 20, 9, 17, 6, 1, 27, 8> has exactly one chord (23, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph, so the final count is [12].
