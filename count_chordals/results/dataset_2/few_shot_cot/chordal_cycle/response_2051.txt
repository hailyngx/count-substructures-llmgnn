Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 4, 8, 1, 5>
- <0, 4, 8, 3, 5>
- <0, 4, 5, 3, 0>
- <0, 7, 5, 1, 8>
- <2, 6, 4, 5, 3>
- <2, 6, 4, 8, 0>
- <2, 7, 5, 1, 7>
- <3, 8, 0, 4, 5>
- <3, 8, 4, 6, 2>
- <7, 5, 4, 6, 2>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 8, 1, 5> has one chord: (4, 8)
- <0, 4, 8, 3, 5> has one chord: (4, 8)
- <0, 4, 5, 3, 0> has one chord: (4, 5)
- <0, 7, 5, 1, 8> has one chord: (5, 8)
- <2, 6, 4, 8, 0> has one chord: (4, 8)
- <2, 7, 5, 1, 7> has one chord: (5, 7)
- <3, 8, 0, 4, 5> has one chord: (4, 5)
- <3, 8, 4, 6, 2> has one chord: (4, 6)
- <7, 5, 4, 6, 2> has one chord: (4, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 4, 8, 1, 5>
- <0, 4, 8, 3, 5>
- <0, 4, 5, 3, 0>
- <0, 7, 5, 1, 8>
- <2, 6, 4, 8, 0>
- <2, 7, 5, 1, 7>
- <3, 8, 0, 4, 5>
- <3, 8, 4, 6, 2>
- <7, 5, 4, 6, 2>
