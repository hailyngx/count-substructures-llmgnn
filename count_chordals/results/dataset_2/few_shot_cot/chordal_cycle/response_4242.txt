Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph where every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 7, 10, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 2, 10, 7, 6, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 11, 4, 2, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 2, 4, 11, 6, 1)
- Cycle 5: (6, 7, 17, 19, 10, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 11, 4, 16, 18, 6)
- Cycle 7: (7, 17, 19, 12, 5, 7)
- Cycle 8: (10, 7, 3, 18, 16, 10)
- Cycle 9: (10, 19, 17, 7, 10)
- Cycle 10: (3, 7, 10, 8, 18, 3)
- Cycle 11: (5, 15, 14, 9, 19, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 3, 7, 6, 11, 5)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
After checking, we find that the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- Cycle with chord: <1, (10, 7), 2>

Step 3:
Final number of chordless cycles found: [11]
