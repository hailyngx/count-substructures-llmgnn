Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: 
1. Cycle: <5, 9, 8, 4, 5> 
2. Cycle: <5, 1, 6, 7, 5> 
3. Cycle: <5, 2, 0, 4, 5> 
4. Cycle: <5, 6, 7, 1, 5> 
5. Cycle: <9, 8, 4, 3, 9> 
6. Cycle: <9, 4, 0, 5, 9> 
7. Cycle: <4, 8, 2, 0, 4> 
8. Cycle: <4, 0, 2, 6, 4> 
9. Cycle: <4, 3, 7, 6, 4> 
10. Cycle: <7, 6, 1, 5, 7> 
11. Cycle: <6, 1, 5, 2, 6> 
12. Cycle: <6, 3, 4, 0, 6> 

Step 2:
Upon checking each cycle, we find that only Cycle 7: <4, 8, 2, 0, 4> has exactly one chord <5, 6>.

Step 3:
As we have found 1 chordal 4-cycle, we can conclude that the number of chordless 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
