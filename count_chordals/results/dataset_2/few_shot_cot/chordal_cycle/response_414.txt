Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 1, 6> with chord (1, 6).
2. Cycle <5, 2, 1, 9> with chord (2, 9).
3. Cycle <5, 2, 3, 6> with chord (3, 6).
4. Cycle <5, 3, 2, 1> with chord (2, 3).
5. Cycle <5, 7, 6, 1> with chord (6, 7).
6. Cycle <5, 7, 4, 5> with chord (4, 7).
7. Cycle <5, 0, 9, 5> with chord (0, 9).
8. Cycle <5, 0, 8, 9> with chord (0, 8).
9. Cycle <6, 9, 8, 7> with chord (7, 8).
10. Cycle <7, 4, 5, 3> with chord (4, 5).
11. Cycle <8, 9, 5, 2> with chord (5, 9).
12. Cycle <8, 0, 5, 3> with chord (3, 5).
13. Cycle <8, 7, 5, 2> with chord (5, 7).
14. Cycle <1, 9, 8, 0> with chord (0, 8).

Step 2:
Count of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
