Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 2, 3, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 2, 6, 8, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 8, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 3, 6, 8, 9)
- Cycle 6: (4, 5, 7, 0, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 7, 8, 5, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 5, 9, 2, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <5, (2, 3), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordless cycles: [5]
