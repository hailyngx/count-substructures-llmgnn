Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 4, 7, 5, 1>
2. <0, 1, 5, 9, 8>
3. <0, 1, 5, 7, 4>
4. <0, 1, 12, 14, 10>
5. <0, 4, 7, 3, 9>
6. <0, 4, 9, 2, 6>
7. <1, 5, 9, 3, 7>
8. <1, 11, 6, 13, 10>
9. <2, 9, 5, 7, 4>
10. <2, 9, 10, 13, 6>
11. <3, 9, 5, 7, 4>
12. <3, 7, 5, 9, 8>
13. <4, 7, 5, 9, 8>
14. <6, 4, 7, 5, 9>
15. <6, 2, 9, 5, 1>
16. <6, 2, 10, 13, 0>
17. <6, 8, 9, 5, 7>
18. <6, 8, 12, 1, 5>
19. <7, 5, 9, 8, 12>
20. <9, 5, 1, 12, 14>
21. <10, 9, 5, 1, 11>
22. <10, 14, 12, 1, 5>
23. <11, 5, 7, 4, 9>
24. <11, 6, 8, 9, 5>
25. <13, 0, 4, 7, 5>
26. <13, 6, 2, 9, 5>
27. <13, 6, 8, 9, 5>
28. <14, 0, 4, 7, 5>
29. <14, 0, 1, 5, 9>
30. <14, 12, 8, 9, 5>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<0, 4, 7, 5, 9>

Step 3:
There is a total of 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final number inside brackets is [1].
