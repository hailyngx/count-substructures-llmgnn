Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 11) (9, 10) (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 13) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 12) (13, 1) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 7) (2, 14) (2, 11) (0, 7) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 12) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 2) (11, 0) (7, 3) (7, 13) (7, 0) (7, 14) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 0) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 14) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 0)

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the graph.

Step 2:
- Based on the adjacency list and edges given, the chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
    1. <2, (0, 11), 1>
    2. <5, (0, 12), 4>
    3. <7, (3, 13), 14>
    4. <10, (9, 6), 0>
    5. <11, (1, 9), 0>
    6. <12, (5, 8), 14>
    7. <13, (1, 4), 8>

Step 3:
- Count of the number of chordless cycles found = [0]
