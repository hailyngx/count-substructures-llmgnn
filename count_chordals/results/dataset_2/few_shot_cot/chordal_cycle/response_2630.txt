Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 2, 14, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <3, 2, 10, 5>
- Cycle 3: <3, 11, 6, 5>
- Cycle 4: <3, 11, 12, 4>
- Cycle 5: <3, 13, 7, 4>
- Cycle 6: <3, 13, 8, 0>
- Cycle 7: <3, 13, 14, 10>
- Cycle 8: <4, 7, 9, 8>
- Cycle 9: <6, 5, 10, 11>
- Cycle 10: <6, 5, 1, 14>
- Cycle 11: <6, 11, 3, 13>
- Cycle 12: <6, 13, 7, 4>
- Cycle 13: <7, 4, 12, 3>
- Cycle 14: <7, 8, 13, 3>
- Cycle 15: <10, 5, 6, 11>
- Cycle 16: <10, 5, 1, 14>
- Cycle 17: <10, 11, 6, 5>
- Cycle 18: <10, 14, 7, 13>
- Cycle 19: <11, 3, 12, 4>
- Cycle 20: <11, 3, 13, 7>
- Cycle 21: <11, 6, 13, 7>
- Cycle 22: <12, 4, 7, 13>
- Cycle 23: <13, 3, 12, 11>
- Cycle 24: <13, 3, 11, 6>
- Cycle 25: <13, 7, 4, 12>
- Cycle 26: <13, 7, 8, 3>
- Cycle 27: <14, 1, 5, 6>
- Cycle 28: <14, 2, 6, 5>
- Cycle 29: <14, 2, 3, 11>
- Cycle 30: <14, 2, 0, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: <0, 2, 14, 1, 5> has chord (2, 14)
- Cycle 2: <3, 2, 10, 5> has chord (2, 10)
- Cycle 10: <6, 5, 1, 14> has chord (5, 14)
- Cycle 14: <7, 8, 13, 3> has chord (8, 13)
- Cycle 30: <14, 2, 0, 8> has chord (2, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 30 cycles in total, 5 of which have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [25].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are: 
<0, 2, 14, 1>
<3, 2, 10, 5>
<3, 11, 6, 5>
<3, 11, 12, 4>
<3, 13, 7, 4>
<3, 13, 8, 0>
<3, 13, 14, 10>
<4, 7, 9, 8>
<6, 5, 10, 11>
<6, 11, 3, 13>
<10, 5, 6, 11>
<10, 5, 1, 14>
<10, 11, 6, 5>
<10, 14, 7, 13>
<11, 3, 12, 4>
<11, 6, 13, 7>
<12, 4, 7, 13>
<13, 3, 12, 11>
<13, 3, 11, 6>
<13, 7, 4, 12>
<14, 1, 5, 6>
<14, 2, 6, 5>
<14, 2, 3, 11>
