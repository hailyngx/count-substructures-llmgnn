Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 2, 18, 15, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 2, 18, 8, 17, 4, 3, 11, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 2, 18, 5, 12, 1, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 2, 18, 5, 7, 8, 17, 4, 3, 11, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 16, 6, 18, 2, 15, 10, 8, 17, 4, 3, 19, 17, 8, 10, 15, 0>
- Cycle 6: <3, 4, 17, 19, 3>
- Cycle 7: <5, 14, 13, 16, 6, 18, 5>
- Cycle 8: <5, 7, 8, 17, 4, 3, 11, 9, 12, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: <0, (2, 15), 18, 0>
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <0, (2, 18), 8, 17, 4, 3, 11, 0>
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <0, (2, 5), 12, 1, 0>
- Cycle 4 has a chord: <0, (2, 18), 7, 8, 17, 4, 3, 11, 0>
- Cycle 5 has a chord: <0, (6, 16), 18, 2, 15, 10, 8, 17, 4, 3, 19, 17, 8, 15, 0>
- Cycle 6 is a chordal 4-cycle: <3, 4, 17, 19, 3>
- Cycle 7 is a chordal 4-cycle: <5, 13, (14, 16), 6, 18, 5>
- Cycle 8 has a chord: <5, 7, 8, 17, 4, 3, 11, (9, 12), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [3] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
