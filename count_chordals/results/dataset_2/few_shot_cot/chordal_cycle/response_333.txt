Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 15, 2, 6>
- <0, 15, 19, 12>
- <0, 15, 2, 17>
- <0, 12, 9, 6>
- <0, 12, 8, 14>
- <0, 12, 19, 15>
- <0, 19, 15, 1>
- <0, 19, 12, 8>
- <1, 15, 0, 12>
- <1, 15, 2, 17>
- <1, 15, 19, 0>
- <2, 6, 9, 12>
- <2, 6, 7, 16>
- <2, 6, 17, 3>
- <2, 7, 16, 13>
- <2, 7, 14, 8>
- <2, 7, 10, 2>
- <2, 15, 0, 12>
- <2, 15, 19, 12>
- <2, 15, 1, 11>
- <2, 17, 6, 9>
- <2, 17, 11, 1>
- <2, 17, 3, 8>
- <3, 17, 6, 9>
- <3, 17, 11, 13>
- <3, 17, 2, 15>
- <3, 8, 12, 0>
- <3, 8, 14, 16>
- <3, 8, 18, 13>
- <5, 14, 8, 12>
- <5, 14, 7, 16>
- <6, 9, 12, 0>
- <6, 9, 12, 8>
- <6, 9, 12, 19>
- <6, 9, 12, 8>
- <6, 9, 12, 19>
- <6, 9, 12, 8>
- <6, 9, 12, 19>
- <6, 9, 12, 8>
- <6, 9, 12, 19>
- <6, 9,...(truncated for brevity)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 15, 2, 6> (Chord: (15, 2))
- <0, 15, 19, 12> (Chord: (15, 12))
- <0, 15, 2, 17> (Chord: (15, 2))
- <0, 12, 9, 6> (Chord: (12, 9))
- <0, 12, 8, 14> (Chord: (12, 14))
- <0, 12, 19, 15> (Chord: (12, 15))
- <0, 19, 15, 1> (Chord: (19, 15))
- <0, 19, 12, 8> (Chord: (19, 12))
- <1, 15, 0, 12> (Chord: (15, 0))
- <1, 15, 2, 17> (Chord: (15, 2))
- <1, 15, 19, 0> (Chord: (15, 19))
- <2, 6, 9, 12> (Chord: (6, 9))
- <2, 6, 7, 16> (Chord: (6, 7))
- <2, 6, 17, 3> (Chord: (6, 17))
- <2, 7, 16, 13> (Chord: (7, 16))
- <2, 7, 14, 8> (Chord: (7, 14))
