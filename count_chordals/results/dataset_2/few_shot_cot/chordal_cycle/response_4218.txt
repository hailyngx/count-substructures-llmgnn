Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- (2, 3, 4, 15)
- (2, 3, 12, 7)
- (2, 3, 11, 10)
- (2, 3, 18, 6)
- (2, 19, 14, 11)
- (2, 19, 5, 8, 7)
- (3, 4, 15, 2)
- (3, 4, 11, 10)
- (3, 12, 7, 17)
- (3, 18, 6, 16)
- (5, 19, 6, 16)
- (5, 19, 0, 1)
- (6, 18, 3, 2)
- (6, 18, 16, 13)
- (6, 19, 2, 9)
- (6, 19, 5, 8)
- (7, 9, 2, 3)
- (7, 9, 2, 19)
- (7, 12, 3, 4)
- (7, 12, 17, 10)
- (7, 12, 17, 13)
- (7, 17, 10, 11)
- (10, 11, 3, 2)
- (10, 11, 14, 19)
- (10, 17, 7, 12)
- (10, 17, 13, 16)
- (11, 14, 19, 5)
- (12, 3, 2, 9)
- (12, 3, 18, 6)
- (12, 7, 17, 13)
- (13, 17, 10, 11)
- (13, 16, 6, 18)
- (14, 11, 3, 2)
- (15, 4, 3, 12)
- (16, 6, 18, 3)
- (16, 8, 5, 19)
- (17, 7, 12, 3)
- (17, 7, 9, 2)
- (17, 10, 11, 3)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <2, 3, 12, 7> (Chord: 3-12)
- <5, 19, 6, 16> (Chord: 19-6)
- <7, 12, 17, 13> (Chord: 12-17)
- <10, 17, 7, 12> (Chord: 17-7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 36.
Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [36].
