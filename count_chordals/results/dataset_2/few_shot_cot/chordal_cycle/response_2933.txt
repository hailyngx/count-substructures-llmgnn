Node 18 is connected to node 4, 15, 16, and node 0
Node 19 is connected to node 10, 4, 13, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
<4, 14, 2, 11>, <4, 18, 0, 3>, <4, 18, 16, 2>, <7, 1, 14, 2>, <6, 13, 19, 4> are the cycles found.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, 14, 2, 11> has chord (14, 11)
- <4, 18, 0, 3> has chord (18, 3)
- <4, 18, 16, 2> has chord (18, 16)
- <7, 1, 14, 2> has chord (1, 14)
- <6, 13, 19, 4> has chord (13, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
5 cycles have exactly one chord, so the number of chordal 4-cycles is [0].
