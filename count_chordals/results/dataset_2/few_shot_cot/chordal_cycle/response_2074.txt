Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (1, 9, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 9, 4, 8, 7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 2, 1, 9)
- Cycle 5: (1, 5, 2, 1, 7, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 7, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 7, 3, 5, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 7, 3, 5, 6, 9, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 7, 3, 5, 8, 7)
- Cycle 10: (1, 7, 8, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 7, 8, 4, 9, 6, 3, 7, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 2, 5, 1)
- Cycle 13: (1, 2, 5, 3, 7, 1)
- Cycle 14: (1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 1)
- Cycle 15: (1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 16: (1, 2, 5, 8, 7, 1)
- Cycle 17: (2, 5, 3, 7, 2)
- Cycle 18: (2, 5, 1, 9, 4, 7, 2)
- Cycle 19: (2, 5, 1, 9, 6, 3, 7, 2)
- Cycle 20: (2, 5, 1, 7, 4, 9, 2)

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <1, (9, 4), 7>: No chord
- <1, (9, 4), 8, 7>: Chord: (9, 4)
- <1, (5, 2), 1>: No chord
- <1, (5, 2), 1, 9>: Chord: (5, 2)
- <1, (5, 2), 7, 4, 9>: Chord: (5, 2)
- <1, (7, 4), 9>: No chord
- <1, (7, 3), 5, 1>: Chord: (7, 3)
- <1, (7, 3), 5, 6, (9, 1)>: No chord
- <1, (7, 3), 5, 8, 7>: Chord: (7, 3)
- <1, (7, 8), 4, 9>: Chord: (7, 8)
- <1, (7, 8), (4, 9), 6, 3, 7>: No chord
- <1, (2, 5), 1>: No chord
- <1, (2, 5), 3, 7, 1>: No chord
- <1, (2, 5), 6, 9>: No chord
- <1, (2, 5), 6, 9, 4, 7>: Chord: (2, 5)
- <1, (2, 5), 8, 7>: Chord: (2, 5)
- <2, (5, 3), 7>: No chord
- <2, (5, 1), 9, 4, 7>: No chord
- <2, (5, 1), (9, 6), 3, 7>: No chord
- <2, (5, 1), 7, 4, 9>: Chord: (5, 1)

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles = [7]
