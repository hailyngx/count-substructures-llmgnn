Node 11 is connected to node 14, 2, and node 1
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 0, 14, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 3, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 8, 0, 11, 12, and node 10

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, 5, 1, 10>. 

After checking for exactly one chord, we find that the chord (0, 10) exists in the cycle. 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
