Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (6, 1, 3, 2, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 1, 3, 4, 9, 8, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 1, 3, 7, 9, 8, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 4: (6, 1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 5: (6, 2, 5, 8, 9, 4, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 6: (6, 2, 5, 0, 7, 9, 4, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 7: (6, 2, 5, 4, 9, 8, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 2, 5, 4, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 2, 5, 8, 9, 4, 7, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 2, 8, 5, 4, 7, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 0, 7, 9, 4, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 12: (6, 0, 7, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 13: (6, 0, 7, 4, 9, 8, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 14: (6, 0, 7, 4, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 15: (6, 0, 7, 3, 4, 9, 8, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 16: (6, 0, 7, 3, 4, 5, 2, 6)

Step 2:
Identifying chordal cycles:
- Cycle 1 has chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 2 has chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 3 has chord (3, 7)
- Cycle 5 has chord (2, 5)
- Cycle 6 has chord (0, 7)
- Cycle 7 has chord (5, 4)
- Cycle 9 has chord (2, 5)
- Cycle 10 has chord (2, 5)
- Cycle 11 has chord (0, 7)
- Cycle 13 has chord (7, 4)
- Cycle 15 has chord (4, 5)

Step 3:
Counting chordless cycles: 
There are 16 cycles in total, and 5 of them have chords. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is 16 - 5 = 11.

Final answer: [11]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, (1, 2), 3, 2)>
<2, (3, 9), 4, 9)>
<3, (3, 7), 4, 7)>
<4, 2, 5, 8, (2, 5)>
<5, 0, (0, 7), 3, 1)>
