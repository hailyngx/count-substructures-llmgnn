Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 0 - 10 - 5 - 1 - 7 - 14 - 3 - 11 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 2: 5 - 2 - 16 - 8 - 17 - 12 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 3: 10 - 15 - 3 - 14 - 7 - 8 - 16 - 2
- Cycle 4: 11 - 3 - 17 - 8 - 16 - 4 - 19 - 9
- Cycle 5: 14 - 13 - 2 - 5 - 1 - 7 - 8 - 16
- Cycle 6: 2 - 13 - 18 - 9 - 4 - 16 - 8 - 17
- Cycle 7: 4 - 6 - 11 - 17 - 12 - 7 - 14 - 0
- Cycle 8: 8 - 19 - 4 - 9 - 18 - 13 - 14 - 0
- Cycle 9: 19 - 8 - 17 - 11 - 3 - 14 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 10: 9 - 18 - 13 - 14 - 3 - 11 - 17 - 12

Step 2:
The chords in the cycles are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7>
- Cycle 2: <17, 2>
- Cycle 3: <15, 16>
- Cycle 4: <3, 9>
- Cycle 5: <2, 7>
- Cycle 6: <13, 8>
- Cycle 7: <6, 0>
- Cycle 8: <4, 13>
- Cycle 9: <8, 1>
- Cycle 10: <14, 17>

Step 3:
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final count is [0].
