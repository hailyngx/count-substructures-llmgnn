Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 9, 15>
2. <0, 1, 16, 9>
3. <0, 14, 10, 17>
4. <0, 14, 19, 16>
5. <1, 9, 15, 12>
6. <1, 16, 4, 13>
7. <2, 6, 13, 4>
8. <2, 6, 11, 17>
9. <2, 11, 17, 12>
10. <3, 13, 7, 10>
11. <3, 18, 17, 12>
12. <4, 13, 7, 10>
13. <4, 13, 3, 18>
14. <5, 8, 12, 17>
15. <5, 14, 10, 17>
16. <5, 14, 19, 16>
17. <6, 11, 17, 12>
18. <6, 13, 7, 10>
19. <7, 10, 17, 12>
20. <8, 12, 17, 10>
21. <13, 6, 2, 18>
22. <13, 6, 11, 17>
23. <13, 7, 10, 14>
24. <14, 5, 8, 12>
25. <14, 10, 17, 11>
26. <14, 19, 16, 4>
27. <15, 9, 1, 0>
28. <16, 1, 9, 15>
29. <16, 1, 0, 14>
30. <17, 10, 14, 19>
31. <17, 11, 6, 13>
32. <17, 11, 18, 3>
33. <18, 3, 13, 4>
34. <18, 3, 13, 7>
35. <18, 17, 12, 15>
36. <19, 14, 10, 17>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <2, 6, 11, 17, (18, 3)>
2. <3, 13, 7, 10, (14, 19)>
3. <5, 8, 12, 17, (10, 14)>
4. <13, 6, 2, 18, (11, 17)>
5. <17, 11, 6, 13, (4, 18)>

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the count is [5].
