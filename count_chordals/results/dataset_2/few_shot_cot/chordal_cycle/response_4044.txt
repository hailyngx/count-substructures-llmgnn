Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph. However, we are interested in chordal cycles. Let's list the ones with exactly one chord:
1. <15, 10, 25, 4> (chord: edge 10-4)
2. <3, 24, 12, 0> (chord: edge 24-12)
3. <3, 24, 29, 18> (chord: edge 24-29)
4. <13, 15, 10, 25> (chord: edge 10-25)

Step 2:
From the above list, we see that all the cycles have exactly one chord each.

Step 3:
Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [4].
