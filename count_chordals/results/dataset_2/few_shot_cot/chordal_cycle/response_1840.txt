Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 16, 15, 9>
- <0, 16, 19, 2>
- <0, 13, 8, 5>
- <0, 13, 7, 17>
- <0, 5, 11, 2>
- <1, 18, 11, 5>
- <1, 18, 4, 2>
- <1, 2, 11, 5>
- <2, 11, 5, 14>
- <2, 11, 10, 5>
- <2, 11, 18, 4>
- <2, 19, 16, 15>
- <3, 12, 15, 16>
- <3, 12, 17, 6>
- <4, 3, 12, 15>
- <4, 3, 18, 7>
- <5, 11, 18, 7>
- <5, 11, 10, 5>
- <6, 17, 7, 18>
- <6, 17, 12, 3>
- <7, 18, 11, 5>
- <8, 16, 15, 12>
- <9, 15, 12, 6>
- <9, 15, 16, 0>
- <9, 17, 7, 18>
- <10, 11, 18, 7>
- <13, 8, 16, 15>
- <13, 8, 5, 14>
- <14, 5, 11, 10>
- <15, 16, 0, 13>
- <16, 15, 12, 3>
- <17, 6, 12, 3>
- <17, 6, 12, 15>
- <17, 6, 12, 9>
- <17, 9, 15, 16>
- <18, 11, 5, 14>
- <18, 11, 10, 5>
- <19, 16, 15, 9>
- <19, 14, 5, 11>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
- <0, (13, 8), 5>
- <0, (13, 7), 17>
- <1, (18, 11), 5>
- <1, (18, 4), 2>
- <2, (11, 5), 14>
- <2, (11, 10), 5>
- <2, (11, 18), 4>
- <2, (19, 16), 15>
- <5, (11, 18), 7>
- <6, (17, 7), 18>
- <9, (15, 12), 6>
- <13, (8, 16), 15>
- <13, (8, 5), 14>
- <14, (5, 11), 10>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found gives us [13].
