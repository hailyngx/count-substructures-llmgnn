Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- The cycles in the graph are as follows:
  - Cycle 1: <0, 5, 4, 7, 0>
  - Cycle 2: <0, 5, 6, 9, 7, 0>
  - Cycle 3: <0, 5, 8, 2, 7, 0>
  - Cycle 4: <0, 1, 3, 7, 0>
  - Cycle 5: <4, 5, 6, 9, 7, 4>
  - Cycle 6: <4, 7, 2, 8, 4>
  - Cycle 7: <4, 0, 1, 8, 4>
  - Cycle 8: <5, 6, 7, 3, 1, 5>
  - Cycle 9: <5, 8, 2, 6, 9, 5>
  - Cycle 10: <6, 7, 3, 1, 8, 6>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).  
- Checking each cycle for a chord:
  - Cycle 1: <0, 5, 4, 7, 0> has a chord (5, 7)
  - Cycle 2: <0, 5, 6, 9, 7, 0> has a chord (5, 9)
  - Cycle 3: <0, 5, 8, 2, 7, 0> has a chord (5, 2)
  - Cycle 4: <0, 1, 3, 7, 0> has no chords
  - Cycle 5: <4, 5, 6, 9, 7, 4> has a chord (5, 9)
  - Cycle 6: <4, 7, 2, 8, 4> has no chords
  - Cycle 7: <4, 0, 1, 8, 4> has a chord (0, 8)
  - Cycle 8: <5, 6, 7, 3, 1, 5> has a chord (6, 1)
  - Cycle 9: <5, 8, 2, 6, 9, 5> has a chord (8, 6)
  - Cycle 10: <6, 7, 3, 1, 8, 6> has a chord (7, 1)
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.  
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 5, 4, 7, 0> (Chord: (5, 7))
- <0, 5, 6, 9, 7, 0> (Chord: (5, 9))
- <0, 5, 8, 2, 7, 0> (Chord: (5, 2))
- <4, 0, 1, 8, 4> (Chord: (0, 8))
- <5, 6, 7, 3, 1, 5> (Chord: (6, 1))
- <5, 8, 2, 6, 9, 5> (Chord: (8, 6))
- <6, 7, 3, 1, 8, 6> (Chord: (7, 1))
