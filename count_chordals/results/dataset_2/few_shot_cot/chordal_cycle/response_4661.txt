Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 4-8-14-19-16-12-4 (6-cycle)
- Cycle 4-13-4 (3-cycle)
- Cycle 4-11-1-12-16-19-14-8-4 (8-cycle)
- Cycle 4-17-18-10-5-17 (5-cycle)
- Cycle 4-17-5-10-18-6-3-4 (7-cycle)
- Cycle 4-17-3-9-2-1-0-8-4 (8-cycle)
- Cycle 4-17-3-6-15-16-12-1-11-4 (9-cycle)
- Cycle 4-12-1-0-9-3-6-15-17-18-10-19-14-8-4 (15-cycle)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 16, 5, 18>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [7]
