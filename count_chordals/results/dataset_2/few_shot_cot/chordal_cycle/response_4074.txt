Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle: 0 - 5 - 2 - 1 - 0
2. Cycle: 0 - 5 - 2 - 3 - 0
3. Cycle: 0 - 5 - 2 - 8 - 0
4. Cycle: 0 - 5 - 8 - 4 - 0
5. Cycle: 1 - 2 - 5 - 0 - 1
6. Cycle: 1 - 2 - 3 - 0 - 1
7. Cycle: 2 - 9 - 4 - 8 - 2
8. Cycle: 3 - 7 - 6 - 3
9. Cycle: 4 - 9 - 8 - 4

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. Cycle: <0, 5, 2, 1> (0 - 5 - 2 - 1) with chord (0, 1)
2. Cycle: <0, 5, 2, 3> (0 - 5 - 2 - 3) with chord (0, 3)
3. Cycle: <0, 5, 2, 8> (0 - 5 - 2 - 8) with chord (0, 8)
4. Cycle: <0, 5, 8, 4> (0 - 5 - 8 - 4) with chord (0, 4)
5. Cycle: <1, 2, 5, 0> (1 - 2 - 5 - 0) with chord (1, 0)
6. Cycle: <1, 2, 3, 0> (1 - 2 - 3 - 0) with chord (1, 0)
7. Cycle: <2, 9, 4, 8> (2 - 9 - 4 - 8) with chord (2, 4)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [7].
