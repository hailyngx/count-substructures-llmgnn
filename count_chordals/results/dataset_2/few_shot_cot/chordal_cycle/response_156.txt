Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 5) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- <0, 1, 3, 4, 5>
- <0, 1, 3, 9, 6>
- <0, 1, 8, 6, 5>
- <0, 5, 4, 7, 9>
- <1, 0, 5, 4, 7>
- <1, 3, 4, 7, 9>
- <1, 3, 9, 7, 4>
- <1, 8, 6, 9, 4>
- <2, 4, 7, 9, 3>
- <2, 4, 7, 9, 8>
- <2, 4, 5, 6, 9>
- <2, 4, 5, 8, 1>
- <2, 7, 4, 5, 8>
- <2, 7, 9, 6, 5>
- <2, 9, 6, 5, 4>
- <2, 9, 8, 1, 0>
- <2, 5, 8, 1, 0>
- <3, 4, 5, 6, 9>
- <4, 5, 6, 9, 8>
- <7, 4, 5, 6, 9>

Step 2: 
After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 3, 4, 5, (1, 9)>
- <0, 5, 4, 7, (1, 9)>
- <1, 3, 4, 7, (9, 2)>
- <1, 8, 6, 9, (4, 5)>
- <2, 4, 7, 9, (3, 8)>
- <2, 4, 5, 6, (9, 8)>
- <2, 7, 9, 6, (4, 5)>

Step 3: 
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
