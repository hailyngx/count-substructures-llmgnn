Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- (6, 9, 8, 15) is a cycle of length 4
- (6, 9, 14, 10) is a cycle of length 4
- (6, 9, 13, 28) is a cycle of length 4
- (6, 14, 23, 5) is a cycle of length 4
- (6, 14, 10, 17) is a cycle of length 4
- (6, 14, 23, 29) is a cycle of length 4
- (6, 24, 27, 22) is a cycle of length 4
- (9, 8, 15, 12) is a cycle of length 4
- (9, 14, 23, 29) is a cycle of length 4
- (9, 13, 28, 19) is a cycle of length 4
- (13, 28, 19, 11) is a cycle of length 4
- (14, 23, 29, 22) is a cycle of length 4
- (18, 25, 21, 24) is a cycle of length 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <6, 9, 8, 15> has exactly one chord (6, 15)
- (6, 9, 14, 10) - No chords
- (6, 9, 13, 28) - No chords
- (6, 14, 23, 5) - No chords
- <6, 14, 10, 17> has exactly one chord (14, 17)
- <6, 14, 23, 29> has exactly one chord (14, 29)
- <6, 24, 27, 22> has exactly one chord (24, 22)
- <9, 8, 15, 12> has exactly one chord (9, 15)
- <9, 14, 23, 29> has exactly one chord (14, 23)
- (9, 13, 28, 19) - No chords
- (13, 28, 19, 11) - No chords
- (14, 23, 29, 22) - No chords
- <18, 25, 21, 24> has exactly one chord (18, 21)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 7 chordless cycles found, therefore the final number is [7].
