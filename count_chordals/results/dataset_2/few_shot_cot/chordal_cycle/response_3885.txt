Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 7, 14, 17, 1, 5, 13, 12>
2. <0, 7, 14, 17, 19, 15, 1, 5>
3. <0, 7, 12, 13, 11, 3, 8, 4>
4. <0, 19, 17, 14, 7, 12, 13, 5>
5. <1, 17, 14, 7, 12, 13, 5, 4>
6. <5, 13, 1, 17, 14, 7, 12, 18>
7. <8, 3, 11, 13, 5, 1, 15, 19>
8. <8, 4, 5, 13, 12, 7, 14, 2>
9. <12, 7, 14, 17, 19, 0, 10, 9>
10. <13, 11, 6, 11, 3, 8, 18, 0>
11. <13, 1, 15, 19, 17, 14, 2, 12>
12. <15, 16, 3, 11, 13, 12, 18, 0>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 7, 12, 13> with chord (12, 18)
<5, 13, 1, 17> with chord (1, 14)
<13, 11, 3, 8> with chord (11, 6)
<8, 4, 5, 13> with chord (4, 8)
<15, 16, 3, 11> with chord (16, 15)

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
