Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 9 - 4 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 9 - 4 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 9 - 8 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 7 - 4 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 5: (Additional cycle: 0 - 7 - 6 - 8 - 0)

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1 with chord (4, 2)
- Cycle 2 with chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 3 with chord (8, 3)

Step 3:
Therefore, there are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. Hence, the answer is [3].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, 9, 4, 2> (Chord: (4, 2))
2. <0, 9, 4, 7> (Chord: (4, 7))
3. <0, 9, 8, 3> (Chord: (8, 3))
