Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 6, 0> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 1, 2, 0> 
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 8, 5, 0> 
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 6, 2, 1> 
- Cycle 5: <3, 9, 7, 8, 3> 
- Cycle 6: <3, 9, 6, 5, 3> 
- Cycle 7: <3, 4, 8, 2, 3> 
- Cycle 8: <4, 8, 7, 3, 4> 
- Cycle 9: <5, 1, 9, 7, 5> 
- Cycle 10: <6, 9, 7, 8, 6> 

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Unique chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 5, 6, 0> with chord (5, 6) 
- Unique chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, 9, 6, 5, 3> with chord (6, 9) 

Step 3:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [2].
