Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 3, 5, 1, 0>
- <0, 3, 9, 4, 0>
- <0, 1, 4, 9, 0>
- <1, 4, 9, 8, 1>
- <1, 4, 7, 5, 1>
- <3, 7, 4, 9, 3>
- <5, 4, 7, 1, 5>
- <5, 7, 4, 9, 5>
- <6, 4, 9, 8, 6>
- <7, 4, 9, 8, 7>

Step 2: 
- <0, 3, 5, 1, 0> has no chords.
- <0, 3, 9, 4, 0> has a chord: (3, 4).
- <0, 1, 4, 9, 0> has a chord: (1, 9).
- <1, 4, 9, 8, 1> has a chord: (4, 8).
- <1, 4, 7, 5, 1> has a chord: (4, 5).
- <3, 7, 4, 9, 3> has a chord: (7, 9).
- <5, 4, 7, 1, 5> has a chord: (4, 7).
- <5, 7, 4, 9, 5> has a chord: (7, 9).
- <6, 4, 9, 8, 6> has a chord: (4, 8).
- <7, 4, 9, 8, 7> has a chord: (4, 8).

Step 3:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
So, the final count is [10].
