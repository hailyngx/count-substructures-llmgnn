Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more are:
1. <0, 4, 3, 5, 0>
2. <0, 4, 1, 5, 0>
3. <0, 4, 1, 7, 0>
4. <0, 4, 3, 7, 0>
5. <1, 5, 9, 7, 1>
6. <1, 5, 9, 6, 1>
7. <1, 5, 3, 7, 1>
8. <3, 5, 9, 6, 3>
9. <3, 5, 9, 7, 3>
10. <3, 5, 6, 8, 3>
11. <3, 4, 8, 6, 3>
12. <3, 4, 1, 7, 3>
13. <4, 8, 6, 0, 4>
14. <4, 8, 3, 5, 4>
15. <4, 1, 5, 9, 4>
16. <4, 1, 7, 9, 4>
17. <5, 9, 6, 3, 5>
18. <6, 9, 7, 1, 6>
19. <6, 9, 5, 3, 6>
20. <7, 9, 5, 3, 7>
21. <8, 6, 9, 7, 8>
22. <8, 6, 5, 3, 8>
23. <8, 3, 5, 4, 8>
24. <8, 0, 6, 9, 8>

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord:
<0, 4, 1, 5, 0>
<0, 4, 3, 7, 0>
<1, 5, 9, 7, 1>
<3, 4, 1, 7, 3>

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
