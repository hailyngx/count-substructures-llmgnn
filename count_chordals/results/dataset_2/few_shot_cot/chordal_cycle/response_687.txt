Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 1, 5, 14>
- <0, 12, 17, 15>
- <1, 15, 17, 13>
- <2, 7, 13, 18>
- <4, 6, 7, 10>
- <4, 6, 10, 16>
- <5, 10, 14, 2>
- <5, 10, 16, 9>
- <6, 7, 13, 18>
- <9, 16, 10, 5>
- <9, 19, 3, 15>

Step 2: Identify which cycles have exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 5, 14> - Chord: (1, 5)
- <0, 12, 17, 15> - Chord: (12, 17)
- <1, 15, 17, 13> - Chord: (15, 13)
- <4, 6, 7, 10> - Chord: (6, 7)
- <4, 6, 10, 16> - Chord: (6, 10)
- <5, 10, 14, 2> - Chord: (10, 14)
- <5, 10, 16, 9> - Chord: (10, 16)
- <6, 7, 13, 18> - Chord: (7, 13)
- <9, 16, 10, 5> - Chord: (16, 10)
- <9, 19, 3, 15> - Chord: (19, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
