Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <1, 5, 10, 11>, where the chord is (1, 10).

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1 -> 5 -> 10 -> 11 -> 1

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 10)

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles: [0]
