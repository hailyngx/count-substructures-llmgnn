Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:

<0, 9, 2, 4, 1>
<0, 9, 2, 5, 1>
<0, 9, 7, 5, 1>
<0, 9, 7, 3, 1>
<0, 9, 1, 4, 2>
<2, 4, 1, 7, 3>
<2, 4, 1, 5, 7>
<2, 4, 1, 3, 9>
<2, 5, 1, 7, 3>
<2, 5, 1, 9, 3>
<2, 5, 1, 4, 2>
<3, 1, 5, 7, 9>
<3, 1, 5, 8, 6>
<3, 1, 7, 5, 8>
<3, 1, 9, 7, 5>
<3, 7, 5, 8, 6>
<5, 7, 3, 8, 6>
<5, 7, 1, 4, 2>
<5, 7, 1, 3, 9>
<5, 8, 6, 0, 9>
<7, 3, 1, 4, 2>
<7, 3, 1, 5, 8>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
<2, 4, (1, 7), 3>
<2, 5, (1, 3), 9>
<3, 1, (5, 7), 9>
<3, 1, (5, 8), 6>

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [4].
