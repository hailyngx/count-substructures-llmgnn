Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
1. Cycle 1: <0, 5, 9, 7, 2, 0>
2. Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 7, 0>
3. Cycle 3: <0, 5, 9, 7, 2, 8, 6, 1, 0>
4. Cycle 4: <0, 5, 9, 7, 2, 8, 6, 1, 3, 0>
5. Cycle 5: <0, 5, 9, 7, 2, 8, 6, 3, 0>
6. Cycle 6: <0, 5, 9, 7, 2, 8, 6, 3, 1, 0>
7. Cycle 7: <0, 5, 9, 6, 1, 4, 0>
8. Cycle 8: <0, 5, 9, 6, 1, 3, 0>
9. Cycle 9: <0, 5, 9, 6, 3, 0>
10. Cycle 10: <0, 5, 9, 6, 3, 1, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 2 has no chord
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has no chord
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has no chord
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 8 has no chord
- Cycle 9 has no chord
- Cycle 10 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found
There are 7 chordless 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [7].
