Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (3, 16, 5, 13)
- Cycle 2: (3, 16, 11, 4)
- Cycle 3: (3, 1, 9, 8)
- Cycle 4: (3, 14, 2, 6)
- Cycle 5: (0, 18, 12, 4)
- Cycle 6: (0, 18, 4, 11)
- Cycle 7: (0, 17, 8, 19)
- Cycle 8: (0, 17, 8, 9)
- Cycle 9: (0, 15, 16, 5)
- Cycle 10: (14, 3, 1, 9)
- Cycle 11: (14, 3, 16, 5)
- Cycle 12: (14, 3, 0, 18)
- Cycle 13: (14, 2, 6, 0)
- Cycle 14: (14, 8, 9, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (16, 5)
- Cycle 2 has chord (16, 11)
- Cycle 3 has chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 4 has chord (3, 14)
- Cycle 5 has chord (0, 12)
- Cycle 6 has chord (0, 4)
- Cycle 7 has chord (8, 19)
- Cycle 8 has chord (0, 8)
- Cycle 9 has chord (0, 16)
- Cycle 10 has chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 11 has chord (3, 5)
- Cycle 12 has chord (3, 18)
- Cycle 13 has chord (2, 6)
- Cycle 14 has chord (9, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 14 chordal 4-cycles in total, so the count is [14].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<3, 16, 5, 13>
<3, 16, 11, 4>
<3, 1, 9, 8>
<3, 14, 2, 6>
<0, 18, 12, 4>
<0, 18, 4, 11>
<0, 17, 8, 19>
<0, 17, 8, 9>
<0, 15, 16, 5>
<14, 3, 1, 9>
<14, 3, 16, 5>
<14, 3, 0, 18>
<14, 2, 6, 0>
<14, 8, 9, 19>
