Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 4, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 4, 9, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 6, 7, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 3, 4, 9, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 3, 7, 9, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 8, 4, 5, 0>
- Cycle 8: <0, 8, 6, 7, 0>
- Cycle 9: <0, 1, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle 10: <1, 5, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle 11: <1, 6, 7, 8, 1>
- Cycle 12: <1, 0, 3, 4, 1>
- Cycle 13: <2, 9, 4, 5, 2>
- Cycle 14: <3, 4, 5, 6, 3>
- Cycle 15: <3, 4, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle 16: <3, 7, 6, 5, 3>
- Cycle 17: <4, 5, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 18: <4, 5, 9, 2, 4>
- Cycle 19: <4, 8, 7, 6, 4>
- Cycle 20: <5, 6, 7, 8, 5>
- Cycle 21: <6, 7, 9, 4, 6>
- Cycle 22: <7, 9, 3, 0, 7>
- Cycle 23: <8, 4, 9, 7, 8>
- Cycle 24: <9, 4, 5, 6, 9>

Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycle: 
<0, 5, 4, 9, 0>, chord: (4, 9)

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found. Therefore, the final count is [1].
