- <7, 3, 19, 2> has a chord (3, 19)
- <8, 29, 13, 25> has a chord (29, 13)
- <9, 17, 22, 27> has a chord (17, 27)
- <10, 15, 23, 6> has a chord (15, 6)
- <11, 20, 25, 27> has a chord (20, 27)
- <12, 18, 21, 25> has a chord (18, 21)

- <15, 20, 11, 7> has a chord (20, 11)
- <16, 10, 9, 22> has a chord (10, 22)
- <17, 22, 27, 25> has a chord (22, 25)
- <18, 21, 28, 12> has a chord (21, 12)
- <19, 3, 23, 6> has a chord (3, 23)
- <20, 25, 27, 22> has a chord (25, 27)
- <21, 25, 13, 29> has a chord (25, 29)
- <22, 9, 17, 24> has a chord (9, 17)
- <23, 15, 8, 29> has a chord (15, 8)
- <24, 17, 22, 9> has a chord (17, 22)
- <25, 20, 11, 8> has a chord (20, 11)
- <26, 21, 18, 12> has a chord (21, 18)
- <27, 22, 17, 9> has a chord (22, 17)
- <28, 21, 26, 12> has a chord (21, 26)
- <29, 8, 11, 7> has a chord (8, 11)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There are 27 unique chordal 4-cycles found. 
Putting the final number inside brackets gives us [27].
