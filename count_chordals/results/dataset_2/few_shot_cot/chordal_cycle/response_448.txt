Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 2, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Identify all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 8, 4, 5, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 7, 0, 6, 2)
- Cycle 4: (3, 1, 8, 9, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 7, 5, 6, 3)
- Cycle 6: (4, 8, 1, 5, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 9, 0, 6, 4)
- Cycle 8: (5, 7, 2, 6, 5)
- Cycle 9: (7, 0, 6, 5, 7)
- Cycle 10: (8, 1, 3, 9, 8)
- Cycle 11: (8, 4, 5, 6, 8)
- Cycle 12: (9, 4, 8, 0, 9)
- Cycle 13: (9, 7, 2, 6, 9)

Step 2: 
Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 8, (4, 5), 1>
- <3, 1, (8, 9), 3>
- <7, 0, (2, 6), 7>
- <8, 1, (4, 5), 8>
- <9, 4, (8, 0), 9>

Step 3:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [5].
