Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 15, 27, 20> with edges (0, 15), (15, 27), (27, 20), (20, 0)
- Cycle <0, 15, 18, 20> with edges (0, 15), (15, 18), (18, 20), (20, 0)
- Cycle <1, 6, 19, 29> with edges (1, 6), (6, 19), (19, 29), (29, 1)
- Cycle <1, 2, 25, 14> with edges (1, 2), (2, 25), (25, 14), (14, 1)
- Cycle <2, 3, 8, 12> with edges (2, 3), (3, 8), (8, 12), (12, 2)
- Cycle <2, 3, 7, 13> with edges (2, 3), (3, 7), (7, 13), (13, 2)
- Cycle <3, 7, 24, 0> with edges (3, 7), (7, 24), (24, 0), (0, 3)
- Cycle <4, 1, 6, 29> with edges (4, 1), (1, 6), (6, 29), (29, 4)
- Cycle <8, 23, 9, 20> with edges (8, 23), (23, 9), (9, 20), (20, 8)
- Cycle <14, 8, 23, 3> with edges (14, 8), (8, 23), (23, 3), (3, 14)
- Cycle <21, 9, 23, 8> with edges (21, 9), (9, 23), (23, 8), (8, 21)
- Cycle <22, 21, 27, 15> with edges (22, 21), (21, 27), (27, 15), (15, 22)
- Cycle <25, 2, 3, 4> with edges (25, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 25)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only cycle <1, 6, 19, 29> has exactly one chord (1, 29) where node 6 and node 19 are non-adjacent in the cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are no chordless cycles found, so the final count is [0].
