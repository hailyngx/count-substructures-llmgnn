Response:
Let's follow the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <6, 9, 3, 5>
- Cycle 2: <6, 9, 3, 11>
- Cycle 3: <6, 9, 0, 13>
- Cycle 4: <6, 9, 2, 4>
- Cycle 5: <6, 9, 2, 7>
- Cycle 6: <6, 9, 10, 7>
- Cycle 7: <6, 9, 10, 1>
- Cycle 8: <6, 5, 3, 11>
- Cycle 9: <6, 5, 11, 7>
- Cycle 10: <6, 5, 12, 8>
- Cycle 11: <6, 5, 12, 14>
- Cycle 12: <6, 11, 7, 14>
- Cycle 13: <6, 11, 3, 9>
- Cycle 14: <6, 11, 5, 3>
- Cycle 15: <6, 11, 7, 2>
- Cycle 16: <6, 14, 12, 8>
- Cycle 17: <6, 14, 12, 0>
- Cycle 18: <6, 14, 4, 8>
- Cycle 19: <6, 14, 4, 2>
- Cycle 20: <9, 6, 5, 3>
- Cycle 21: <9, 6, 11, 3>
- Cycle 22: <9, 6, 14, 4>
- Cycle 23: <9, 6, 14, 12>
- Cycle 24: <9, 2, 4, 8>
- Cycle 25: <9, 2, 4, 14>
- Cycle 26: <9, 2, 7, 11>
- Cycle 27: <9, 2, 7, 10>
- Cycle 28: <9, 2, 7, 1>
- Cycle 29: <9, 2, 10, 8>
- Cycle 30: <9, 2, 10, 7>
- ...

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Among all the cycles listed, there are 8 chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Counting the unique chordal 4-cycles gives us a total of [8].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <6, 9, 3, 5>
2. <6, 9, 2, 4>
3. <6, 11, 5, 3>
4. <6, 11, 7, 2>
5. <6, 14, 12, 8>
6. <9, 2, 7, 1>
7. <9, 10, 7, 1>
8. <2, 10, 1, 7>
