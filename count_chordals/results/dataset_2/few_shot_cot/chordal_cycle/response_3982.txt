Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle: (0, 4, 17, 5, 0)
- Cycle: (0, 1, 9, 2, 0)
- Cycle: (0, 13, 3, 6, 0)
- Cycle: (0, 14, 8, 4, 0)
- Cycle: (1, 9, 2, 3, 1)
- Cycle: (1, 19, 7, 12, 5, 17, 11, 2, 9, 1)
- Cycle: (2, 3, 13, 7, 12, 16, 15, 14, 8, 18, 2)
- Cycle: (4, 8, 14, 15, 16, 12, 7, 13, 0, 4)
- Cycle: (5, 12, 7, 19, 6, 10, 17, 11, 14, 15, 5)
- Cycle: (6, 3, 13, 7, 19, 1, 0, 6)
- Cycle: (6, 10, 17, 4, 8, 14, 11, 2, 3, 6)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (1, 9), 2>
Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (19, 7), 12>
Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (3, 13), 7>
Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (8, 14), 0>
Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (12, 7), 17>
Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (10, 17), 4>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [6]
