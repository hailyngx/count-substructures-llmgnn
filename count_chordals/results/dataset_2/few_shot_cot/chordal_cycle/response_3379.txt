Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord: 
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <13, 22, 28, 21>, chord: (22, 28)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <13, 22, 16, 9>, chord: (22, 16)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <13, 22, 20, 26>, chord: (22, 26)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <13, 22, 28, 23>, chord: (22, 28)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <13, 27, 1, 8>, chord: (1, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <13, 27, 5, 27>, chord: (13, 27)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <22, 16, 9, 23>, chord: (16, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <22, 28, 23, 11>, chord: (28, 23)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <17, 6, 4, 23>, chord: (6, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <24, 19, 12, 13>, chord: (19, 12)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
