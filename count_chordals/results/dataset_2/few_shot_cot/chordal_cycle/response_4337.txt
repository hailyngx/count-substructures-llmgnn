- (4, 6, 14, 7, 4)
- (5, 14, 9, 4, 5)
- (8, 13, 3, 7, 8)
- (8, 13, 1, 2, 8)
- (8, 13, 2, 4, 8)
- (8, 13, 1, 4, 8)
- (8, 13, 2, 1, 8)
- (8, 2, 5, 14, 8)
- (8, 2, 1, 13, 8)
- (8, 2, 4, 6, 8)
- (8, 7, 14, 5, 8)
- (0, 12, 9, 14, 0)

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles found:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (2, 1), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (5, 14), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (12, 1), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (8, 12), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (8, 12), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (4, 6), 13>

Step 3:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [6].
