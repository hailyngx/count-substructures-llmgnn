Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 9, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 2, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 1, 8, 0, 2>
- Cycle 6: <3, 9, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle 7: <3, 6, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle 8: <4, 9, 8, 1, 4>
- Cycle 9: <5, 6, 0, 2, 5>
- Cycle 10: <6, 4, 7, 1, 6>
- Cycle 11: <6, 0, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 12: <6, 7, 9, 3, 6>
- Cycle 13: <7, 9, 8, 1, 7>
- Cycle 14: <8, 9, 4, 0, 8>
- Cycle 15: <9, 8, 1, 2, 9>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (0, 8)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (2, 7)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (6, 4)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (1, 0)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (3, 4)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (9, 1)
- Cycle 9 has no chord
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (7, 1)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (8, 4)
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 14 has a chord: (4, 0)
- Cycle 15 has a chord: (9, 1)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 4, 9, 8>
These are the only chordless 4-cycles found in the graph.
