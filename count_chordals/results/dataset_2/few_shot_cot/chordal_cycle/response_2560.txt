Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 12) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 5) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 11) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 15) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 15) (1, 17) (1, 19) (1, 7) (17, 1) (17, 19) (17, 18) (3, 5) (3, 18) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 5) (0, 11) (0, 16) (0, 19) (16, 9) (16, 0) (16, 10) (12, 6) (12, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (15, 4) (15, 2) (19, 1) (19, 17) (19, 0) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 14) (14, 6) (14, 12) (14, 5) (10, 16) (10, 18) (18, 6) (18, 17) (18, 3) (18, 10)

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph. We list them below:
1. Cycle: (2, 6, 14, 12) - Has 1 chord (2, 14)
2. Cycle: (4, 9, 16, 0) - Has 1 chord (4, 16)

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <2, 14, 6, 12> with chord (2, 14).

Step 3:
There is 1 chordless cycle found, so the final count is [1].
