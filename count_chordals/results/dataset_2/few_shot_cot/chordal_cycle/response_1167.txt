Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
- No chordal 4-cycles can be found as there are no 4-cycles in the graph.

Step 3:
- Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
