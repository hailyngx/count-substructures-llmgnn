Response:
Step 1: 
Here are the cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 27, 13, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 27, 20, 7, 25, 6, 3, 22, 21, 4, 29, 2, 9, 20, 27, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 14, 27, 13, 18, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 14, 27, 20, 28, 19, 23, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 23, 19, 8, 13, 27, 14, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 23, 19, 28, 10, 15, 29, 4, 21, 22, 3, 6, 25, 7, 20, 27, 0, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 23, 19, 28, 21, 22, 3, 6, 25, 24, 26, 22, 7, 20, 27, 14, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 23, 19, 28, 21, 4, 29, 15, 10, 8, 13, 27, 20, 7, 22, 3, 6, 25, 24, 26, 22, 3, 20, 9, 2, 16, 11, 27, 14, 1>
- Cycle 9: <2, 9, 20, 7, 25, 24, 26, 22, 21, 4, 29, 15, 10, 8, 13, 27, 20, 9, 2>
- Cycle 10: <3, 6, 25, 7, 20, 27, 11, 16, 5, 18, 15, 29, 2, 16, 11, 27, 14, 1, 23, 19, 28, 21, 4, 29, 15, 10, 8, 13, 27, 0, 1, 18, 17, 18, 3>
- Cycle 11: <4, 21, 22, 3, 6, 25, 7, 20, 27, 11, 16, 2, 9, 20, 28, 21>
- Cycle 12: <5, 18, 13, 8, 10, 28, 21, 22, 7, 25, 6, 3, 20, 27, 0, 1, 15, 29, 4, 21, 22, 26, 24, 1, 18>
- Cycle 13: <6, 25, 24, 26, 22, 21, 28, 19, 23, 1, 14, 27, 11, 16, 2, 9, 20, 3>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (27, 13), 8, (0, 27)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (14, 27), 13, (18, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (23, 19), 19, (8, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, (9, 20), 7, (20, 27)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, (6, 25), 7, (20, 27)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, (21, 22), 3, (4, 29)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, (18, 13), 8, (5, 16)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, (25, 24), 26, (6, 22)>

Step 3:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [8].
