Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle <0, 16, 2, 14, 0>
- Cycle <2, 14, 15, 14, 2>
- Cycle <5, 9, 8, 7, 5>
- Cycle <7, 8, 2, 16, 7>
- Cycle <12, 13, 17, 5, 12>
- Cycle <13, 17, 18, 12, 13>
- Cycle <14, 6, 12, 18, 14>
- Cycle <14, 0, 16, 2, 14>
- Cycle <18, 12, 1, 10, 18>
- Cycle <19, 13, 12, 6, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 16, 2, 14> with chord (15, 0)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 14, 15, 14> with chord (6, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 9, 8, 7> with chord (17, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, 8, 2, 16> with chord (11, 18)
- Chordal 4-cycle <12, 13, 17, 5> with chord (19, 3)
- Chordal 4-cycle <13, 17, 18, 12> with chord (4, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle <14, 6, 12, 18> with chord (1, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle <14, 0, 16, 2> with chord (3, 18)
- Chordal 4-cycle <18, 12, 1, 10> with chord (17, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle <19, 13, 12, 6> with chord (8, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found, which is 10.
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles in the given graph is [10].
