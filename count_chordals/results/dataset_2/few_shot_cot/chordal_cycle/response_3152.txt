Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 7) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <2, 7, 9, 1, 2>
- Cycle 3: <3, 4, 7, 2, 3>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 1, 6, 5>
- Cycle 5: <6, 9, 3, 4, 6>
- Cycle 6: <7, 9, 1, 7>
- Cycle 7: <8, 5, 9, 8>
- Cycle 8: <0, 6, 1, 9, 0>
- Cycle 9: <2, 6, 1, 7, 2>
- Cycle 10: <3, 6, 9, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Checking Cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 1, 0> - No chord
- Checking Cycle 2: <2, 7, 9, 1, 2> - Chord: (7, 9)
- Checking Cycle 3: <3, 4, 7, 2, 3> - Chord: (3, 7)
- Checking Cycle 4: <5, 9, 1, 6, 5> - Chord: (1, 6)
- Checking Cycle 5: <6, 9, 3, 4, 6> - Chord: (3, 9)
- Checking Cycle 6: <7, 9, 1, 7> - No chord
- Checking Cycle 7: <8, 5, 9, 8> - No chord
- Checking Cycle 8: <0, 6, 1, 9, 0> - No chord
- Checking Cycle 9: <2, 6, 1, 7, 2> - Chord: (1, 2)
- Checking Cycle 10: <3, 6, 9, 3> - No chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 4 chordless cycles found: Cycle 1, Cycle 6, Cycle 7, and Cycle 8.

Final result: [4]
