Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 6, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 2, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 9, 5, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 3, 9, 4, 2>
- Cycle 6: <5, 1, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 7: <6, 4, 9, 7, 6>
- Cycle 8: <8, 5, 9, 7, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: <0, (4, 6), 1, 0>
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: <0, (3, 2), 4, 0>
- Cycle 3 is chordal with 1 chord: <1, (3, 5), 9, 1>
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: <1, (6, 9), 4, 1>
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: <2, (3, 9), 4, 2>
- Cycle 6 is chordal with 1 chord: <5, (1, 9), 8, 5>
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: <6, (4, 9), 7, 6>
- Cycle 8 is chordal with 1 chord: <8, (5, 9), 7, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = 0
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [8].
