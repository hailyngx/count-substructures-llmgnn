Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph: 
<0, 5, 2, 1, 0>
<0, 5, 2, 6, 8, 5, 0>
<0, 5, 8, 6, 2, 1, 0>
<0, 4, 1, 2, 6, 3, 0>
<0, 4, 1, 2, 5, 8, 6, 3, 0>
<0, 4, 3, 6, 8, 5, 0>
<0, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0>
<0, 7, 4, 9, 5, 8, 6, 3, 0>
<1, 4, 9, 5, 2, 6, 1>
<1, 4, 9, 5, 8, 6, 2, 1>
<2, 5, 8, 6, 1, 4, 0>
<3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 9, 4>
<3, 4, 1, 6, 8, 5, 9, 7, 3>
<3, 4, 9, 5, 2, 6, 3>
<2, 5, 9, 4, 0, 7, 3, 6, 1, 2>
<3, 7, 0, 4, 9, 5, 8, 6, 2, 1, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

In cycle <0, 5, 2, 1, 0>: Chord is (5, 1)
In cycle <0, 5, 2, 6, 8, 5, 0>: Chord is (2, 8)
In cycle <0, 5, 8, 6, 2, 1, 0>: Chord is (8, 1)
In cycle <0, 4, 1, 2, 6, 3, 0>: Chord is (1, 6)
In cycle <0, 4, 1, 2, 5, 8, 6, 3, 0>: Chord is (1, 8)
In cycle <0, 4, 3, 6, 8, 5, 0>: Chord is (3, 5)
In cycle <0, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0>: Chord is (3, 1)
In cycle <0, 7, 4, 9, 5, 8, 6, 3, 0>: Chord is (7, 9)
In cycle <1, 4, 9, 5, 2, 6, 1>: Chord is (4, 2)
In cycle <1, 4, 9, 5, 8, 6, 2, 1>: Chord is (4, 2)
In cycle <2, 5, 8, 6, 1, 4, 0>: Chord is (5, 4)
In cycle <3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 9, 4>: Chord is (1, 9)
In cycle <3, 4, 1, 6, 8, 5, 9, 7, 3>: Chord is (6, 7)
In cycle <3, 4, 9, 5, 2, 6, 3>: Chord is (4, 2)
In cycle <2, 5, 9, 4, 0, 7, 3, 6, 1, 2>: Chord is (5, 7)
In cycle <3, 7, 0, 4, 9, 5, 8, 6, 2, 1, 3>: Chord is (7, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
