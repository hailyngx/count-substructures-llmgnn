Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:

<0, 18, 25, 16>
<0, 16, 24, 28>
<0, 16, 22, 19>
<0, 18, 12, 13>
<1, 17, 14, 4>
<1, 17, 14, 7>
<1, 28, 24, 16>
<1, 28, 12, 13>
<2, 27, 13, 10>
<2, 27, 13, 12>
<2, 6, 9, 10>
<2, 6, 21, 26>
<3, 5, 11, 4>
<3, 29, 10, 8>
<3, 29, 13, 12>
<4, 7, 22, 16>
<4, 7, 27, 13>
<5, 3, 23, 2>
<5, 11, 28, 1>
<6, 9, 10, 13>
<6, 21, 26, 19>
<7, 27, 2, 0>
<8, 21, 26, 19>
<8, 21, 6, 9>
<10, 13, 27, 7>
<11, 4, 14, 17>
<16, 22, 7, 4>
<21, 26, 2, 0>
<24, 28, 11, 5>
<25, 0, 16, 24>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
We can see that the cycle <0, 18, 25, 16> has exactly one chord (0, 16), the cycle <3, 5, 11, 4> has one chord (4, 11), the cycle <3, 29, 10, 8> has one chord (3, 10), and the cycle <6, 21, 26, 19> has one chord (6, 26).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
[4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 18, 25, 16>
<3, 5, 11, 4>
<3, 29, 10, 8>
<6, 21, 26, 19>
