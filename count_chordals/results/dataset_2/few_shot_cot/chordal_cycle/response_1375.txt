Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-6-3-0
- Cycle 2: 1-3-6-9-1
- Cycle 3: 1-2-4-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-8-14-13-1
- Cycle 5: 2-7-10-4-2
- Cycle 6: 3-6-14-8-3
- Cycle 7: 3-5-11-6-3
- Cycle 8: 4-10-11-5-4
- Cycle 9: 4-2-13-5-4
- Cycle 10: 4-0-9-12-4
- Cycle 11: 7-10-9-6-7
- Cycle 12: 7-2-13-9-7
- Cycle 13: 8-14-6-3-8

Step 2: 
Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (9, 6), 3, 0> with chord (9, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (6, 9), 3, 1> with chord (6, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, (10, 11), 5, 4> with chord (10, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (5, 13), 2, 4> with chord (5, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, (4, 12), 0, 4> with chord (4, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <7, (10, 9), 6, 7> with chord (10, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (7, 13), 9, 7> with chord (7, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (8, 14), 3, 8> with chord (8, 14)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are 13 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count is [8].
