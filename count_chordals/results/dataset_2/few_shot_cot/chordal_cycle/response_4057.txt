Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 10, 2, 4>
2. <0, 10, 6, 5>
3. <0, 17, 1, 8>
4. <0, 17, 4, 5>
5. <1, 17, 4, 16>
6. <1, 8, 19, 7>
7. <4, 2, 19, 7>
8. <4, 16, 18, 15>
9. <5, 6, 10, 0>
10. <9, 18, 16, 4>
11. <9, 15, 18, 16>
12. <10, 0, 17, 1>
13. <10, 0, 17, 4>
14. <10, 6, 5, 4>
15. <10, 8, 1, 17>
