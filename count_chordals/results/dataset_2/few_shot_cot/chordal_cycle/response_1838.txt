Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle with nodes 0-4-9-8-0 
- Cycle with nodes 0-4-7-5-2-0 
- Cycle with nodes 0-3-1-9-8-0 
- Cycle with nodes 0-3-1-6-5-0 
- Cycle with nodes 0-3-2-7-5-0 
- Cycle with nodes 1-9-8-5-2-1 
- Cycle with nodes 1-9-8-3-6-1 
- Cycle with nodes 2-5-6-1-9-2 
- Cycle with nodes 2-5-7-4-9-2 
- Cycle with nodes 2-5-7-0-3-2 
- Cycle with nodes 2-5-8-9-3-2 

Step 2: 
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord: 
- Cycle with nodes 0-4-7-5-2-0 has exactly one chord (7, 2) 
- Cycle with nodes 2-5-7-4-9-2 has exactly one chord (7, 9) 

Step 3: 
Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are [9] chordless cycles found. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<0, (4, 7), 5> 
<2, (5, 9), 7>
