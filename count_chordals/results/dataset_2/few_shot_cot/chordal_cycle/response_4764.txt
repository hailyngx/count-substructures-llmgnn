Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (5, 9, 6, 5)
- (5, 9, 6, 2, 5)
- (5, 9, 6, 3, 5)
- (9, 5, 6, 9)
- (9, 5, 6, 2, 9)
- (9, 5, 6, 3, 9)
- (6, 5, 9, 6)
- (6, 5, 9, 3, 6)
- (6, 5, 2, 6)
- (6, 9, 5, 6)
- (6, 9, 5, 2, 6)
- (6, 9, 5, 3, 6)
- (6, 2, 5, 6)
- (6, 2, 5, 9, 6)
- (6, 3, 5, 6)
- (6, 3, 5, 9, 6)
- (4, 0, 9, 4)
- (4, 0, 3, 4)
- (4, 1, 7, 4)
- (7, 1, 4, 7)
- (1, 4, 0, 1)
- (1, 4, 3, 1)
- (1, 7, 4, 1)
- (3, 5, 9, 3)
- (3, 9, 5, 3)
- (3, 9, 6, 3)
- (3, 9, 6, 5, 3)
- (3, 9, 6, 2, 3)
- (3, 6, 5, 3)
- (3, 6, 5, 9, 3)
- (3, 6, 2, 3)
- (3, 4, 0, 3)
- (3, 4, 1, 3)
- (3, 0, 4, 3)
- (8, 6, 5, 8)
- (8, 6, 1, 8)
- (8, 1, 4, 8)
- (8, 0, 4, 8)
- (8, 0, 3, 8)
- (0, 9, 5, 0)
- (0, 9, 6, 0)
- (0, 4, 1, 0)
- (0, 3, 5, 0)
- (0, 3, 6, 0)
- (2, 5, 9, 2)
- (2, 5, 6, 2)
- (2, 6, 5, 2)
- (2, 1, 4, 2)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 6, 5> has one chord (9, 6), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <5, 9, 6, 2, 5> has one chord (9, 2), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <5, 9, 6, 3, 5> has one chord (9, 3), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <6, 5, 9, 6> has one chord (5, 9), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <6, 5, 9, 3, 6> has one chord (5, 3), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <6, 2, 5, 6> has one chord (2)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, 9, 6, 5>
- <5, 9, 6, 2, 5>
- <5, 9, 6, 3, 5>
- <6, 5, 9, 6>
- <6, 5, 9, 3, 6>
