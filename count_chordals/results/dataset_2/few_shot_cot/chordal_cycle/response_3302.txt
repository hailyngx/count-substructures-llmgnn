Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- (1, 11, 16, 7, 1)
- (1, 11, 16, 0, 0, 6, 19, 5, 1)
- (1, 11, 16, 7, 1, 9, 2, 14, 18, 15, 11)
- (1, 11, 15, 18, 14, 2, 9, 1)
- (1, 7, 1, 9, 12, 13, 14, 18, 15, 17, 5, 19, 10, 2, 1)
- (1, 7, 16, 0, 8, 0, 6, 19, 5, 17, 15, 11, 1)

Step 2: 
Among these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <1, (2, 14), 18, 15>.

Step 3: 
As there is one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
