Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 9, 5, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 4, 7, 5, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 2, 5, 7, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 2, 4, 9, 5, 7, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 2, 9, 4, 0, 7, 1)
- Cycle 6: (2, 5, 8, 4, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 5, 7, 4, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 5, 9, 4, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 4, 7, 5, 2)
- Cycle 10: (4, 9, 2, 1, 7, 4)
- Cycle 11: (5, 9, 2, 1, 7, 5)
- Cycle 12: (9, 6, 1, 7, 5, 9)
- Cycle 13: (9, 6, 1, 2, 5, 9)
- Cycle 14: (9, 4, 7, 1, 2, 9)
- Cycle 15: (9, 4, 0, 6, 1, 9)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 4: <1, (2, 4), 5>
- Cycle 5: <1, (2, 9), 4>
- Cycle 9: <2, (5, 7), 4>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (2, 4), 5>
<1, (2, 9), 4>
<2, (5, 7), 4>
