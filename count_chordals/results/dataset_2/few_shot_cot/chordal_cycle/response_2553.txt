Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
<0, 1, 3, 4> (Chord: (1, 3))
<0, 1, 5, 7> (Chord: (1, 5))
<0, 1, 9, 7> (Chord: (1, 9))
<0, 6, 4, 7> (Chord: (4, 7))
<0, 6, 3, 4> (Chord: (3, 6))
<1, 3, 4, 7> (Chord: (1, 4))
<1, 5, 7, 14> (Chord: (5, 14))
<2, 1, 3, 4> (Chord: (1, 4))
<2, 1, 5, 7> (Chord: (1, 5))
<2, 1, 9, 7> (Chord: (1, 9))
<3, 6, 4, 7> (Chord: (4, 7))
<4, 7, 5, 14> (Chord: (5, 14))
<6, 0, 1, 5> (Chord: (0, 1))
<6, 0, 1, 9> (Chord: (0, 1))
<6, 4, 7, 5> (Chord: (4, 7))
<6, 4, 3, 1> (Chord: (3, 4))

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final count is [4].
