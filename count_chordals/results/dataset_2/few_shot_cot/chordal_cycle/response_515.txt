<17, 12, 17, 16>
<19, 4, 10, 4>
<19, 13, 5, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<0, 1, 16, 19> has one chord (1, 16)
<0, 1, 16, 15> has one chord (1, 16)
<0, 18, 0, 1> has one chord (0, 1)
<1, 16, 19, 2> has one chord (16, 19)
<5, 9, 17, 16> has one chord (9, 16)
<5, 11, 4, 19> has one chord (11, 4)
<6, 14, 11, 5> has one chord (14, 11)
<7, 1, 16, 19> has one chord (1, 16)
<11, 5, 9, 8> has one chord (5, 9)
<13, 5, 9, 8> has one chord (5, 9)
<14, 8, 9, 5> has one chord (8, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the count is [11].
