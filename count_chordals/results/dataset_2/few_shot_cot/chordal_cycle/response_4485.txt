Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <2, 18, (11, 13), 3>. 

Following the steps provided:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 2 - 18 - 4 - 9 - 2
- Cycle 2: 3 - 11 - 18 - 4 - 3
- Cycle 3: 1 - 15 - 17 - 1
- Cycle 4: 8 - 1 - 15 - 16 - 8
- Cycle 5: 7 - 3 - 11 - 18 - 7
- Cycle 6: 0 - 3 - 11 - 18 - 0
- Cycle 7: 9 - 4 - 14 - 3 - 9

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 2: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 3: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 4: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 5: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 6: Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 7: <2, 18, (11, 13), 3> is a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles found: [0]
