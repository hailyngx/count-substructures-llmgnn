Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 10, 4> with chord (5, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 9, 14, 1> with chord (9, 1)

- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, 4, 10, 2> with chord (4, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 4, 10, 8> with chord (4, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, 0, 1, 14> with chord (0, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, 0, 2, 10> with chord (0, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, 14, 1, 7> with chord (14, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <5, 14, 11, 7> with chord (14, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <9, 5, 4, 12> with chord (5, 12)

- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <9, 5, 14, 11> with chord (5, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <9, 4, 10, 2> with chord (4, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
