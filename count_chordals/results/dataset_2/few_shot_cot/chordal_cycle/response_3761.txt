Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <1, 4, 9, 5> with a single chord (1, 9).

Following the steps outlined earlier:

Step 1: List cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: <1, 4, 9, 5>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 2, 5>
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 8, 6>

Step 2: Check for chords:
- Only Cycle 1, <1, 4, 9, 5>, has a single chord (1, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
