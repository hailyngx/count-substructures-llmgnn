Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <0, 9, 8, 1, 7, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5>
2. <0, 9, 6, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 7, 8>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
1. In cycle 1, <0, 9, 8, 1, 7, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5>, there are no chords.
2. In cycle 2, <0, 9, 6, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 7, 8>, there is exactly one chord, which is edge (1, 4).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
As there is only one chordless cycle found, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, 9, 6, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 7, 8>
