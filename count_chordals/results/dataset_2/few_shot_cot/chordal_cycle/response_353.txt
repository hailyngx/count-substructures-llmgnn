Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The graph includes the following cycles of length 4 or more: 
1. <0, 2, 4, 8, 6, 0>
2. <0, 2, 3, 7, 0>
3. <1, 5, 9, 4, 1>
4. <1, 3, 7, 5, 1>
5. <2, 4, 9, 5, 2>
6. <2, 7, 3, 2>
7. <4, 8, 2, 7, 4>
8. <5, 9, 6, 5>
9. <6, 9, 5, 7, 6>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. <0, 2, 4, 8, 6, 0>: (4, 6) is a chord
2. <0, 2, 3, 7, 0>: (3, 7) is a chord
3. <1, 5, 9, 4, 1>: (5, 9) is a chord
4. <1, 3, 7, 5, 1>: (3, 7) is a chord
5. <2, 4, 9, 5, 2>: (4, 5) is a chord
6. <2, 7, 3, 2>: (3, 7) is a chord
7. <4, 8, 2, 7, 4>: (2, 7) is a chord
8. <5, 9, 6, 5>: (5, 6) is a chord
9. <6, 9, 5, 7, 6>: (5, 7) is a chord

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 2, 4, 8, 6, 0>
<0, 2, 3, 7, 0>
<1, 5, 9, 4, 1>
<2, 4, 9, 5, 2>
<2, 7, 3, 2>
<6, 9, 5, 7, 6>
