Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 1

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are: 
1. Cycle <0, 4, 1, 6, 0>
2. Cycle <0, 1, 4, 8, 0>
3. Cycle <0, 6, 5, 2, 0>
4. Cycle <2, 4, 8, 6, 2>
5. Cycle <4, 8, 6, 3, 4>
6. Cycle <5, 8, 4, 2, 5>
7. Cycle <6, 8, 5, 2, 6>
8. Cycle <6, 1, 4, 8, 6>
9. Cycle <8, 5, 6, 1, 8>
10. Cycle <8, 6, 1, 4, 8>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle <0, 4, 1, 6, 0> has one chord (4, 6)
2. Cycle <0, 1, 4, 8, 0> has one chord (1, 8)
3. Cycle <0, 6, 5, 2, 0> has one chord (5, 2)
4. Cycle <2, 4, 8, 6, 2> has one chord (4, 6)
5. Cycle <4, 8, 6, 3, 4> has one chord (8, 3)
6. Cycle <5, 8, 4, 2, 5> has one chord (8, 2)
7. Cycle <6, 8, 5, 2, 6> has one chord (8, 5)
8. Cycle <6, 1, 4, 8, 6> has one chord (1, 4)
9. Cycle <8, 5, 6, 1, 8> has one chord (5, 1)
10. Cycle <8, 6, 1, 4, 8> has one chord (6, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 4, 1, 6, 0>
<0, 1, 4, 8, 0>
<0, 6, 5, 2, 0>
<2, 4, 8, 6, 2>
<4, 8, 6, 3, 4>
<5, 8, 4, 2, 5>
<6, 8, 5, 2, 6>
<6, 1, 4, 8, 6>
<8, 5, 6, 1, 8>
<8, 6, 1, 4, 8>
