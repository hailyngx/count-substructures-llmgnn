Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle <1, 7, 3, 6, 1>
        - Cycle <1, 7, 6, 4, 1>
        - Cycle <1, 6, 4, 9, 5, 1>
        - Cycle <1, 6, 4, 9, 7, 1>
        - Cycle <1, 6, 7, 3, 6, 1>
        - Cycle <1, 6, 7, 4, 1>
        - Cycle <2, 1, 7, 3, 2>
        - Cycle <2, 1, 7, 4, 1>
        - Cycle <2, 1, 5, 9, 8, 2>
        - Cycle <2, 1, 5, 9, 7, 1>
        - Cycle <2, 1, 6, 4, 1>
        - Cycle <3, 7, 4, 9, 5, 3>
        - Cycle <3, 7, 4, 9, 8, 2, 5, 3>
        - Cycle <3, 7, 6, 4, 1, 5, 3>
        - Cycle <4, 9, 5, 2, 8, 7, 4>
        - Cycle <4, 9, 5, 2, 1, 6, 4>
        - Cycle <4, 9, 7, 3, 6, 4>
        - Cycle <5, 9, 8, 2, 1, 6, 4, 5>
        
Step 2: Checking for chordal cycles:
        - Chordal cycle <1, 6, 4, 9, 7, 1> with chord (1, 9)
        - Chordal cycle <2, 1, 7, 3, 2> with chord (1, 3)
        - Chordal cycle <3, 7, 6, 4, 1, 3> with chord (3, 1)
        - Chordal cycle <4, 9, 5, 2, 8, 7, 4> with chord (4, 8)
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph, hence, the total number of chordless 4-cycles is [15].
