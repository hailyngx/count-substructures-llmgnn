Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- Cycle 1: 1-4-14-5-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-3-10-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-3-6-5-1
- Cycle 4: 1-4-14-2-5-1
- Cycle 5: 1-7-11-6-5-1
- Cycle 6: 8-9-5-11-7-8
- Cycle 7: 2-5-14-4-1-2
- Cycle 8: 2-5-14-1-10-2
- Cycle 9: 2-5-6-13-9-2
- Cycle 10: 2-5-6-11-9-2
- Cycle 11: 2-5-6-11-7-2
- Cycle 12: 2-9-13-6-11-2
- Cycle 13: 2-9-13-6-5-2
- Cycle 14: 3-4-14-5-10-3
- Cycle 15: 3-10-7-8-9-3
- Cycle 16: 3-10-7-11-6-3

Step 2:
Out of the above cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
<1, 3, (4, 1), 14>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [15].
