Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 11) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 1) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 10) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 2) (12, 11) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 1) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 10) (2, 12) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 2) (10, 9) (10, 6) (10, 13) (10, 1)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 0-14-7-5-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-6-1-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-4-9-0

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycle:
- <0, 1, 6, 4> (Chord: (1, 6))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
