Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 11) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 13) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 14) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 12) (2, 14) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 10) (14, 9) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 2) (13, 9) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 6) (11, 13)

Node 10 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, 6, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 2

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <5, 10, 6, 11> with non-adjacent chords (1, 13). 
Counting the number of chordless cycles in the graph results in [4].
