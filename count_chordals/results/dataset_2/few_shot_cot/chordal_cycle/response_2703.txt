Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 11, 16> with edges (0, 14), (14, 11), (11, 16), (16, 0)
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 3, 4> with edges (0, 5), (5, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)
- Cycle 3: <10, 16, 11, 14> with edges (10, 16), (16, 11), (11, 14), (14, 10)
- Cycle 4: <12, 4, 3, 18> with edges (12, 4), (4, 3), (3, 18), (18, 12)
- Cycle 5: <17, 0, 5, 2> with edges (17, 0), (0, 5), (5, 2), (2, 17)
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 12, 7> with edges (1, 4), (4, 12), (12, 7), (7, 1)
- Cycle 7: <16, 18, 3, 4> with edges (16, 18), (18, 3), (3, 4), (4, 16)
- Cycle 8: <0, 17, 10, 5> with edges (0, 17), (17, 10), (10, 5), (5, 0)

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Chordless cycle found: <0, 14, 11, 16>
- Chordless cycle found: <0, 5, 3, 4>
- Chordless cycle found: <10, 16, 11, 14>
- Chordless cycle found: <12, 4, 3, 18>
- Chordless cycle found: <17, 0, 5, 2>
- Chordless cycle found: <1, 4, 12, 7>
- Chordless cycle found: <16, 18, 3, 4>
- Chordless cycle found: <0, 17, 10, 5>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 8 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [8].
