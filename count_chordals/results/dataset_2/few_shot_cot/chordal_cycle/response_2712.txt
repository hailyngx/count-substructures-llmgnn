Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with all existing edges:
- Cycle <0, 1, 14, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle <0, 1, 14, 11, 8, 13, 6, 10, 5, 14>
- Cycle <0, 1, 14, 7, 11, 4, 12, 3, 2, 9, 5, 10, 6, 13, 8, 11>
- Cycle <0, 4, 12, 3, 2, 9, 5, 10, 6, 13, 8, 11, 7, 14>
- Cycle <0, 11, 8, 13, 6, 10, 5, 9, 2, 3, 12, 4>
- Cycle <1, 0, 4, 12, 3, 2, 9, 5, 10, 6, 13, 8, 11, 7, 14, 1>
- Cycle <1, 14, 11, 8, 13, 6, 10, 5, 9, 2, 3, 12, 4, 0, 1>
- Cycle <2, 9, 5, 4, 12, 3, 7, 11, 0, 1, 14, 5, 10>
- Cycle <3, 12, 4, 0, 1, 14, 11, 8, 13, 6, 10, 5, 9, 2>
- Cycle <4, 12, 3, 2, 9, 5, 10, 6, 13, 8, 11, 7, 14, 0>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly 1 chord:
- Chordal cycle <0, (1, 14), 11, 4, 12, 3, 2, 9, 5, 10, 6, 13, 8, (11, 7), 14, 0>
- Chordal cycle <0, (4, 12), 3, 2, 9, 5, 10, 6, 13, 8, 11, 7, (14, 1), 0>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [8] chordless 4-cycles in the graph.
