Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 5, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 5, 3>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 2>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 2, 5>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 7, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 7, 8, 9>
- Cycle 7: <3, 9, 4, 5>
- Cycle 8: <4, 7, 8, 9>
- Cycle 9: <5, 4, 9, 8>
- Cycle 10: <6, 9, 3, 5>
- Cycle 11: <6, 9, 4, 7>
- Cycle 12: <7, 4, 5, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 5, 3> has one chord 4 (0-5)
- <0, 4, 7, 2> has one chord 0 (4-7)
- <0, 7, 2, 5> has one chord 7 (0-2)
- <0, 9, 6, 5> has one chord 6 (0-9)
- <1, 4, 7, 2> has one chord 4 (1-7)
- <2, 7, 8, 9> has one chord 7 (2-8)
- <3, 9, 4, 5> has one chord 9 (3-4)
- <4, 7, 8, 9> has one chord 7 (4-8)
- <5, 4, 9, 8> has one chord 4 (5-9)
- <6, 9, 3, 5> has one chord 9 (6-3)
- <6, 9, 4, 7> has one chord 9 (6-4)
- <7, 4, 5, 2> has one chord 4 (7-5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
