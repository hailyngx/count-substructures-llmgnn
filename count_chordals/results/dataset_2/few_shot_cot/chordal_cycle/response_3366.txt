Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 4, 2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 0, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 1, 8, 2, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 8, 2, 4, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 8, 0, 9, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 8, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 7: (9, 0, 1, 5, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 3, 4, 2, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 3, 6, 5, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 3, 7, 2, 9)

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: <1, (2, 4), 5>
- Cycle 2: <1, (0, 9), 5>
- Cycle 3: <1, (8, 2), 5>
- Cycle 4: <8, (2, 4), 5>
- Cycle 5: <8, (0, 9), 5>
- Cycle 6: <8, (1, 0), 5>
- Cycle 7: <0, (1, 5), 9>
- Cycle 8: <3, (4, 2), 9>
- Cycle 9: <3, (6, 5), 9>
- Cycle 10: <3, (7, 2), 9>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles in the graph is [0].
