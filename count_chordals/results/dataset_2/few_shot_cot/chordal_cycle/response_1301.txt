Step 2: Checking for the existence of exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 9, 1, 14, 2>, Chord: (1, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 3, 13>, Chord: (3, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, 14, 8, 12, 6>, Chord: (8, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 8, 14, 11, 2>, Chord: (14, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 6, 9, 1, 10>, Chord: (9, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, 9, 10, 1, 14>, Chord: (10, 1)
  
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [21] chordless cycles in the graph.
