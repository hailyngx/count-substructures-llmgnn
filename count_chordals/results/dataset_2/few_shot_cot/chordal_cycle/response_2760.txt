Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- <5, 9, 2, 11, 5>
- <5, 13, 12, 11, 5>
- <5, 0, 13, 6, 14, 12, 11, 2, 9, 5>
- <9, 4, 12, 11, 2, 9>
- <9, 4, 7, 5, 13, 6, 14, 12, 11, 9>
- <9, 11, 14, 12, 5, 13, 6, 14, 1, 8, 9>
- <4, 7, 5, 13, 6, 14, 1, 8, 9, 4>
- <7, 5, 13, 6, 14, 12, 11, 2, 3, 10, 0, 5>
- <10, 0, 13, 5, 9, 4, 7, 5>
- <11, 9, 4, 7, 5, 13, 6, 14, 1, 8, 11>
- <6, 13, 5, 7, 4, 12, 11, 9, 3, 10, 0, 6>

- <2, 9, 5, 7, 4, 12, 11, 3, 10, 0, 2>
  
Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <9, 4, 12, 11, 2, 9> has exactly one chord (4, 11)
- <9, 4, 7, 5, 13, 6, 14, 12, 11, 9> has exactly one chord (5, 14)
- <4, 7, 5, 13, 6, 14, 1, 8, 9, 4> has exactly one chord (5, 1)
- <10, 0, 13, 5, 9, 4, 7, 5> has exactly one chord (0, 9)
- <11, 9, 4, 7, 5, 13, 6, 14, 1, 8, 11> has exactly one chord (5, 1)
- <6, 13, 5, 7, 4, 12, 11, 9, 3, 10, 0, 6> has exactly one chord (5, 9)
- <1, 8, 9, 5, 7, 4, 12, 13, 6, 14, 1> has exactly one chord (5, 14)
- <2, 9, 5, 7, 4, 12, 11, 3, 10, 0, 2> has exactly one chord (5, 11)

- <9, 4, 12, 11, 2, 9>
- <9, 4, 7, 5, 13, 6, 14, 12, 11, 9>
- <4, 7, 5, 13, 6, 14, 1, 8, 9, 4>
- <10, 0, 13, 5, 9, 4, 7, 5>
- <11, 9, 4, 7, 5, 13, 6, 14, 1, 8, 11>
- <6, 13, 5, 7, 4, 12, 11, 9, 3, 10, 0, 6>
- <1, 8, 9, 5, 7, 4, 12, 13, 6, 14, 1>
- <2, 9, 5, 7, 4, 12, 11, 3, 10, 0, 2>
