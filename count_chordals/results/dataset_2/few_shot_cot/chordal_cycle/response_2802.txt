Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 4, 1, 6>
2. <0, 4, 1, 13>
3. <0, 4, 11, 2>
4. <0, 4, 11, 14>
5. <0, 7, 4, 1>
6. <0, 7, 4, 11>
7. <0, 7, 10, 1>
8. <0, 12, 2, 11>
9. <1, 6, 3, 13>
10. <1, 6, 10, 0>
11. <1, 6, 10, 7>
12. <1, 13, 3, 6>
13. <1, 13, 10, 0>
14. <1, 13, 10, 7>
15. <2, 5, 13, 3>
16. <2, 5, 13, 11>
17. <2, 12, 0, 4>
18. <2, 12, 14, 9>
19. <2, 3, 6, 1>
20. <2, 3, 13, 11>
21. <3, 6, 1, 4>
22. <3, 6, 1, 13>
23. <3, 6, 10, 7>
24. <3, 4, 7, 14>
25. <3, 4, 11, 13>
26. <4, 7, 10, 1>
27. <4, 11, 0, 12>
28. <4, 11, 2, 5>
29. <7, 10, 6, 1>
30. <7, 14, 9, 8>
31. <11, 0, 12, 2>
32. <11, 14, 9, 8>

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 4, 1, 6> (Chord: (4, 1))
2. <0, 4, 11, 2> (Chord: (4, 11))
3. <0, 4, 11, 14> (Chord: (4, 11))
4. <0, 7, 4, 1> (Chord: (4, 1))
5. <0, 7, 4, 11> (Chord: (4, 11))
6. <0, 7, 10, 1> (Chord: (10, 1))
7. <0, 12, 2, 11> (Chord: (2, 11))
8. <1, 6, 3, 13> (Chord: (3, 13))
9. <1, 6, 10, 0> (Chord: (6, 10))
10. <1, 6, 10, 7> (Chord: (6, 10))
11. <1, 13, 3, 6> (Chord: (3, 6))
12. <1, 13, 10, 0> (Chord: (10, 0))
13. <1, 13, 10, 7> (Chord: (10, 7))
14. <2, 5, 13, 3> (Chord: (5, 3))
15. <2, 5, 13, 11> (Chord: (5, 13))
16. <2, 12, 0, 4> (Chord: (0, 4))
17. <2, 12, 14, 9> (Chord: (12, 14))
18. <2, 3, 6, 1> (Chord: (6, 1))
19. <2, 3, 13, 11> (Chord: (3, 13))
20. <3, 6, 1, 4> (Chord: (1, 4))
21. <3, 6, 1, 13> (Chord: (1, 13))
22. <3, 6, 10, 7> (Chord: (10, 7))
23. <3, 4, 7, 14> (Chord: (7, 14))
24. <3, 4, 11, 13> (Chord: (11, 13))
25. <4, 7, 10, 1> (Chord: (7, 10))
26. <4, 11, 0, 12> (Chord: (0, 12))
27. <7, 10, 6, 1> (Chord: (10, 6))
28. <7, 14, 9, 8> (Chord: (9, 8))
29. <11, 0, 12, 2> (Chord: (0, 12))
30. <11, 14, 9, 8> (Chord: (9, 8))

Step 3:
There are 30 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [30].
