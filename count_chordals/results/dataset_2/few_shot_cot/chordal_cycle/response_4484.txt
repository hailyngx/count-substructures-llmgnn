Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 

Possible cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (3, 5, 2, 9, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 1, 9, 8, 4, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 7, 6, 8, 4, 3)
- Cycle 4: (2, 5, 3, 1, 9, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 1, 3, 5, 7, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 3, 4, 8, 6, 2)

Step 2:

Out of the above cycles, only Cycle 1 has a chord - edge (2, 9).

Step 3:

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <1, (2, 5), 3, 9>
