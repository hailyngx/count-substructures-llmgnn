Step 2:
Checking for a chord in each of the identified cycles:
- <4, 0, 1, 5> (Chord: 0)
- <4, 0, 3, 1> (Chord: 0)
- <4, 0, 10, 1> (Chord: 0)
- <4, 8, 3, 0> (Chord: 3)
- <4, 9, 13, 5> (Chord: 5)
- <4, 9, 13, 10> (Chord: 13)
- <7, 4, 8, 3> (Chord: 4)
- <7, 4, 0, 3> (Chord: 3)
- <7, 4, 0, 1> (Chord: 4)
- <7, 12, 2, 5> (Chord: 12)
- <7, 12, 0, 4> (Chord: 12)
- <7, 14, 5, 13> (Chord: 14)
- <7, 14, 5, 1> (Chord: 14)
- <1, 0, 10, 13> (Chord: 0)
- <1, 0, 12, 7> (Chord: 0)

- <1, 11, 13, 10> (Chord: 11)
- <1, 11, 2, 6> (Chord: 2)
- <3, 0, 4, 8> (Chord: 0)
- <3, 0, 12, 7> (Chord: 0)
- <3, 8, 4, 9> (Chord: 4)
- <8, 4, 9, 13> (Chord: 4)
- <8, 3, 1, 5> (Chord: 3)
- <8, 0, 4, 9> (Chord: 9)
- <13, 9, 4, 0> (Chord: 9)
- <13, 9, 10, 1> (Chord: 9)
- <12, 0, 4, 9> (Chord: 0)
- <12, 0, 4, 7> (Chord: 0)
