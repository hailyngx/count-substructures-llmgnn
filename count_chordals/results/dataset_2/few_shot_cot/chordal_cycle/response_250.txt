Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Based on the given graph, the unique chordal 4-cycle is:

<0, 5, 3, 7>

Therefore, the total number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
