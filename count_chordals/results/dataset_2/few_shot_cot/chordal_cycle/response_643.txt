- Cycle 3: <3, 17, 20, 18>
- Cycle 4: <3, 17, 22, 9>
- Cycle 5: <3, 17, 20, 18>
- Cycle 6: <3, 22, 9, 24>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Chordal Cycle 1: <0, 11, 14, 4>, Chord: (11, 4)
- Chordal Cycle 2: <3, 22, 9, 24>, Chord: (22, 9)
- Chordal Cycle 3: <4, 14, 11, 0>, Chord: (14, 11)
- Chordal Cycle 4: <9, 21, 0, 11>, Chord: (21, 11)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

- Number of unique chordal 4-cycles: [4]
