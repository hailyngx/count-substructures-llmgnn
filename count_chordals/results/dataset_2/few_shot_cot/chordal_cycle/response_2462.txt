Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-6-13-5-14-7-0
- Cycle 2: 1-3-4-7-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-5-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-3-8-14-5-1
- Cycle 5: 3-4-7-9-6-10-3
- Cycle 6: 3-5-2-1-8-3
- Cycle 7: 5-13-6-10-0-7-5
- Cycle 8: 5-14-8-6-13-5
- Cycle 9: 7-14-8-6-10-7
- Cycle 10: 7-0-1-3-8-14-7
- Cycle 11: 9-6-13-5-2-9
- Cycle 12: 9-11-1-0-6-10-9
- Cycle 13: 10-6-8-14-7-0-10
- Cycle 14: 11-9-10-6-8-13-11
- Cycle 15: 12-10-6-13-5-2-12
- Cycle 16: 12-11-9-6-13-5-12

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, 3, (8, 14), 5>
- <3, 5, (2, 1), 8>
- <5, 13, (6, 10), 7>
- <7, 14, (8, 6), 10>
- <9, 11, (1, 10), 6>
- <10, 6, (8, 7), 13>
- <11, 9, (10, 6), 13>
- <12, 10, (6, 13), 5>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [8].
