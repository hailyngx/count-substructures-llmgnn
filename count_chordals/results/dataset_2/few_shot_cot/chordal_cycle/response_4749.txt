- Cycle 6: <3, 9, 4, 7>
- Cycle 7: <3, 9, 11, 6>
- Cycle 8: <12, 1, 6, 10>
- Cycle 9: <12, 1, 3, 9>

- Cycle 24: <9, 11, 12, 8>
- Cycle 25: <6, 1, 3, 13>
- Cycle 26: <6, 1, 12, 8>
- Cycle 27: <6, 10, 1, 3>
- Cycle 28: <6, 10, 13, 7>
- Cycle 29: <6, 11, 9, 4>
- Cycle 30: <2, 1, 3, 9>
- Cycle 31: <2, 1, 12, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Unique Chordal 4-Cycles:
  - <12, 8, (6, 10), 1>
  - <12, 1, (3, 9), 6>
  - <12, 1, (10, 13), 3>
  - <12, 8, (9, 11), 1>
  - <0, 4, (7, 13), 9>
  - <0, 7, (4, 9), 13>
  - <0, 12, (1, 6), 8>
  - <8, 12, (0, 4), 9>
  - <8, 9, (4, 7), 12>
  - <8, 9, (11, 12), 4>
  - <6, 1, (3, 13), 8>
  - <6, 10, (1, 3), 13>
  - <6, 11, (9, 4), 1>
  - <2, 1, (3, 9), 12>
  - <5, 8, (12, 0), 1>
  - <5, 8, (4, 9), 12>
  - <14, 9, (4, 7), 5>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Thus, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [16].
