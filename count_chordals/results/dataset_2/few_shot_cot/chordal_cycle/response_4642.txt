Response:
Step 1:  
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in this graph. We will now list them out:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 10, 4, 11>
- Cycle 2: <0, 2, 5, 3, 9>
- Cycle 3: <2, 4, 7, 13, 9>
- Cycle 4: <5, 6, 10, 12, 4>
- Cycle 5: <6, 8, 9, 3, 5>
- Cycle 6: <10, 12, 14, 13, 7>

Step 2:
We will now check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has chord <2, 13>.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has chord <10, 13>.

Step 3:  
We have found a total of [2] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <2, 4, 7, 13> with chord (2, 13)
2. <10, 12, 14, 13> with chord (10, 13)
