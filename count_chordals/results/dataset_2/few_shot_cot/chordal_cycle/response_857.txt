Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 9, 6, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 2, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 4, 9, 3, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 4, 0, 6, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- The cycle <0, 4, 8, 5, 0> has a chord: (4, 8)
- The cycle <0, 5, 2, 6, 0> has a chord: (5, 2)
- The cycle <1, 3, 6, 2, 1> has a chord: (3, 2)
- The cycle <1, 6, 7, 3, 1> has a chord: (6, 3)
- The cycle <2, 4, 9, 3, 2> has a chord: (4, 3)
- The cycle <2, 4, 0, 6, 2> has a chord: (4, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
