Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 5, 4, 9>
- <0, 5, 6, 1>
- <0, 5, 3, 1>
- <0, 2, 1, 9>
- <1, 9, 4, 7>
- <1, 9, 7, 8>
- <1, 6, 5, 4>
- <1, 6, 2, 0>
- <1, 7, 4, 5>
- <2, 6, 1, 9>
- <3, 5, 4, 7>
- <3, 5, 6, 1>
- <4, 5, 6, 1>
- <4, 5, 0, 9>
- <4, 7, 8, 1>
- <4, 7, 9, 1>
- <5, 6, 1, 7>
- <6, 5, 4, 7>
- <6, 1, 7, 9>
- <7, 9, 4, 5>
- <7, 9, 1, 6>
- <8, 7, 4, 5>
- <8, 7, 1, 6>
- <9, 4, 5, 6>
- <9, 4, 7, 1>
- <9, 1, 7, 4>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 5, 4, 9> (Chord: (5, 4))
- <0, 5, 6, 1> (Chord: (5, 6))
- <0, 5, 3, 1> (Chord: (3, 1))
- <0, 2, 1, 9> has 2 chords
- <1, 9, 4, 7> (Chord: (9, 4))
- <1, 9, 7, 8> has 2 chords
- <1, 6, 5, 4> (Chord: (5, 4))
- <1, 6, 2, 0> has 2 chords
- <1, 7, 4, 5> (Chord: (4, 5))
- <2, 6, 1, 9> has 2 chords
- <3, 5, 4, 7> (Chord: (5, 4))
- <3, 5, 6, 1> has 2 chords
- <4, 5, 6, 1> (Chord: (5, 6))
- <4, 5, 0, 9> (Chord: (5, 0))
- <4, 7, 8, 1> has 2 chords
- <4, 7, 9, 1> (Chord: (7, 1))
- <5, 6, 1, 7> (Chord: (6, 7))
- <6, 5, 4, 7> (Chord: (5, 7))
- <6, 1, 7, 9> has 2 chords
- <7, 9, 4, 5> (Chord: (9, 4))
- <7, 9, 1, 6> (Chord: (9, 6))
- <8, 7, 4, 5> (Chord: (7, 5))
- <8, 7, 1, 6> (Chord: (7, 6))
- <9, 4, 5, 6> (Chord: (4, 6))
- <9, 4, 7, 1> (Chord: (4, 1))
- <9, 1, 7, 4> has 2 chords

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [14]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 5, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 6, 1>
<0, 5, 3, 1>
<1, 9, 4, 7>
<1, 6, 5, 4>
<1, 7, 4, 5>
<3, 5, 4, 7>
<4, 5, 6, 1>
<4, 5, 0, 9>
<5, 6, 1, 7>
<6, 5, 4, 7>
<7, 9, 4, 5>
<8, 7, 4, 5>
<9, 4, 5, 6>
