Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 6 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 5 - 7 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 3: 1 - 9 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 9 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 5: 2 - 7 - 4 - 1 - 2
- Cycle 6: 2 - 7 - 3 - 1 - 2
- Cycle 7: 3 - 9 - 4 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 8: 4 - 9 - 1 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 9: 5 - 6 - 1 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 10: 6 - 5 - 7 - 4 - 6
- Cycle 11: 6 - 1 - 4 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 12: 7 - 5 - 6 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 13: 7 - 4 - 1 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 14: 8 - 6 - 5 - 0 - 8
- Cycle 15: 8 - 6 - 2 - 7 - 8
- Cycle 16: 9 - 4 - 1 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 17: 9 - 3 - 1 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 18: 9 - 1 - 6 - 5 - 9
- Cycle 19: 0 - 5 - 7 - 3 - 0

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (6, 1)
- Cycle 2 has 2 chords: (7, 5)
- Cycle 6 has 2 chords: (7, 1)
- Cycle 7 has 2 chords: (4, 1) 
- Cycle 8 is chordal: <0, (1, 6), 4>
- Cycle 10 has 2 chords: (6, 5)
- Cycle 11 is chordal: <6, (1, 4), 7>
- Cycle 12 has 2 chords: (5, 2)
- Cycle 13 is chordal: <7, (1, 6), 4>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: 
There are 3 chordless cycles: Cycle 8, Cycle 11, and Cycle 13.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
