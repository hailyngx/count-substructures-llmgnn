Response:
Step 1: 
There are many cycles of length 4 in the graph. Let's list them:
1. Cycle: <0, 9, 11, 1>
2. Cycle: <0, 9, 14, 6>
3. Cycle: <0, 2, 4, 13>
4. Cycle: <0, 2, 5, 8>
5. Cycle: <0, 7, 5, 8>
6. Cycle: <1, 6, 13, 4>
7. Cycle: <1, 6, 14, 9>
8. Cycle: <1, 5, 8, 3>
9. Cycle: <1, 12, 6, 13>
10. Cycle: <2, 0, 7, 5>
11. Cycle: <2, 4, 10, 7>
12. Cycle: <3, 8, 5, 7>
13. Cycle: <3, 8, 1, 6>
14. Cycle: <3, 12, 0, 7>
15. Cycle: <3, 12, 6, 1>
16. Cycle: <4, 10, 7, 5>
17. Cycle: <4, 10, 11, 1>
18. Cycle: <4, 13, 3, 12>
19. Cycle: <5, 2, 0, 7>
20. Cycle: <5, 2, 4, 13>
21. Cycle: <5, 7, 0, 12>
22. Cycle: <5, 8, 3, 13>
23. Cycle: <6, 1, 12, 9>
24. Cycle: <6, 13, 3, 12>
25. Cycle: <6, 14, 9, 11>
26. Cycle: <7, 0, 12, 9>
27. Cycle: <7, 5, 8, 1>
28. Cycle: <9, 11, 10, 7>
29. Cycle: <9, 11, 1, 6>
30. Cycle: <9, 12, 0, 2>
31. Cycle: <10, 4, 13, 3>
32. Cycle: <10, 7, 0, 2>
33. Cycle: <11, 9, 14, 6>
34. Cycle: <12, 0, 2, 4>
35. Cycle: <12, 3, 8, 5>
36. Cycle: <12, 6, 13, 4>
37. Cycle: <13, 4, 10, 11>
38. Cycle: <13, 6, 1, 8>
39. Cycle: <14, 6, 1, 11>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- The cycle <0, 9, 11, 1> has a chord (9, 1).
- The cycle <1, 5, 8, 3> has a chord (5, 8).
- The cycle <4, 10, 11, 1> has a chord (10, 1).
- The cycle <9, 11, 14, 6> has a chord (11, 6).
- The cycle <4, 13, 3, 12> has a chord (13, 12).
- The cycle <5, 7, 0, 12> has a chord (7, 12).
- The cycle <14, 6, 1, 11> has a chord (6, 11).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: 
The number of unique chordal 4-cycles is [33].
