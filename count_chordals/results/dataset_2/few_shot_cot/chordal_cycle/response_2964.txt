Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2: 
- There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3:
- There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
