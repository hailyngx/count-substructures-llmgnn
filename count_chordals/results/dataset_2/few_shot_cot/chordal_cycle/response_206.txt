Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 6, 15, 16, 14)
- Cycle 2: (0, 4, 6, 10, 11, 14)
- Cycle 3: (0, 4, 10, 11, 14, 16)
- Cycle 4: (0, 4, 10, 11, 18, 19)
- Cycle 5: (3, 14, 11, 18, 19, 9)
- Cycle 6: (3, 14, 11, 10, 6, 15)
- Cycle 7: (3, 14, 16, 15, 6, 10)
- Cycle 8: (3, 17, 1, 14, 11, 18)
- Cycle 9: (3, 17, 1, 14, 16, 15)
- Cycle 10: (3, 19, 18, 11, 10, 6)
- Cycle 11: (3, 19, 18, 11, 14, 16)
- Cycle 12: (4, 6, 10, 11, 18, 19)
- Cycle 13: (13, 19, 18, 11, 14, 16)
- Cycle 14: (13, 19, 18, 11, 10, 6)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 4, 6, 10> (chord: (4, 10))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 4, 10, 11> (chord: (4, 10))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 4, 10, 11> (chord: (4, 10))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 4, 10, 11> (chord: (4, 10))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <11, 14, 16, 15> (chord: (14, 15))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <11, 10, 6, 15> (chord: (10, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <14, 16, 15, 6> (chord: (15, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, 14, 11, 18> (chord: (14, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <1, 14, 16, 15> (chord: (14, 15))
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <3, 19, 18, 11> (chord: (19, 18))
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <11, 14, 16, 15> (chord: (14, 15))
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <11, 10, 6, 15> (chord: (10, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <19, 18, 11, 14> (chord: (18, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <19, 18, 11, 10> (chord: (18, 11))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are a total of 14 chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the count is [14].
