Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
1. <0, 7, 2, 3, 5, 9, 1, 6>
2. <0, 7, 2, 11, 10, 6, 1, 9>
3. <0, 1, 12, 2, 13, 4, 9, 5>
4. <0, 7, 13, 2, 12, 9, 5, 3>
5. <0, 7, 13, 2, 3, 5, 9, 12>
6. <1, 9, 12, 14, 13, 7, 3, 5>
7. <2, 11, 10, 6, 14, 8, 3, 7>
8. <2, 13, 14, 12, 1, 6, 10, 5>
9. <3, 5, 9, 1, 12, 14, 6, 10>
10. <4, 9, 5, 3, 7, 13, 14, 12>
11. <4, 13, 2, 11, 10, 6, 1, 12>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, 7, 2, 3, (5, 9), 1, 6>
2. <0, 7, 2, 11, (10, 6), 1, 9>
3. <0, 1, 12, (2, 13), 4, 9, 5>
4. <0, 7, (13, 2), 12, 9, 5, 3>
5. <0, 7, 13, (2, 12), 9, 5, 3>
6. <1, 9, (12, 14), 13, 7, 3, 5>
7. <2, 11, (10, 6), 14, 8, 3, 7>
8. <2, (13, 14), 12, 1, 6, 10, 5>
9. <3, 5, 9, 1, (12, 14), 6, 10>
10. <4, 9, 5, 3, 7, 13, 14, 12>
11. <4, 13, 2, 11, (10, 6), 1, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 11 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.
So, the final count is [11].
