Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (9, 7) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 9, and node 8
