Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph. To make it easier, we will classify the cycles based on their length: 
- Cycles of length 4: 
   - Cycle 1: (4, 7, 12, 0, 4)
   - Cycle 2: (4, 13, 9, 7, 4)
   - Cycle 3: (4, 9, 13, 8, 4)
   - Cycle 4: (4, 3, 1, 6, 4)
   - Cycle 5: (7, 4, 3, 1, 7)
   - Cycle 6: (7, 0, 12, 1, 7)
   - Cycle 7: (7, 9, 13, 10, 7)
   - Cycle 8: (1, 3, 4, 9, 1)
   - Cycle 9: (1, 6, 5, 12, 1)
   - Cycle 10: (1, 10, 13, 9, 1)
   - Cycle 11: (3, 4, 9, 11, 3)
   - Cycle 12: (3, 2, 14, 11, 3)
   - Cycle 13: (3, 8, 13, 10, 3)
   - Cycle 14: (8, 13, 10, 14, 8)
   - Cycle 15: (13, 9, 11, 14, 13)
   - Cycle 16: (12, 7, 4, 3, 12)
   - Cycle 17: (12, 1, 10, 13, 12)
   - Cycle 18: (2, 3, 8, 13, 2)
   - Cycle 19: (2, 0, 14, 11, 2)
   - Cycle 20: (0, 4, 3, 2, 0)
   - Cycle 21: (0, 14, 11, 9, 0)
   - Cycle 22: (14, 2, 3, 1, 14)
   - Cycle 23: (14, 10, 13, 9, 14)
   - Cycle 24: (5, 1, 3, 4, 5)
   - Cycle 25: (5, 10, 13, 9, 5)
   - Cycle 26: (6, 1, 3, 4, 6)
   - Cycle 27: (11, 3, 4, 9, 11)

Step 2: 
Out of these cycles, there are 6 chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord):
- Chordal Cycle 1: <1, (6, 4), 5>
- Chordal Cycle 2: <4, (9, 7), 13>
- Chordal Cycle 3: <1, (10, 13), 9>
- Chordal Cycle 4: <3, (8, 13), 10>
- Chordal Cycle 5: <11, (9, 13), 14>
- Chordal Cycle 6: <2, (3, 8), 13>

Step 3:
After identifying the chordal 4-cycles, we count the number of chordless 4-cycles found, which is [21].
