Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 2: (4, 5, 7, 6)
- Cycle 3: (0, 4, 5, 3)
- Cycle 4: (0, 4, 8, 7)
- Cycle 5: (1, 6, 5, 4)
- Cycle 6: (1, 3, 5, 4)
- Cycle 7: (2, 5, 4, 8)
- Cycle 8: (2, 5, 7, 6)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 3), making it a chordal 4-cycle. <1, (1, 3), 4>
- Cycle 2 has a chord (6, 7), making it a chordal 4-cycle. <2, (6, 7), 5>
- Cycle 3 has a chord (0, 4), making it a chordal 4-cycle. <3, (0, 4), 5>
- Cycle 4 has a chord (0, 7), making it a chordal 4-cycle. <4, (0, 7), 8>
- Cycle 5 has a chord (1, 6), making it a chordal 4-cycle. <5, (1, 6), 4>
- Cycle 6 has a chord (3, 4), making it a chordal 4-cycle. <6, (3, 4), 5>
- Cycle 7 has a chord (4, 8), making it a chordal 4-cycle. <7, (4, 8), 5>
- Cycle 8 has a chord (5, 6), making it a chordal 4-cycle. <8, (5, 6), 7>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [8].
