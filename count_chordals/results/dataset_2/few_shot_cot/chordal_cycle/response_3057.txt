Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 3, 2, 5> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 4, 3, 6> 
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 3, 2, 5> 
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 2, 5, 4> 
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 5, 4, 6> 
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 8, 3, 4> 
- Cycle 7: <2, 5, 4, 3, 6> 
- Cycle 8: <2, 3, 6, 4, 5> 
- Cycle 9: <2, 7, 1, 0, 6> 
- Cycle 10: <3, 6, 4, 5, 2> 
- Cycle 11: <3, 4, 1, 7, 2> 
- Cycle 12: <3, 4, 5, 2, 7> 
- Cycle 13: <4, 5, 2, 7, 1> 

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle: 
- Cycle 1: Chord <3, 5> 
- Cycle 2: Chord <0, 4> 
- Cycle 3: Chord <2, 5> 
- Cycle 4: Chord <1, 4> 
- Cycle 5: Chord <7, 4> 
- Cycle 6: Chord <1, 3> 
- Cycle 7: Chord <2, 4> 
- Cycle 8: Chord <3, 5> 
- Cycle 9: Chord <6, 1> 
- Cycle 10: Chord <3, 4> 
- Cycle 11: Chord <4, 7> 
- Cycle 12: Chord <5, 2> 
- Cycle 13: Chord <5, 1> 

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are 0 chordless cycles found. 

Therefore, the answer is [0].
