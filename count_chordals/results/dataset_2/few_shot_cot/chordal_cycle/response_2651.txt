Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more:  
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 6, 9, 0>    
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 6, 9, 1>  
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 7, 5, 1>    
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 4, 7, 1>   
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 9, 3, 1>     
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 4, 6, 1>    
- Cycle 7: <3, 6, 9, 1, 3>  
- Cycle 8: <3, 8, 6, 4, 3>    
- Cycle 9: <4, 6, 1, 7, 4>   
- Cycle 10: <6, 9, 3, 8, 6>    
- Cycle 11: <7, 4, 1, 6, 7>     
- Cycle 12: <9, 0, 5, 7, 9>     

Step 2:  
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (0, 6), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 9), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 has a chord (4, 5), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 4 has a chord (1, 7), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 5 has a chord (1, 9), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 6 has a chord (4, 7), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 7 has a chord (3, 9), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 8 has a chord (6, 4), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 9 has a chord (1, 6), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 10 has a chord (3, 8), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 11 has a chord (1, 6), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 12 has a chord (5, 9), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:  
Number of chordless cycles found: [0]
