Response:
Step 1: All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges are:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 6 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 5 - 7 - 14 - 0
- Cycle 3: 1 - 6 - 9 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 14 - 7 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 5: 2 - 6 - 9 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 6: 2 - 6 - 5 - 11 - 2
- Cycle 7: 2 - 14 - 7 - 5 - 2
- Cycle 8: 2 - 14 - 0 - 1 - 2
- Cycle 9: 3 - 9 - 6 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 10: 3 - 9 - 4 - 10 - 3
- Cycle 11: 3 - 12 - 14 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 12: 4 - 9 - 6 - 2 - 4
- Cycle 13: 4 - 9 - 3 - 12 - 4
- Cycle 14: 4 - 10 - 8 - 9 - 4
- Cycle 15: 5 - 11 - 7 - 14 - 5
- Cycle 16: 7 - 14 - 2 - 13 - 7

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Only Cycle 4: 1 - 6 - 9 - 8 - 1 has exactly one chord (6, 8).
- Only Cycle 7: 2 - 14 - 7 - 5 - 2 has exactly one chord (14, 5).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
Therefore, the final count is [0].
