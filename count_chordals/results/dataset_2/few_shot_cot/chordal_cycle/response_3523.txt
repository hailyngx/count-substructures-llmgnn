Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycles:
  <1, (9, 1), 6>
  <2, (3, 18), 0>
  <4, (7, 4), 2>
  <6, (9, 6), 0>
  <9, (1, 6), 11>
  <10, (6, 13), 9>
  <11, (16, 11), 14>
  <23, (9, 16), 12>
  <29, (7, 13), 4>
  <35, (16, 11), 14>
  <39, (9, 16), 14>
  <47, (4, 7), 17>
  <52, (9, 0), 6>
  <56, (9, 6), 0>
  <58, (0, 9), 6>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [15]
