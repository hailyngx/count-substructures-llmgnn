Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: 
1. Cycle: <0, 7, 5, 6>
2. Cycle: <0, 7, 9, 4>
3. Cycle: <0, 5, 1, 2>
4. Cycle: <0, 5, 6, 3>
5. Cycle: <1, 2, 6, 5>
6. Cycle: <1, 5, 6, 8>
7. Cycle: <2, 1, 8, 7>
8. Cycle: <3, 4, 7, 8>
9. Cycle: <3, 6, 9, 4>
10. Cycle: <4, 7, 5, 8>
11. Cycle: <5, 7, 4, 9>
12. Cycle: <6, 3, 8, 2>
13. Cycle: <6, 5, 8, 7>
14. Cycle: <7, 0, 5, 1>
15. Cycle: <7, 4, 9, 6>
16. Cycle: <8, 1, 5, 0>
17. Cycle: <8, 3, 6, 9>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, 7, 9, 4> (Chord: (7, 9))
2. <1, 2, 6, 5> (Chord: (2, 6))
3. <6, 3, 8, 2> (Chord: (3, 8))

Step 3:
