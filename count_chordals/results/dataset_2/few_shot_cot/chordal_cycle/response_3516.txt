Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 in the given graph:

<0, 8, 5, 14>
<0, 8, 11, 5>
<0, 13, 4, 7>
<0, 13, 11, 5>
<1, 9, 4, 13>
<1, 9, 4, 7>

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

<0, 8, 5, 14> --> Chord: (8, 5)
<0, 8, 11, 5> --> Chord: (8, 11)
<0, 13, 4, 7> --> Chord: (13, 4)
<0, 13, 11, 5> --> Chord: (11, 5)
<1, 9, 4, 13> --> Chord: (9, 13)
<1, 9, 4, 7> --> Chord: (9, 7)
<2, 6, 9, 4> --> Chord: (6, 4)
<2, 6, 3, 0> --> Chord: (6, 0)
<2, 6, 3, 12> --> Chord: (6, 12)
<2, 9, 4, 7> --> Chord: (9, 7)
<2, 4, 13, 11> --> Chord: (4, 11)
<2, 8, 11, 5> --> Chord: (8, 5)
<2, 12, 5, 8> --> Chord: (12, 8)
<3, 0, 13, 4> --> Chord: (0, 13)
<3, 6, 9, 1> --> Chord: (6, 1)
<3, 12, 5, 14> --> Chord: (12, 14)
<4, 13, 11, 5> --> Chord: (13, 11)
<4, 10, 12, 5> --> Chord: (10, 12)
<5, 8, 4, 13> --> Chord: (8, 13)
<5, 8, 11, 7> --> Chord: (8, 11)
<5, 8, 11, 13> --> Chord: (8, 11)
<5, 12, 10, 14> --> Chord: (12, 10)
<7, 4, 13, 11> --> Chord: (4, 11)
<8, 4, 9, 6> --> Chord: (4, 9)
<8, 4, 13, 0> --> Chord: (4, 13)
<10, 4, 13, 11> --> Chord: (4, 13)
<10, 12, 5, 14> --> Chord: (12, 14)
<11, 7, 14, 2> --> Chord: (7, 14)
<11, 8, 4, 9> --> Chord: (8, 9)
<11, 8, 4, 13> --> Chord: (8, 13)
<12, 2, 6, 9> --> Chord: (2, 6)
<12, 2, 14, 5> --> Chord: (2, 14)
<13, 4, 10, 12> --> Chord: (4, 10)
<14, 7, 11, 8> --> Chord: (7, 11)

Step 3: 
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
