Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 4, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 4, 2, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 2, 4, 3, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 4, 3, 0, 2>
- Cycle 5: <4, 1, 2, 8, 4>
- Cycle 6: <4, 3, 0, 6, 4>
- Cycle 7: <4, 2, 8, 9, 4>
- Cycle 8: <7, 5, 6, 2, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 4)  
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (0, 6)  
- Cycle 3 has no chords  
- Cycle 4 has no chords  
- Cycle 5 has no chords  
- Cycle 6 has no chords  
- Cycle 7 has no chords  
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (5, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.  
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found.  
Therefore, the final number to put inside brackets is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:  
<0, 9, 4, 1, 7, 0> with chord (1, 4)  
<0, 9, 4, 2, 6, 0> with chord (0, 6)  
<7, 5, 6, 2, 7> with chord (5, 2)
