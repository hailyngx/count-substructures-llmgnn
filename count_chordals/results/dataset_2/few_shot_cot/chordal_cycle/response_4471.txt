Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 5, 8, 7>
- <0, 5, 6, 9>
- <0, 6, 5, 8>
- <0, 6, 12, 4>
- <0, 14, 1, 12>
- <0, 14, 4, 11>
- <1, 8, 5, 0>
- <1, 8, 7, 11>
- <1, 12, 6, 5>
- <1, 14, 4, 11>
- <2, 7, 11, 3>
- <2, 9, 6, 5>
- <4, 10, 6, 5>
- <4, 11, 7, 8>
- <4, 12, 6, 5>
- <4, 14, 9, 6>
- <5, 6, 12, 4>
- <5, 8, 7, 11>
- <6, 9, 14, 4>
- <7, 8, 5, 0>
- <9, 6, 12, 4>
- <10, 6, 5, 8>
- <10, 13, 0, 5>
- <10, 14, 9, 6>
- <11, 7, 8, 5>
- <11, 13, 0, 5>
- <12, 6, 5, 8>
- <13, 10, 6, 5>
- <13, 11, 7, 8>
- <14, 9, 6, 5>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <0, 5, 8, 7> with chord (5, 7)

Step 3:
There is 1 chordless cycle found, so the final count is [1].
