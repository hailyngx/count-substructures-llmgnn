Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 2, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (3, 6, 0, 9)
- Cycle 2: (3, 1, 7, 4)
- Cycle 3: (3, 1, 8, 4)
- Cycle 4: (3, 1, 5, 7)
- Cycle 5: (3, 2, 7, 4)
- Cycle 6: (3, 2, 8, 4)
- Cycle 7: (3, 2, 4, 7)
- Cycle 8: (1, 7, 5, 3)
- Cycle 9: (1, 7, 8, 4)
- Cycle 10: (1, 7, 5, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (2, 4)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (7, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles.
Therefore, the final count is [0].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<3, 9, 6, 0>
<3, 1, 7, 4>
<3, 1, 8, 4>
<3, 1, 5, 7>
<3, 2, 7, 4>
<3, 2, 8, 4>
<3, 2, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 5, 3>
<1, 7, 8, 4>
<1, 7, 5, 3>
