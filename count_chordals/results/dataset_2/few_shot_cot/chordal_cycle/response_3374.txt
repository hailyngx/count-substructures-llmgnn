Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 in the graph are as follows:
1. 0-5-9-4-0
2. 0-5-8-7-0
3. 0-5-1-6-0
4. 0-5-4-6-0
5. 1-5-4-2-1
6. 1-5-0-9-1
7. 1-5-8-7-1
8. 2-4-5-8-2
9. 2-4-6-1-2
10. 3-7-5-8-3
11. 3-7-0-5-3
12. 4-5-9-0-4
13. 4-5-1-6-4
14. 4-5-0-6-4
15. 4-9-5-8-4
16. 5-9-4-6-5
17. 5-9-0-7-5
18. 5-9-4-2-5
19. 5-8-4-6-5
20. 5-8-7-0-5
21. 5-8-4-2-5
22. 6-1-5-4-6
23. 6-1-0-3-6
24. 6-4-5-1-6
25. 6-4-2-0-6
26. 7-0-5-8-7
27. 7-0-3-1-7
28. 7-5-4-8-7
29. 7-5-0-3-7
30. 8-5-4-2-8
31. 8-5-7-0-8
32. 8-5-4-6-8
33. 9-5-4-0-9
34. 9-5-0-1-9
35. 9-4-5-0-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
<3, (7, 5), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 34 chordless 4-cycles.

Final Answer: [34]
