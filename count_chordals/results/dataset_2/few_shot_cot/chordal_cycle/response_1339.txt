Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 14, 8, 13, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 9, 5, 4, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 8, 13, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 8, 14, 12, 2>
- Cycle 6: <3, 8, 14, 11, 3>
- Cycle 7: <4, 5, 9, 12, 4>
- Cycle 8: <4, 6, 3, 11, 4>
- Cycle 9: <6, 3, 13, 14, 6>
- Cycle 10: <7, 5, 9, 12, 7>
- Cycle 11: <10, 8, 14, 12, 10>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 7-5
- Cycle 2 has a chord 7-14
- Cycle 3 has a chord 9-1
- Cycle 4 has a chord 9-13
- Cycle 5 has a chord 8-12
- Cycle 6 has a chord 8-14
- Cycle 7 has a chord 5-12
- Cycle 8 has a chord 6-11
- Cycle 9 has a chord 3-14
- Cycle 10 has a chord 5-12
- Cycle 11 has a chord 8-14

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
