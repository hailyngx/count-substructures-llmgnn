Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (1, 9, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 9, 7, 4, 1)

- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 4, 5, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 7, 4, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 7, 8, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 3, 4, 1)
- Cycle 10: (2, 9, 4, 1, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 9, 4, 3, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 9, 1, 4, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 1, 3, 4, 2)
- Cycle 14: (2, 1, 7, 8, 2)
- Cycle 15: (2, 1, 5, 4, 2)
- Cycle 16: (3, 4, 7, 1, 3)
- Cycle 17: (4, 9, 2, 8, 4)
- Cycle 18: (4, 9, 7, 1, 4)
- Cycle 19: (4, 9, 1, 3, 4)
- Cycle 20: (4, 5, 1, 3, 4)
- Cycle 21: (4, 5, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 22: (4, 7, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 23: (5, 1, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 24: (5, 1, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 25: (5, 4, 9, 2, 5)
- Cycle 26: (5, 4, 7, 6, 5)
- Cycle 27: (6, 9, 7, 1, 6)
- Cycle 28: (6, 9, 4, 5, 6)
- Cycle 29: (7, 9, 4, 1, 7)
- Cycle 30: (8, 7, 4, 9, 8)
- Cycle 31: (8, 7, 1, 4, 8)
- Cycle 32: (8, 1, 9, 2, 8)
- Cycle 33: (8, 1, 3, 4, 8)
- Cycle 34: (9, 4, 7, 1, 9)
- Cycle 35: (9, 4, 3, 1, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

The chordal 4-cycle is: <<1, (2, 9), 4, 3)> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are [34] chordless cycles in the graph.
