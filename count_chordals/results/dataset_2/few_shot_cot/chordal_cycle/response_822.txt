Response:
In this graph, there are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles. The chordal 4-cycles are as follows:
<1, 23, 26, 0>, <1, 9, 11, 20>, <5, 18, 12, 19>, <5, 19, 14, 28>, <7, 28, 15, 21>, <9, 1, 2, 25>, <9, 4, 6, 23>, <13, 10, 22, 5>, <16, 13, 4, 9>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
