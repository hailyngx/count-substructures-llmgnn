Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 7) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 18) (17, 3) (17, 16) (17, 9) (18, 17) (18, 2) (18, 15) (2, 18) (2, 16) (2, 15) (2, 4) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 1) (6, 5) (6, 19) (6, 8) (6, 0) (13, 14) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (7, 14) (7, 13) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 12) (9, 17) (9, 11) (11, 13) (11, 9) (11, 15) (3, 17) (3, 12) (16, 17) (16, 2) (16, 1) (19, 6) (19, 10) (4, 2) (4, 1) (15, 18) (15, 2) (15, 11) (15, 12) (1, 5) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 12) (10, 19) (12, 8) (12, 3) (12, 15) (12, 1)

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
- There are no chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.

Step 3:
- After checking all cycles, the number of chordless cycles found is 0.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
