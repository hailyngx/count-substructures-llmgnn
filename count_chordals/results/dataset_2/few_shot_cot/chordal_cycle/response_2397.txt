Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
1. <0, 3, 10, 5>
2. <0, 12, 2, 10>
3. <0, 12, 4, 1>
4. <0, 5, 1, 4>
5. <2, 10, 5, 11>
6. <2, 7, 6, 10>
7. <3, 4, 1, 9>
8. <3, 9, 1, 4>
9. <3, 9, 8, 11>
10. <3, 13, 12, 10>
11. <4, 1, 9, 3>
12. <4, 12, 13, 3>
13. <4, 14, 6, 13>
14. <5, 1, 9, 3>
15. <5, 10, 2, 7>
16. <6, 10, 7, 2>
17. <6, 8, 11, 7>
18. <6, 13, 12, 4>
19. <6, 14, 4, 1>
20. <6, 14, 12, 10>
21. <8, 9, 1, 4>
22. <8, 9, 3, 10>
23. <10, 2, 12, 4>
24. <10, 11, 5, 1>
25. <11, 8, 9, 1>
26. <11, 13, 12, 10>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
- <<3, 4, 12, 13>, (3, 12)> (Chord: 3-12)>
  
Step 3: 
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord in the graph. 
Therefore, the final count is [1].
