Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- There are several cycles in the graph:
  - Cycle 1: <1, 20, 17, 24, 9, 25, 4, 7, 6, 3, 14, 28, 27, 15, 16, 2, 10, 21, 8, 0, 13>
  - Cycle 2: <22, 7, 4, 25, 9, 24, 17, 20, 10, 2, 16, 15, 27, 5>
  - Cycle 3: <26, 18, 12, 8, 23, 7, 6, 3, 14, 28, 27, 15, 16, 2, 10, 21, 29, 13, 0>
  - Cycle 4: <11, 16, 2, 10, 21, 29, 13, 26, 18, 12>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (8, 13), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
Since Cycle 3 is the only chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [3]. 

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <8, 13> with the final count as [3].
