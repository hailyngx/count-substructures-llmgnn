Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. <0, 5, 8, 4, 3>
2. <0, 5, 9, 6, 7>
3. <1, 2, 4, 8, 5>
4. <2, 4, 8, 5, 9>
5. <2, 7, 8, 5, 9>
6. <3, 5, 9, 7, 6>
7. <3, 4, 8, 5, 9>
8. <4, 5, 9, 7, 6>
9. <5, 9, 7, 6, 0>
10. <5, 8, 7, 9, 6>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 5, 8, 4, 3> has a chord: (5, 8)
- <0, 5, 9, 6, 7> has a chord: (5, 9)
- <1, 2, 4, 8, 5> has a chord: (2, 8)
- <2, 4, 8, 5, 9> has a chord: (4, 9)
- <2, 7, 8, 5, 9> has a chord: (7, 9)
- <3, 5, 9, 7, 6> has a chord: (5, 7)
- <3, 4, 8, 5, 9> has a chord: (4, 8)
- <4, 5, 9, 7, 6> has a chord: (5, 7)
- <5, 9, 7, 6, 0> has a chord: (9, 6)
- <5, 8, 7, 9, 6> has a chord: (8, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0] 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
