Response:
The graph has the following unique chordal 4-cycle, <1, 3, 5, 14>, with the chord (1, 5): 

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 5, 14)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 7, 14)
- Cycle 3: (3, 5, 7, 2)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 14, 9)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the answer is [1].
