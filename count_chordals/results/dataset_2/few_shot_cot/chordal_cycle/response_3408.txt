Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, including:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-4-7-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-9-4-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-9-6-2-7-0
- Cycle 4: 1-9-5-4-7-2-6-1
- Cycle 5: 1-9-5-0-8-1
- Cycle 6: 1-9-5-3-7-2-6-1
- Cycle 7: 2-5-9-6-2
- Cycle 8: 3-5-9-6-2-7-3
- Cycle 9: 3-5-9-4-7-0-8-3
- Cycle 10: 4-5-9-6-2-7-4

Step 2:
After checking each cycle, the cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-4-7-0 with a chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 2: 0-5-9-4-0 with a chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 3: 0-5-9-6-2-7-0 with a chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 9: 3-5-9-4-7-0-8-3 with a chord (5, 7)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 4, 5, 0> 
- <1, 5, 9, 0> 
- <3, 4, 5, 7>
