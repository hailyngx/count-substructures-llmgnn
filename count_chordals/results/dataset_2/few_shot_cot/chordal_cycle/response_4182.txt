Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. (5, 9, 0, 8, 5) - 4-cycle
2. (5, 9, 6, 7, 5) - 4-cycle
3. (5, 3, 7, 4, 5) - 4-cycle
4. (9, 1, 5, 4, 9) - 4-cycle
5. (9, 0, 2, 4, 9) - 4-cycle
6. (9, 1, 5, 6, 9) - 4-cycle
7. (6, 7, 4, 8, 6) - 4-cycle
8. (4, 7, 3, 5, 4) - 4-cycle
9. (7, 3, 5, 9, 7) - 4-cycle
10. (8, 4, 5, 3, 8) - 4-cycle
11. (8, 0, 2, 4, 8) - 4-cycle

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. (5, 9, 0, 8, 5) - Chord: (9, 8)
2. (5, 3, 7, 4, 5) - Chord: (3, 7)
3. (9, 0, 2, 4, 9) - Chord: (0, 2)
4. (9, 1, 5, 6, 9) - Chord: (1, 6)
5. (4, 7, 3, 5, 4) - Chord: (7, 3)

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final count is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, (9, 8), 5>
2. <3, (3, 7), 5>
3. <9, (0, 2), 4>
4. <9, (1, 6), 5>
5. <4, (7, 3), 5>
