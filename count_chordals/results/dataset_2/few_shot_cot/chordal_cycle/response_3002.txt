Response:
Step 1: 
We have cycles with length 4 or more as follows:
- Cycle 1: (0, 10, 1, 8, 13)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 7, 8, 13)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 12, 8, 13)
- Cycle 4: (0, 4, 10, 1, 8)
- Cycle 5: (1, 2, 7, 8, 13)
- Cycle 6: (1, 10, 12, 8, 13)
- Cycle 7: (2, 7, 8, 13, 9)
- Cycle 8: (3, 8, 1, 10, 4)
- Cycle 9: (3, 5, 0, 6, 12)
- Cycle 10: (3, 9, 14, 4, 10)
- Cycle 11: (3, 14, 4, 10, 1)
- Cycle 12: (4, 13, 8, 1, 10)
- Cycle 13: (4, 14, 9, 13, 8)
- Cycle 14: (5, 0, 10, 1, 8)
- Cycle 15: (5, 7, 8, 13, 4)
- Cycle 16: (6, 0, 10, 1, 8)
- Cycle 17: (6, 11, 2, 7, 8)
- Cycle 18: (7, 5, 0, 10, 4)
- Cycle 19: (7, 9, 13, 8, 1)
- Cycle 20: (7, 12, 8, 1, 10)
- Cycle 21: (8, 13, 9, 14, 4)
- Cycle 22: (10, 0, 5, 3, 9)
- Cycle 23: (10, 1, 2, 7, 12)
- Cycle 24: (10, 4, 13, 9, 14)
- Cycle 25: (11, 6, 0, 5, 3)
- Cycle 26: (12, 6, 0, 5, 7)
- Cycle 27: (12, 7, 8, 1, 10)

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (10, 4), 9>
- <2, (7, 8), 13>
- <3, (1, 10), 4>
- <4, (5, 0), 3>
- <5, (7, 12), 8>
- <6, (9, 13), 4>
- <7, (0, 5), 3>
- <8, (6, 0), 5>

Step 3:
Total number of chordless cycles found = [8]
