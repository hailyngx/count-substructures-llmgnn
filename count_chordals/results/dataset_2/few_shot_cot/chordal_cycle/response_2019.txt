Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 17, 14, 6)
- Cycle 2: (1, 17, 11, 6)
- Cycle 3: (1, 17, 14, 20)
- Cycle 4: (1, 25, 22, 16)
- Cycle 5: (1, 25, 22, 15)
- Cycle 6: (2, 3, 13, 29)
- Cycle 7: (2, 3, 13, 29)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordless cycles: 0

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
