Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <0, 6, 3, 9, (0, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <0, 14, 9, 4, (0, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <1, 9, 4, 12, (9, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <1, 11, 14, 8, (1, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <1, 7, 12, 10, (7, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <2, 11, 12, 4, (11, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <3, 9, 1, 10, (9, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <3, 10, 1, 7, (10, 12)>
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <4, 9, 1, 7, (9, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <5, 7, 12, 10, (7, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <8, 14, 9, 4, (14, 11)>
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <10, 11, 2, 7, (11, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <10, 12, 7, 5, (12, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <11, 12, 4, 6, (12, 7)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 58 chordless 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final count is [58].
