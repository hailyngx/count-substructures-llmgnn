Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <1, 2, 3, 4, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 10, 4, 19, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 12, 9, 15, 6, 16, 13, 11, 7, 18, 0, 14, 8, 17, 10, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 3, 14, 8, 17, 5, 11, 7, 18, 16, 6, 15, 9, 12, 1>
- Cycle 5: <3, 2, 19, 8, 17, 5, 11, 13, 16, 18, 7, 0, 14, 3>
- Cycle 6: <3, 4, 10, 17, 5, 11, 13, 16, 6, 15, 9, 12, 1, 2, 3>
- Cycle 7: <4, 19, 8, 17, 10, 1, 12, 9, 15, 6, 16, 13, 11, 5, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, 2, 3, 4, 1> (Chord: None)
- Cycle 2: <1, 10, 4, 19, 1> (Chord: (1, 4))
- Cycle 3: <1, 12, 9, 15, 6, 16, 13, 11, 7, 18, 0, 14, 8, 17, 10, 1> (Chord: None)
- Cycle 4: <2, 3, 14, 8, 17, 5, 11, 7, 18, 16, 6, 15, 9, 12, 1> (Chord: (2, 8))
- Cycle 5: <3, 2, 19, 8, 17, 5, 11, 13, 16, 18, 7, 0, 14, 3> (Chord: (3, 16))
- Cycle 6: <3, 4, 10, 17, 5, 11, 13, 16, 6, 15, 9, 12, 1, 2, 3> (Chord: (3, 10))
- Cycle 7: <4, 19, 8, 17, 10, 1, 12, 9, 15, 6, 16, 13, 11, 5, 8> (Chord: (4, 8))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are [4] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
