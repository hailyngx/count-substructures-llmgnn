39. <25, 27, 29, 1> 
40. <26, 7, 6, 15>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Among the cycles listed above, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
<0, 29, 1, 13> with a chord between nodes 1 and 13.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- As there is one chordal 4-cycle found, the count of chordless cycles is [39].
