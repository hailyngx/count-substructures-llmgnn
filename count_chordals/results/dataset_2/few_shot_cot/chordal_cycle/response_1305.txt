Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 20, 26, 13>
2. <0, 20, 26, 16>
3. <0, 20, 10, 13>
4. <0, 20, 10, 11>
5. <0, 25, 8, 18>
6. <1, 20, 10, 11>
7. <1, 27, 2, 17>
8. <1, 7, 8, 18>
9. <2, 27, 1, 7>
10. <2, 27, 1, 20>
11. <2, 17, 9, 23>
12. <2, 17, 11, 10>
13. <3, 14, 21, 18>
14. <3, 14, 12, 13>
15. <4, 28, 24, 21>
16. <4, 28, 26, 13>
17. <5, 8, 18, 21>
18. <5, 8, 25, 22>
19. <5, 12, 13, 26>
20. <6, 11, 17, 9>
21. <7, 1, 20, 0>
22. <7, 8, 18, 21>
23. <8, 18, 21, 24>
24. <8, 25, 0, 23>
25. <9, 17, 2, 27>
26. <9, 23, 19, 24>
27. <10, 20, 1, 7>
28. <10, 13, 26, 16>
29. <11, 17, 2, 27>
30. <12, 13, 26, 16>
31. <12, 16, 25, 22>
32. <13, 26, 28, 24>
33. <14, 21, 24, 19>
34. <15, 27, 2, 17>
35. <16, 25, 22, 7>
36. <19, 24, 28, 26>
37. <20, 26, 28, 24>
38. <21, 24, 19, 23>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <3, 14, 21, 18> with chord (12, 13)
2. <2, 27, 1, 20> with chord (10, 11)
3. <2, 17, 9, 23> with chord (0, 20)
4. <10, 13, 26, 16> with chord (8, 18)
5. <1, 20, 10, 11> with chord (7, 8)

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [33].
