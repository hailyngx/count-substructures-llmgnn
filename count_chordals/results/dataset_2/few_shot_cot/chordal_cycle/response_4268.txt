Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in this graph are as follows: 

Step 1: 
- Cycle: <5, 11, 1, 5> with chord (1, 11)
- Cycle: <5, 1, 3, 11> with chord (1, 11)
- Cycle: <5, 4, 0, 11> with chord (4, 11)
- Cycle: <5, 4, 13, 6> with chord (4, 6)
- Cycle: <9, 7, 12, 10> with chord (7, 12)
- Cycle: <9, 10, 12, 7> with chord (10, 7)
- Cycle: <1, 14, 6, 13> with chord (14, 6)
- Cycle: <3, 13, 6, 14> with chord (13, 6)
- Cycle: <2, 8, 6, 14> with chord (8, 6)
- Cycle: <4, 13, 6, 8> with chord (13, 8)

Step 2: 
- Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
  <5, 11, 1, 5> with chord (1, 11)
  <5, 1, 3, 11> with chord (1, 11)
  <5, 4, 0, 11> with chord (4, 11)
  <5, 4, 13, 6> with chord (4, 6)
  <9, 7, 12, 10> with chord (7, 12)
  <9, 10, 12, 7> with chord (10, 7)
  <1, 14, 6, 13> with chord (14, 6)
  <3, 13, 6, 14> with chord (13, 6)
  <2, 8, 6, 14> with chord (8, 6)
  <4, 13, 6, 8> with chord (13, 8)

Step 3: 
As there are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord, the number of chordless cycles is [10].
