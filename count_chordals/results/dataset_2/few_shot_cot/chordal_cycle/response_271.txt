Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 4, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 9, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 7, 6, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 4, 9, 2, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 3, 7, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 5, 4, 9, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 5, 2, 0, 3>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 4, 5, 0> has a chord (1, 4)
- <0, 1, 9, 7, 0> has a chord (1, 7)
- <0, 3, 7, 6, 0> has a chord (3, 6)
- <1, 4, 9, 2, 1> has a chord (4, 9)
- <1, 6, 3, 7, 1> has a chord (3, 6)
- <2, 5, 4, 9, 2> has a chord (4, 5)
- <3, 5, 2, 0, 3> has a chord (2, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordless cycles = [0]
