Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 9, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. (0, 4, 1, 5)
2. (0, 4, 7, 1)
3. (0, 4, 6, 2)
4. (0, 5, 2, 7)
5. (1, 4, 7, 2)
6. (1, 4, 0, 9)
7. (1, 7, 2, 3)
8. (1, 7, 8, 6)
9. (2, 7, 4, 3)
10. (2, 7, 8, 6)
11. (4, 7, 2, 3)
12. (4, 0, 7, 2)
13. (4, 1, 7, 2)
14. (5, 2, 7, 8)
15. (6, 4, 7, 8)
16. (6, 4, 0, 9)
17. (6, 2, 7, 1)
18. (7, 4, 0, 9)
19. (7, 4, 6, 2)
20. (7, 1, 5, 2)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, (4, 7), 2>: (1, 4, 7, 2) with chord (4, 7)
2. <2, (4, 7), 3>: (2, 7, 4, 3) with chord (4, 7)

Step 3:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
Thus, the final count is [2].
