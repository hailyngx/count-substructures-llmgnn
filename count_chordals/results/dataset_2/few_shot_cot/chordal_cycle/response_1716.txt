Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 3) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, 2, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 0, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, we cannot find any chordal 4-cycles.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 0.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
