Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 11, 3, 5>
- Cycle 2: <13, 18, 1, 16, 17, 10, 4, 13>
- Cycle 3: <14, 19, 0, 12, 11, 9, 14>
- Cycle 4: <6, 14, 19, 0, 6>
- Cycle 5: <6, 14, 9, 5, 3, 16, 8, 6>
- Cycle 6: <3, 16, 1, 10, 4, 10, 17, 16, 3>
- Cycle 7: <3, 16, 8, 11, 12, 0, 19, 14, 6, 15, 3>
- Cycle 8: <0, 17, 10, 1, 18, 13, 12, 0>
- Cycle 9: <14, 19, 10, 1, 18, 13, 12, 11, 9, 14>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (0, 12)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (19, 14)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (14, 9)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (17, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles identified in the graph based on the above steps.

Therefore, the final count is [4].
