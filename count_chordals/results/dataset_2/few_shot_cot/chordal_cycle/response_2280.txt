Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 7, 4, 0>
- <1, 9, 5, 3, 1>
- <2, 4, 7, 2>
- <3, 5, 7, 4, 3>
- <4, 7, 2, 8, 4>
- <5, 9, 1, 3, 5>
- <6, 5, 7, 6>
- <7, 4, 8, 2, 7>
- <8, 9, 1, 8>
- <9, 5, 7, 4, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 7, 4, 0> has chord (5, 4)
- <1, 9, 5, 3, 1> has chord (9, 3)
- <2, 4, 7, 2> has chord (4, 7)
- <3, 5, 7, 4, 3> has chord (5, 4)
- <4, 7, 2, 8, 4> has chord (7, 8)
- <5, 9, 1, 3, 5> has chord (9, 1)
- <6, 5, 7, 6> has chord (5, 7)
- <7, 4, 8, 2, 7> has chord (4, 8)
- <8, 9, 1, 8> has chord (9, 1)
- <9, 5, 7, 4, 9> has chord (5, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
