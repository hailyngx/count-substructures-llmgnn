Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 18, 15, 2, 9>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 5, 16, 12>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 19, 12, 16>
- Cycle 4: <5, 16, 12, 19, 6>
- Cycle 5: <5, 16, 12, 13, 7>
- Cycle 6: <5, 14, 4, 17, 15>
- Cycle 7: <9, 2, 11, 13, 18>
- Cycle 8: <9, 15, 17, 6, 19>
- Cycle 9: <9, 15, 18, 13, 7>
- Cycle 10: <10, 11, 13, 7, 19>
- Cycle 11: <11, 10, 12, 19, 6>
- Cycle 12: <11, 13, 18, 15, 9>
- Cycle 13: <12, 10, 11, 13, 7>
- Cycle 14: <12, 16, 14, 4, 17>
- Cycle 15: <13, 11, 2, 9, 1>
- Cycle 16: <13, 7, 19, 6, 18>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 18, 15, 2> (Chord: (0, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 1, 5, 16> (Chord: (1, 12))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 1, 19, 12> (Chord: (1, 19))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, 16, 12, 19> (Chord: (12, 16))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5 ,16, 12, 13> (Chord: (16, 12))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, 14, 4, 17> (Chord: (5, 14))
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <9, 2, 11, 13> (Chord: (11, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <9, 15, 17, 6> (Chord: (15, 17))
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, 15, 18, 13> (Chord: (9, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, 11, 13, 7> (Chord: (11, 10))
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <11, 10, 12, 19> (Chord: (11, 12))
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <11, 13, 18, 15> (Chord: (13, 15))
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <12, 10, 11, 13> (Chord: (12, 10))
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <12, 16, 14, 4> (Chord: (14, 16))
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <13, 11, 2, 9> (Chord: (9, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <13, 7, 19, 6> (Chord: (13, 19))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
