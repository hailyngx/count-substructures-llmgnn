Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <1, 21, 20, 25> (Chord: (21, 20))
- <1, 21, 25, 27> (Chord: (21, 27))
- <21, 20, 25, 18> (Chord: (20, 18))
- <3, 15, 17, 13> (Chord: (15, 17))
- <15, 17, 13, 9> (Chord: (17, 9))
- <22, 12, 24, 5> (Chord: (12, 5))
- <22, 8, 6, 0> (Chord: (8, 6))
- <23, 29, 27, 25> (Chord: (29, 27))
- <27, 25, 21, 11> (Chord: (25, 21))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count is [8].
