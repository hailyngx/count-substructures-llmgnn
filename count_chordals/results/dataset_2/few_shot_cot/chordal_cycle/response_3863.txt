Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 14, 5, 3>
- <0, 14, 5, 11>
- <0, 3, 5, 11>
- <0, 1, 9, 11>
- <0, 1, 7, 4>
- <0, 1, 7, 11>
- <0, 1, 6, 4>
- <0, 1, 6, 14>
- <0, 3, 9, 13>
- <0, 3, 8, 13>
- <1, 9, 11, 7>
- <1, 9, 11, 13>
- <1, 7, 4, 13>
- <1, 7, 10, 9>
- <1, 6, 14, 5>
- <1, 6, 4, 13>
- <2, 6, 4, 13>
- <2, 6, 8, 13>
- <2, 10, 9, 11>
- <3, 5, 11, 2>
- <3, 5, 14, 6>
- <3, 9, 11, 2>
- <3, 2, 6, 14>
- <4, 5, 7, 12>
- <4, 7, 11, 13>
- <4, 7, 10, 8>
- <4, 13, 9, 11>
- <4, 13, 8, 6>
- <5, 11, 9, 13>
- <6, 4, 13, 8>
- <6, 8, 10, 7>
- <6, 14, 5, 11>
- <6, 14, 0, 1>
- <7, 4, 13, 8>
- <7, 11, 9, 13>
- <8, 13, 9, 11>
- <9, 11, 7, 4>
- <9, 11, 13, 8>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 7, 4> (Chord: 7-4)
- <1, 7, 4, 13> (Chord: 4-13)
- <6, 8, 10, 7> (Chord: 10-7)
- <8, 13, 9, 11> (Chord: 9-11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [34].
