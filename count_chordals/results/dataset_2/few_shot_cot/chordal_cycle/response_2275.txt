Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3)

Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <5, 9, 6, 7, 5>
2. <5, 9, 6, 2, 5>
3. <5, 9, 4, 7, 5>
4. <5, 9, 4, 8, 5>
5. <5, 4, 7, 6, 5>
6. <5, 4, 7, 0, 5>
7. <5, 4, 8, 1, 5>
8. <5, 4, 9, 6, 5>
9. <5, 1, 7, 6, 5>
10. <5, 1, 7, 4, 5>
11. <5, 1, 6, 9, 5>
12. <5, 1, 6, 2, 5>
13. <5, 1, 3, 0, 5>
14. <5, 1, 3, 1, 5>
15. <5, 8, 4, 7, 5>
16. <5, 8, 4, 9, 5>
17. <5, 8, 1, 7, 5>
18. <9, 4, 7, 6, 9>
19. <9, 4, 7, 0, 9>
20. <9, 4, 8, 1, 9>
21. <9, 4, 8, 5, 9>
22. <9, 6, 7, 4, 9>
23. <9, 6, 7, 1, 9>
24. <9, 6, 1, 5, 9>
25. <9, 6, 1, 3, 9>
26. <4, 7, 0, 5, 4>
27. <4, 7, 6, 9, 4>
28. <4, 8, 9, 6, 4>
29. <7, 0, 5, 4, 7>
30. <7, 6, 9, 4, 7>
31. <6, 1, 5, 4, 6>
32. <6, 1, 3, 9, 6>
33. <1, 7, 4, 8, 1>
34. <1, 7, 6, 9, 1>
35. <1, 6, 9, 4, 1>
36. <1, 6, 2, 5, 1>
37. <1, 3, 0, 5, 1>
38. <1, 3, 1, 7, 1>
39. <3, 0, 5, 1, 3>
40. <8, 4, 7, 6, 8>
41. <8, 4, 9, 6, 8>
42. <8, 1, 7, 4, 8>
43. <2, 5, 1, 6, 2>
44. <2, 5, 1, 3, 2>
45. <2, 9, 4, 8, 2>
46. <2, 9, 6, 7, 2>
47. <0, 5, 1, 3, 0>
Let's continue to Step 2 to identify chordal 4-cycles.
