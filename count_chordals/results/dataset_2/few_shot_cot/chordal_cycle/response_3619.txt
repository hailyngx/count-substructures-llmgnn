Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 5, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 9, 2, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 9, 8, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 2, 9, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 9, 5, 7, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Checking Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 5, 0> does not have a chord.
- Checking Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 5, 0> does not have a chord.
- Checking Cycle 3: <1, 5, 7, 4, 1> has a chord: (5, 4).
- Checking Cycle 4: <1, 5, 9, 2, 1> does not have a chord.
- Checking Cycle 5: <1, 5, 9, 8, 1> does not have a chord.
- Checking Cycle 6: <1, 6, 2, 9, 1> does not have a chord.
- Checking Cycle 7: <2, 9, 5, 7, 2> has a chord: (5, 7).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Since there are 3 chordless cycles found in the graph, the final count is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <0, (4, 7), 5, 1>
- <1, (5, 2), 9, 8>
- <1, (6, 9), 2, 5>
