Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:
- <0, 12, 4, 13, 1, 0>
- <0, 12, 4, 13, 6, 14, 10, 5, 12, 0>
- <0, 12, 4, 13, 6, 14, 4, 9, 0>
- <0, 12, 4, 13, 6, 1, 2, 0>
- <0, 12, 5, 10, 13, 4, 12, 0>
- <0, 12, 1, 2, 9, 0>
- <0, 1, 6, 13, 4, 12, 2, 0>
  
Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 12, 4, 13, 1, 0> has a chord (4, 1)
- <0, 12, 1, 2, 9, 0> has a chord (1, 9)
  
Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, 12, 4, 13, 6, 14, 10, 5, 12, 0>
