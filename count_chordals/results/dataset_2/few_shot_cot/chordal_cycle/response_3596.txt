- <0, 9, 7, 3> has no chords
- <0, 9, 7, 2> has one chord <9, 7>
- <0, 9, 2, 4> has one chord <9, 2>
- <0, 9, 2, 7> has no chords
- <0, 9, 2, 3> has no chords
- <0, 8, 4, 7> has one chord <8, 4>
- <0, 8, 4, 3> has one chord <8, 4>
- <0, 8, 7, 4> has no chords
- <0, 8, 7, 2> has one chord <8, 7>
- <0, 8, 7, 3> has one chord <8, 7>
- <0, 8, 5, 1> has no chords
- <0, 8, 5, 1, 6> has one chord <8, 1>
- <2, 4, 7, 3> has one chord <4, 7>
