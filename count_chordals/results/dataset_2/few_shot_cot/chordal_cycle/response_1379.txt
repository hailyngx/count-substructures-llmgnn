Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles with 4 or more nodes: 

1. Cycle 0-6-2-9-5-1-4-8
2. Cycle 0-6-3-4-8-7-2-9
3. Cycle 0-2-9-8-4-5-1-7
4. Cycle 0-2-7-6-9-8-4-3

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:

1. Cycle 0-6-2-9-5-1-4-8 has a chord (5, 8)
2. Cycle 0-6-3-4-8-7-2-9 has a chord (4, 9)
3. Cycle 0-2-9-8-4-5-1-7 has a chord (9, 1)
4. Cycle 0-2-7-6-9-8-4-3 has a chord (7, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
Since all the cycles had exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, 6, 2, 9, 5, 1, 4, 8>: (5, 8)
<0, 6, 3, 4, 8, 7, 2, 9>: (4, 9)
<0, 2, 9, 8, 4, 5, 1, 7>: (9, 1)
<0, 2, 7, 6, 9, 8, 4, 3>: (7, 4)
