Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycles of length 4:
    - <0, 4, 1, 7, 0>
    - <0, 4, 6, 7, 0>
    - <1, 4, 6, 7, 1>
    - <2, 6, 7, 8, 2>
    - <3, 5, 9, 2, 3>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- The cycle <0, 4, 6, 7, 0> has exactly one chord 4-7.
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- Since only one chordal 4-cycle was found, the total number of chordless cycles is [4].
  
Unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <0, 4, 6, 7, 0> with chord (4, 7).
