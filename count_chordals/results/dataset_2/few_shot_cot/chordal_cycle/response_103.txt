Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in this graph:
1. Cycle <0, 9, 4, 8, 0>
2. Cycle <0, 9, 4, 7, 0>
3. Cycle <1, 6, 7, 5, 2, 1>
4. Cycle <2, 5, 7, 8, 2>
5. Cycle <3, 5, 9, 4, 3>
6. Cycle <3, 6, 7, 5, 3>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle <0, 9, 4, 8, 0> has chord (4, 8).
2. Cycle <0, 9, 4, 7, 0> has chord (4, 7).
3. Cycle <1, 6, 7, 5, 2, 1> has chord (7, 5).
4. Cycle <2, 5, 7, 8, 2> has chord (7, 8).
5. Cycle <3, 5, 9, 4, 3> has chord (9, 3).
6. Cycle <3, 6, 7, 5, 3> has chord (7, 3).

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
