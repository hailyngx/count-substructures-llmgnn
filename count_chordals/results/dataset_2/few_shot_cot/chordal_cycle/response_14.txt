Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<0, 14, 17, 16, 10, 11>
<0, 14, 17, 16, 3, 12>
<0, 14, 13, 7, 9, 17>
<0, 14, 13, 5, 18, 2>
<0, 13, 7, 9, 17, 16>
<0, 13, 5, 18, 2, 12>
<1, 7, 9, 17, 16, 10>
<1, 6, 18, 5, 13, 14>
<1, 6, 18, 5, 4, 7>
<2, 18, 5, 13, 14, 17>
<2, 18, 5, 4, 12, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 14, 13, 7, (9, 17), 16>
<0, 13, 5, 18, (2, 12), 3>
<1, 6, 18, 5, (13, 14), 7>
<2, 18, 5, 13, (14, 17), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are [4] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
