Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 7, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 9, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 6, 5, 4, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 9, 6, 5, 2>
- Cycle 4: <2, 9, 3, 4, 2>
- Cycle 5: <4, 6, 5, 2, 4>
- Cycle 6: <6, 9, 2, 4, 6>
- Cycle 7: <6, 5, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 8: <8, 4, 3, 9, 8>
- Cycle 9: <9, 2, 0, 6, 9>

Step 2: 
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <6, 2>
- Cycle 2 has a chord <6, 4>
- Cycle 3 has a chord <9, 5>
- Cycle 4 has a chord <9, 4>
- Cycle 5 has a chord <6, 2>
- Cycle 6 has a chord <9, 5>
- Cycle 7 has a chord <6, 4>
- Cycle 8 has a chord <4, 9>
- Cycle 9 has a chord <9, 0>

Step 3: 
Counting chordal 4-cycles:
As there are 9 cycles with exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [9]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
<0, 6, 9, 2, 0>
<1, 6, 5, 4, 1>
<2, 9, 6, 5, 2>
<2, 9, 3, 4, 2>
<4, 6, 5, 2, 4>
<6, 9, 2, 4, 6>
<6, 5, 4, 8, 6>
<8, 4, 3, 9, 8>
<9, 2, 0, 6, 9>
