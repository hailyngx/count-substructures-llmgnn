Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 8, 25, 20, 2, 3> has one chord (1, 28)
- <1, 8, 19, 29, 24, 11> has one chord (8, 6)
- <1, 10, 12, 22, 18, 21> has one chord (10, 1)
- <1, 15, 24, 11, 13, 5> has one chord (24, 9)
- <1, 28, 26, 23, 9, 11> has one chord (28, 1)
- <1, 28, 26, 23, 6, 8> has one chord (28, 14)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 42 cycles and 6 of them have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [36].
