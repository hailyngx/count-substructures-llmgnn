42. Cycle <21, 17, 0, 10>
43. Cycle <21, 17, 16, 1>
44. Cycle <21, 24, 13, 12>

50. Cycle <26, 27, 0, 17>
51. Cycle <28, 7, 15, 22>
52. Cycle <29, 22, 5, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
The chordal 4-cycles are:
1. Chordal cycle <2, 19, 16, 1> with chord (16, 1)
2. Chordal cycle <8, 10, 17, 0> with chord (17, 0)
3. Chordal cycle <5, 3, 1, 16> with chord (1, 16)
4. Chordal cycle <5, 22, 23, 25> with chord (23, 25)
5. Chordal cycle <14, 18, 11, 5> with chord (11, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 52 cycles of length 4 or more.
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles.
Therefore, there are [47] chordless 4-cycles in the graph.
