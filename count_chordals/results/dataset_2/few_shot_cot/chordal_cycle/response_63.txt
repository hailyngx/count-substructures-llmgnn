Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 4, 2, 8, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 4, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 4, 3, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 9, 6, 3, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 4, 7, 9, 1>
- Cycle 6: <0, 6, 4, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 7: <0, 6, 4, 3, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 8: <0, 6, 9, 7, 4, 3, 5, 8, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 7, 4, 2, 8, 1> has chord (2, 8)
- <0, 7, 4, 5, 8, 1> has chord (5, 8)
- <0, 7, 4, 3, 5, 8, 1> has chord (3, 8)
- <0, 7, 9, 6, 3, 5, 8, 1> has chord (9, 5)
- <0, 6, 4, 7, 9, 1> has chord (7, 9)
- <0, 6, 4, 5, 8, 1> has chord (5, 8)
- <0, 6, 4, 3, 5, 8, 1> has chord (3, 8)
- <0, 6, 9, 7, 4, 3, 5, 8, 1> has chord (7, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [0] chordal 4-cycles in the provided graph.
