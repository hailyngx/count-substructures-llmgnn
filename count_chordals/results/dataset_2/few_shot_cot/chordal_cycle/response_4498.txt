Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph. 
One such cycle is: (1, 6, 12, 1)
Another cycle is: (3, 11, 1, 3)
And another cycle is: (5, 12, 13, 5)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle (1, 6, 12, 1) has a single chord (1, 12)
- The cycle (3, 11, 1, 3) has a single chord (3, 1)
- The cycle (5, 12, 13, 5) has a single chord (5, 13)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have found 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, 12, (6, 1)>
<3, 1, (11, 3)>
<5, 13, (12, 5)>
