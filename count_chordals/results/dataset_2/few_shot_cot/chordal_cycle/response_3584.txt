Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- <0, 13, 28, 23, 3>  
- <1, 6, 24, 12, 16>  
- <1, 21, 25, 8, 26>  
- <2, 27, 16, 12, 3>  
- <7, 11, 29, 9, 18>  
- <5, 26, 13, 0, 20>  
- <16, 27, 2, 17, 4>  
- <9, 29, 11, 7, 20>  
- <14, 18, 9, 19, 8>  
- <10, 22, 15, 21, 25>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).  
- <1, 21, 25, 8, 26> has one chord: (1, 25)  
- <7, 11, 29, 9, 18> has one chord: (11, 18)  
- <9, 29, 11, 7, 20> has one chord: (9, 7)  
- <14, 18, 9, 19, 8> has one chord: (14, 9)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
