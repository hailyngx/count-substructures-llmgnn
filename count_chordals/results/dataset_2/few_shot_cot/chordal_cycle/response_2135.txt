Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (9, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 1, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 4, 0, 5, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 2, 5, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 7, 4, 0, 5, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 1, 7, 4, 0, 6, 3>
- Cycle 8: <4, 0, 7, 9, 4>
- Cycle 9: <5, 1, 7, 4, 0, 6, 5>
- Cycle 10: <6, 3, 1, 7, 4, 6>

Step 2: 
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 1, 0> (Chord: (4, 1))
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 1, 7, 4, 0> (Chord: (5, 7))
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 4, 0, 5, 1> (Chord: (7, 5))
- Cycle 6: <2, 7, 4, 0, 5, 2> (Chord: (7, 5))
- Cycle 9: <5, 1, 7, 4, 0, 6, 5> (Chord: (1, 6))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
- There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found. 

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
