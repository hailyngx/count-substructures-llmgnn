Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 3, 1, 6>
- Cycle 2: <0, 14, 3, 7, 11>
- Cycle 3: <0, 14, 2, 5, 12>
- Cycle 4: <0, 13, 12, 8, 7>
- Cycle 5: <1, 2, 5, 13, 12>
- Cycle 6: <1, 2, 8, 7, 3>
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 4, 13, 11>
- Cycle 8: <3, 7, 11, 13, 4>
- Cycle 9: <3, 14, 0, 13, 5>
- Cycle 10: <4, 13, 5, 2, 8>
- Cycle 11: <4, 10, 0, 14, 2>
- Cycle 12: <5, 10, 0, 13, 4>
- Cycle 13: <5, 12, 8, 2, 1>
- Cycle 14: <6, 1, 3, 7, 10>
- Cycle 15: <8, 2, 1, 3, 9>
- Cycle 16: <8, 9, 3, 11, 13>
- Cycle 17: <8, 12, 5, 13, 4>

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 2 has chord (3, 7)
- Cycle 3 has chord (5, 12)
- Cycle 4 has chord (8, 12)
- Cycle 5 has chord (5, 13)
- Cycle 6 has chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 7 has chord (6, 13)
- Cycle 8 has chord (7, 13)
- Cycle 9 has chord (13, 0)
- Cycle 10 has chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 11 has chord (0, 14)
- Cycle 12 has chord (0, 13)
- Cycle 13 has chord (2, 1)
- Cycle 14 has chord (3, 7)
- Cycle 15 has chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 16 has chord (3, 11)
- Cycle 17 has chord (5, 13)

Finally, we count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [10].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, 14, 3, 1>
- <1, 2, 5, 13>
- <1, 6, 4, 13>
- <3, 7, 11, 13>
- <3, 14, 0, 13>
- <4, 10, 0, 14>
- <5, 12, 8, 2>
- <6, 1, 3, 7>
- <8, 9, 3, 11>
- <8, 12, 5, 13>
