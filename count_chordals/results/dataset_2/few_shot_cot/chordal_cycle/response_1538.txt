Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 7, 10, 1, 5, 11>
- Cycle 2: <0, 11, 7, 10, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 11, 7, 6, 1, 5, 11>
- Cycle 4: <0, 11, 7, 9, 14, 8, 4, 12, 14, 5, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 11, 13, 5, 1, 2, 8, 14, 5, 11>
- Cycle 6: <0, 11, 13, 5, 14, 8, 2, 7, 6, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 11, 13, 2, 7, 10, 1, 5, 14, 0>
- Cycle 8: <0, 14, 8, 2, 7, 11, 13, 5, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 9: <0, 14, 12, 4, 8, 2, 7, 11, 13, 5, 11>
- Cycle 10: <1, 10, 11, 7, 6, 0, 5, 13, 11>
- Cycle 11: <1, 10, 7, 11, 5, 13, 2, 8, 14, 0, 6, 1>
- Cycle 12: <1, 2, 8, 14, 5, 11, 13, 2, 9, 14, 12, 4, 3, 0, 6, 1>
- Cycle 13: <2, 7, 11, 13, 5, 14, 12, 4, 8, 2>
- Cycle 14: <4, 12, 14, 8, 2, 7, 6, 0, 5, 1>
- Cycle 15: <5, 11, 13, 5>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 11, 7, 9, 14, 8, 4, 12, 14, 5, 0> has a chord (7, 14)
- <0, 11, 13, 5, 1, 2, 8, 14, 5, 11> has a chord (1, 8)
- <0, 14, 8, 2, 7, 11, 13, 5, 1, 6, 0> has a chord (1, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 15 cycles in total, and 3 of them have chords. So, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [12].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 11, 7, 9>
- <1, 10, 7, 11>
- <1, 2, 8, 14>
