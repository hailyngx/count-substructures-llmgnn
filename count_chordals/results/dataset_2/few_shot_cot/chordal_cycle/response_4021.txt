Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 8, 4>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 5, 2>
- Cycle 3: <1, 5, 2, 6>
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, 6, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 0, 6, 5>
- Cycle 6: <3, 1, 4, 5>
- Cycle 7: <3, 8, 4, 9>
- Cycle 8: <3, 7, 6, 8>
- Cycle 9: <4, 1, 5, 2>
- Cycle 10: <4, 8, 9, 7>
- Cycle 11: <5, 1, 4, 8>
- Cycle 12: <5, 4, 8, 9>
- Cycle 13: <5, 2, 6, 7>
- Cycle 14: <5, 7, 6, 8>
- Cycle 15: <6, 8, 4, 5>
- Cycle 16: <6, 7, 9, 4>
- Cycle 17: <6, 2, 5, 1>
- Cycle 18: <6, 0, 1, 4>
- Cycle 19: <0, 1, 5, 4>
- Cycle 20: <0, 5, 7, 9>
- Cycle 21: <0, 6, 8, 3>
- Cycle 22: <2, 1, 5, 7>
- Cycle 23: <2, 5, 7, 9>
- Cycle 24: <2, 6, 8, 4>
- Cycle 25: <2, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle 26: <7, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle 27: <7, 5, 4, 8>
- Cycle 28: <7, 6, 8, 9>
- Cycle 29: <9, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 30: <9, 8, 6, 2>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 5, 2> has chord (4, 2)
- Cycle 10: <4, 8, 9, 7> has chord (8, 7)
- Cycle 13: <5, 2, 6, 7> has chord (2, 6)
- Cycle 16: <6, 7, 9, 4> has chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 26: <7, 3, 1, 4> has chord (3, 1)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have a total of [25] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
