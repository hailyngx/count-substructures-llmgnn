Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 27, 21, 7>
- Cycle 2: <9, 6, 2, 27>
- Cycle 3: <3, 25, 18, 26>
- Cycle 4: <25, 13, 4, 17>
- Cycle 5: <26, 22, 11, 15>
- Cycle 6: <24, 3, 25, 10>
- Cycle 7: <1, 24, 26, 5>
- Cycle 8: <17, 8, 6, 20>
- Cycle 9: <18, 25, 10, 1>
- Cycle 10: <11, 22, 26, 5>
- Cycle 11: <7, 21, 27, 0>
- Cycle 12: <12, 24, 3, 29>
- Cycle 13: <6, 9, 28, 0>
- Cycle 14: <3, 29, 5, 26>
- Cycle 15: <15, 11, 19, 12>
- Cycle 16: <26, 5, 29, 7>
- Cycle 17: <22, 11, 15, 19>
- Cycle 18: <27, 21, 7, 23>
- Cycle 19: <2, 6, 8, 20>
- Cycle 20: <9, 28, 0, 2>
- Cycle 21: <25, 10, 4, 13>
- Cycle 22: <24, 12, 19, 15>
- Cycle 23: <26, 18, 25, 13>
- Cycle 24: <6, 15, 11, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6, 9, 28, 0>, Chord: (6, 28)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, 15, 11, 19>, Chord: (15, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, 6, 8, 20>, Chord: (8, 20)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <24, 3, 25, 10>, Chord: (3, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 20 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
