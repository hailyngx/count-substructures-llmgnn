Response:
First, let's identify all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle: <0, 7, 5, 1, 9>
2. Cycle: <0, 7, 5, 10, 12>
3. Cycle: <0, 7, 5, 8, 15>
4. Cycle: <0, 7, 15, 11, 9>
5. Cycle: <3, 0, 7, 5, 1>
6. Cycle: <3, 16, 9, 1, 19>
7. Cycle: <3, 16, 9, 11, 5>
8. Cycle: <4, 17, 14, 2, 9>
9. Cycle: <4, 17, 14, 12, 10>
10. Cycle: <4, 17, 14, 19, 1>
11. Cycle: <4, 17, 18, 13, 6>
12. Cycle: <5, 1, 19, 14, 17>
13. Cycle: <5, 7, 15, 11, 9>
14. Cycle: <5, 8, 19, 14, 17>
15. Cycle: <7, 0, 3, 16, 9>
16. Cycle: <8, 5, 11, 15, 4>
17. Cycle: <13, 18, 17, 14, 12>
18. Cycle: <13, 18, 17, 4, 19>
19. Cycle: <13, 18, 17, 6, 7>
20. Cycle: <13, 18, 17, 4, 15>

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 7, 5, 1, 9> has chord (5, 1)
- Cycle <0, 7, 5, 8, 15> has chord (5, 8)
- Cycle <3, 16, 9, 11, 5> has chord (9, 11)
- Cycle <4, 17, 14, 2, 9> has chord (14, 9)
- Cycle <4, 17, 14, 12, 10> has chord (14, 10)
- Cycle <5, 8, 19, 14, 17> has chord (8, 14)
- Cycle <13, 18, 17, 14, 12> has chord (17, 14)

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles is [6]. The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 7, 5, 1>,<(5, 1)>
<0, 7, 5, 8, 15>,<(5, 8)>
<3, 16, 9, 11, 5>,<(9, 11)>
<4, 17, 14, 2, 9>,<(14, 9)>
<4, 17, 14, 12, 10>,<(14, 10)>
<5, 8, 19, 14, 17>,<(8, 14)>
