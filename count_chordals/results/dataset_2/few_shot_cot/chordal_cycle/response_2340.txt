Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:  
1. Cycle 1-5-9-7-1  
   Chords: (5, 7)  
2. Cycle 1-5-9-6-1  
   Chords: (5, 6)  
3. Cycle 1-5-2-4-7  
   Chords: (5, 4)  
4. Cycle 1-5-2-3-8  
   Chords: (5, 8)  

Step 2:  
Out of the cycles listed above, all of them have exactly one chord.  

Step 3:  
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.  

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].  

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:   
<1, 5, 9, 7>  
<1, 5, 9, 6>  
<1, 5, 2, 4>  
<1, 5, 2, 3>
