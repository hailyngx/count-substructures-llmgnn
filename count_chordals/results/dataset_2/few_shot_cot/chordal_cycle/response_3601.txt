Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <0, (5, 20), 24, 26>.

Here is the step-by-step process of finding it:
1. List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
   - Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 29 - 4
   - Cycle 2: 0 - 4 - 18 - 16
   - Cycle 3: 0 - 4 - 14 - 12
   - Cycle 4: 0 - 21 - 15 - 20
   - Cycle 5: 0 - 21 - 27 - 22
   - Cycle 6: 0 - 21 - 27 - 6
   - Cycle 7: 0 - 1 - 6 - 2
   - Cycle 8: 0 - 1 - 9 - 11
   - Cycle 9: 1 - 6 - 27 - 21
   - Cycle 10: 1 - 6 - 12 - 17
   - Cycle 11: 2 - 6 - 27 - 21
   - Cycle 12: 2 - 19 - 26 - 24
   - Cycle 13: 2 - 19 - 26 - 20
   - Cycle 14: 2 - 19 - 27 - 21
   - Cycle 15: 3 - 8 - 27 - 21
   - Cycle 16: 3 - 8 - 16 - 22
   - Cycle 17: 4 - 10 - 29 - 4
   - Cycle 18: 4 - 10 - 18 - 16
   - Cycle 19: 4 - 0 - 21 - 15
   - Cycle 20: 5 - 3 - 8 - 27
   - Cycle 21: 5 - 14 - 12 - 17
   - Cycle 22: 5 - 14 - 0 - 21
   - Cycle 23: 6 - 12 - 17 - 23
   - Cycle 24: 6 - 12 - 16 - 22
   - Cycle 25: 7 - 22 - 16 - 18
   - Cycle 26: 7 - 25 - 23 - 17
   - Cycle 27: 8 - 27 - 21 - 0
   - Cycle 28: 9 - 1 - 0 - 21
   - Cycle 29: 11 - 9 - 1 - 6
   - Cycle 30: 12 - 16 - 22 - 7
   - Cycle 31: 12 - 19 - 26 - 24
   - Cycle 32: 13 - 19 - 26 - 24
   - Cycle 33: 14 - 0 - 4 - 29
   - Cycle 34: 14 - 0 - 4 - 18
   - Cycle 35: 15 - 20 - 24 - 26
   - Cycle 36: 16 - 12 - 17 - 23
   - Cycle 37: 18 - 4 - 10 - 29
   - Cycle 38: 18 - 4 - 0 - 21
   - Cycle 39: 19 - 2 - 6 - 27
   - Cycle 40: 19 - 2 - 20 - 24
   - Cycle 41: 20 - 15 - 21 - 27
   - Cycle 42: 21 - 0 - 1 - 9
   - Cycle 43: 22 - 7 - 25 - 23
   - Cycle 44: 25 - 7 - 16 - 12
   - Cycle 45: 26 - 19 - 13 - 14
   - Cycle 46: 27 - 6 - 1 - 9

2. Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
   - Cycle 35: 15 - 20 - 24 - 26 has only one chord (20, 24), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.

3. Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]
