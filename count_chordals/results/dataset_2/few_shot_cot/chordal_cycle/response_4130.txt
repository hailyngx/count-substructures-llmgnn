Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6-3-1-9-6
- Cycle 2: 6-3-8-4-6
- Cycle 3: 6-2-4-7-5-6
- Cycle 4: 6-2-4-8-3-6
- Cycle 5: 6-0-2-4-8-6
- Cycle 6: 6-0-9-7-5-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 6-3-1-9-6 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 2: 6-3-8-4-6 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 3: 6-2-4-7-5-6 has one chord 7-2.
- Cycle 4: 6-2-4-8-3-6 has one chord 8-3.
- Cycle 5: 6-0-2-4-8-6 has one chord 8-2.
- Cycle 6: 6-0-9-7-5-6 has one chord 9-5.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <6, (7-2), 5>
2. <6, (8-3), 4>
3. <6, (8-2), 0>
