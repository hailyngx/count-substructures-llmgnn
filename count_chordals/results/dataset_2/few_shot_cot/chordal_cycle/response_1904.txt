Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 10) (10, 1) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 11) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 2) (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 5) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 4) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 14) (12, 9) (12, 1) (12, 6) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 14) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 11) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 14, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 11, 10, 12, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 6, 0, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 7, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 12, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 13, 10, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 13, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 8, 13, and node 11
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 10, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 6
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 0, 7, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 5, 9, 8, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 3, 5, 9, 2)
- Cycle 3: (4, 3, 5, 9, 4)
- Cycle 4: (6, 0, 3, 5, 6)
- Cycle 5: (7, 5, 9, 8, 7)
- Cycle 6: (10, 1, 3, 5, 10)
- Cycle 7: (11, 1, 3, 5, 11)
- Cycle 8: (12, 1, 3, 5, 12)
- Cycle 9: (13, 9, 5, 3, 13)
- Cycle 10: (14, 0, 3, 5, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycles with exactly one chord are: Cycle 2, Cycle 4, Cycle 6, Cycle 8, Cycle 9

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 5 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <2, (9, 5), 3>
2. <4, (5, 3), 9>
3. <6, (3, 5), 0>
4. <10, (3, 5), 1>
5. <12, (3, 5), 1>
