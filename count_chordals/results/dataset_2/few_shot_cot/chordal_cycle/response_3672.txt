Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 0

Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
- <0, 5, 2, 7>
- <0, 5, 9, 2>
- <0, 5, 4, 2>
- <0, 5, 4, 8>
- <0, 5, 4, 0>
- <0, 7, 2, 1>
- <0, 7, 1, 9>
- <0, 7, 1, 2>
- <0, 7, 6, 3>
- <0, 7, 6, 0>
- <0, 0, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 8, 9>
- <0, 4, 8, 5>
- <0, 4, 8, 2>

- <0, 2, 5, 9>
- <0, 2, 5, 9>
- <0, 2, 5, 4>
- <0, 2, 5, 9>
- <0, 2, 5, 4>
- <0, 1, 9, 5>
- <0, 1, 9, 8>
- <0, 1, 9, 2>
- <0, 1, 9, 5>
- ... (more cycles)

Step 2:
- <0, 5, 2, 7> (chord 2-7)
- <0, 4, 8, 9> (chord 4-9)
- <0, 7, 2, 1> (chord 2-1)
- <0, 5, 4, 2> (chord 4-2)

Step 3:
Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]
