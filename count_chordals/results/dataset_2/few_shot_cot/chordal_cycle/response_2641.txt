Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<0, 5, 4, 7>
<0, 5, 6, 9>
<0, 5, 8, 7>
<0, 9, 6, 5>
<1, 4, 7, 3>
<1, 4, 5, 0>
<1, 4, 7, 6>
<1, 7, 6, 3>
<1, 7, 4, 0>
<1, 7, 8, 3>
<1, 3, 7, 4>
<1, 3, 6, 5>
<1, 3, 7, 8>
<2, 5, 0, 4>
<2, 5, 8, 3>
<2, 3, 7, 4>
<2, 3, 6, 5>
<3, 7, 8, 5>
<3, 7, 4, 1>
<3, 7, 6, 9>
<4, 5, 0, 9>
<5, 6, 9, 0>
<5, 6, 7, 1>
<6, 7, 8, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

<0, 5, 4, 7> - Chord: (4, 7)
<0, 5, 8, 7> - Chord: (8, 7)
<1, 4, 7, 3> - Chord: (7, 3)
<1, 4, 5, 0> - Chord: (5, 0)
<1, 4, 7, 6> - Chord: (7, 6)
<1, 7, 6, 3> - Chord: (6, 3)
<1, 7, 8, 3> - Chord: (8, 3)
<2, 5, 0, 4> - Chord: (0, 4)
<3, 7, 8, 5> - Chord: (8, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
