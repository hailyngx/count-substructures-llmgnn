Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, 17, 2, 16, 7> has a chord (2, 7)
        - <2, 16, 7, 5, 26> has a chord (7, 26)
        - <10, 12, 9, 3, 25> has a chord (9, 25)
        - <10, 14, 20, 17, 28> has a chord (20, 17)
        - <13, 23, 18, 2, 16> has a chord (18, 16)
        - <19, 1, 17, 21, 6> has a chord (17, 6)
        - <24, 9, 3, 25, 15> has a chord (3, 15)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are [56] chordless cycles.
