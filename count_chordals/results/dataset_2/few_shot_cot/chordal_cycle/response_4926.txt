Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 7, 8, 5, 0>
- <0, 7, 12, 1, 0>
- <0, 7, 8, 14, 0>
- <0, 7, 12, 3, 0>
- <0, 5, 4, 11, 1, 0>
- <0, 5, 10, 3, 12, 1, 0>
- <0, 5, 10, 14, 1, 0>
- <1, 12, 7, 8, 14, 1>
- <1, 12, 3, 0, 5, 10, 14, 1>
- <1, 12, 7, 6, 9, 14, 1>
- <1, 11, 9, 14, 1>
- <2, 6, 9, 11, 4, 2>
- <3, 6, 9, 11, 1, 12, 3>
- <3, 6, 7, 12, 1, 11, 9, 14, 10, 3>
- <3, 6, 7, 8, 5, 10, 14, 9, 11, 4, 2>
- <4, 5, 10, 14, 9, 11, 4>
- <5, 8, 7, 12, 1, 11, 4, 5>
- <6, 9, 11, 1, 12, 7, 8, 5, 10, 13, 6>
- <6, 7, 12, 1, 11, 9, 14, 10, 13, 6>
- <7, 8, 14, 10, 13, 6, 9, 11, 1, 12, 7>
- <5, 4, 11, 9, 14, 8, 7, 6, 13, 10, 5>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 7, 8, 5>
- <0, 7, 12, 1>
- <0, 7, 8, 14>
- <0, 7, 12, 3>
- <0, 5, 4, 11>
- <0, 5, 10, 3>
- <0, 5, 10, 14>
- <1, 12, 7, 8>
- <1, 12, 3, 0>
- <1, 12, 7, 6>
- <1, 11, 9, 14>
- <2, 6, 9, 11>
- <3, 6, 9, 11>
- <3, 6, 7, 12>
- <3, 6, 7, 8>
- <4, 5, 10, 14>
- <5, 8, 7, 12>
- <6, 9, 11, 1>
- <6, 7, 12, 1>
- <7, 8, 14, 10>
- <9, 11, 4, 2>

Step 3:
There are 22 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [22].
