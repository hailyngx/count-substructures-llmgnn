Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <15, 27, 13, 26, 3> with no chord
- <15, 27, 16, 23, 4> with no chord
- <15, 27, 16, 19, 17> with no chord
- <27, 13, 26, 3, 5> with no chord
- <27, 16, 19, 17, 9> with no chord
- <1, 6, 25, 3, 26> with no chord
- <1, 18, 10, 11, 25> with no chord
- <3, 26, 13, 24, 7> with no chord
- <3, 26, 13, 19, 20> with no chord

Step 2:
There are no cycles with exactly one chord.

Step 3:
There are 30 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final number to be put inside brackets is [30].
