Response:
Step 1: 
Based on the given graph, we can identify the following cycles of length 4 or more:
- <1, 5, 7, 9>
- <1, 9, 12, 4>
- <1, 3, 5, 12>
- <1, 3, 13, 4>
- <1, 4, 12, 5>
- <1, 9, 11, 2>
- <3, 0, 13, 4>
- <3, 5, 7, 9>
- <3, 8, 11, 13>
- <4, 2, 11, 9>
- <4, 6, 13, 3>
- <5, 1, 3, 0>
- <5, 7, 13, 4>
- <6, 4, 12, 5>
- <9, 1, 3, 13>
- <9, 2, 11, 8>
- <11, 2, 10, 4>
- <11, 8, 7, 13>

Step 2: 
From the identified cycles, we can check for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, 5, 7, 9> has chord (5, 9)
- <1, 9, 12, 4> has chord (9, 12)
- <1, 3, 13, 4> has chord (3, 13)
- <1, 4, 12, 5> has chord (4, 12)
- <3, 0, 13, 4> has chord (0, 13)
- <4, 2, 11, 9> has chord (2, 11)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord, we have a total of [6] such cycles. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, 5, 7, 9>
- <1, 9, 12, 4>
- <1, 3, 13, 4>
- <1, 4, 12, 5>
- <3, 0, 13, 4>
- <4, 2, 11, 9>
