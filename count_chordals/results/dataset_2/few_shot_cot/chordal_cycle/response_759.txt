Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 6, 3, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 1, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 2, 4, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 4, 8, 9, 2>
- Cycle 7: <2, 5, 7, 6, 3, 2>
- Cycle 8: <3, 6, 9, 8, 4, 3>
- Cycle 9: <4, 1, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle 10: <5, 6, 9, 7, 5>
  
Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 9, 6, 5, 2, 0> has a chord (6, 2)
- <0, 9, 6, 3, 4, 0> has a chord (9, 4)
- <0, 4, 1, 5, 7, 0> has a chord (4, 5)
- <0, 7, 5, 2, 0> has a chord (7, 2)
- <1, 5, 2, 4, 1> has a chord (5, 4)
- <2, 4, 8, 9, 2> has a chord (4, 9)
- <2, 5, 7, 6, 3, 2> has a chord (5, 3)
- <3, 6, 9, 8, 4, 3> has a chord (6, 8)
- <4, 1, 5, 7, 4> has a chord (1, 7)
- <5, 6, 9, 7, 5> has a chord (6, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 10 cycles with exactly one chord, so the number of chordal 4-cycles is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 9, 6, 5, 2, 0>, (6, 2)
<0, 9, 6, 3, 4, 0>, (9, 4)
<0, 4, 1, 5, 7, 0>, (4, 5)
<0, 7, 5, 2, 0>, (7, 2)
<1, 5, 2, 4, 1>, (5, 4)
<2, 4, 8, 9, 2>, (4, 9)
<2, 5, 7, 6, 3, 2>, (5, 3)
<3, 6, 9, 8, 4, 3>, (6, 8)
<4, 1, 5, 7, 4>, (1, 7)
<5, 6, 9, 7, 5>, (6, 7)
