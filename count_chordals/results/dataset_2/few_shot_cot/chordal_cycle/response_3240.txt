Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <5, 9, 7, 4>
2. <5, 9, 6, 4>
3. <5, 9, 8, 4>
4. <5, 9, 7, 10>
5. <5, 9, 3, 10>
6. <5, 11, 2, 7>
7. <5, 11, 13, 6>
8. <5, 11, 12, 8>
9. <5, 11, 3, 10>
10. <9, 7, 4, 8>
11. <9, 7, 10, 3>
12. <9, 6, 4, 8>
13. <9, 6, 1, 14>
14. <9, 6, 11, 13>
15. <9, 6, 11, 3>
16. <9, 8, 12, 14>
17. <4, 7, 10, 3>
18. <4, 6, 1, 14>
19. <4, 6, 11, 13>
20. <4, 6, 11, 3>
21. <7, 10, 3, 9>
22. <6, 1, 14, 12>
23. <6, 11, 13, 12>
24. <8, 12, 14, 9>
25. <2, 7, 10, 3>
26. <11, 13, 12, 5>
27. <11, 12, 14, 9>
28. <13, 12, 14, 9>
29. <1, 14, 12, 5>

Step 2:
There are no cycles with exactly one chord in the graph.

Step 3:
There are a total of [29] unique chordless 4-cycles in the graph.
