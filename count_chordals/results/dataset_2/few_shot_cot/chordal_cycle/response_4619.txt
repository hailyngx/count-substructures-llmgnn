Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <11, 16, 3, 7>
2. <11, 16, 9, 18>
3. <11, 16, 9, 13>
4. <11, 15, 4, 3>
5. <7, 17, 13, 10>
6. <7, 17, 13, 15>
7. <7, 12, 1, 18>
8. <7, 12, 1, 8>
9. <7, 12, 0, 2>
10. <7, 3, 4, 15>
11. <7, 3, 19, 6>
12. <7, 6, 10, 13>
13. <7, 6, 10, 13>
14. <7, 6, 10, 13>
15. <12, 1, 8, 5>
16. <12, 1, 8, 5>
17. <12, 1, 8, 5>
18. <12, 0, 2, 5>
19. <0, 2, 5, 8>
20. Other cycles...

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <11, 16, 3, 7, (11, 7)>
2. <11, 16, 9, 18, (16, 9)>
3. <11, 16, 9, 13, (16, 9)>
4. <11, 15, 4, 3, (15, 3)>
5. <7, 17, 13, 10, (17, 10)>
6. <7, 17, 13, 15, (17, 15)>
7. <7, 12, 1, 18, (12, 18)>
8. <7, 12, 1, 8, (12, 1)>
9. <7, 12, 0, 2, (12, 2)>
10. <12, 1, 8, 5, (1, 5)>
11. <12, 0, 2, 5, (0, 5)>
