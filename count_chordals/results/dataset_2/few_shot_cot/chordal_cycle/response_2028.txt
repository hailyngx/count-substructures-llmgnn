Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 2, 8, 6, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 2, 4, 6, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 2, 5, 9, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 6, 2, 5, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 6, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 8: (2, 5, 9, 7, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 5, 1, 6, 2)
- Cycle 10: (2, 5, 9, 4, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 6, 1, 7, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 6, 4, 9, 2)

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: <1, (9, 4), 5>
- Cycle 2: <1, (2, 6), 5>
- Cycle 5: <1, (5, 9), 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, (5, 1), 6>
- Cycle 11: <2, (1, 7), 6>

Since there are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [5].
