Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 8, 2, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 8, 4, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 9, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 8, 4, 1, 6, 3, 7, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 8, 4, 7, 3, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 0, 3, 6, 1, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 0, 3, 7, 4, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 0, 4, 7, 3, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 0, 4, 1, 6, 3, 7, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, 0, 5)
- Cycle 11: (5, 7, 3, 6, 1, 4, 0, 5)

- Cycle 13: (9, 8, 5, 7, 4, 1, 2, 9)
- Cycle 14: (9, 8, 5, 0, 3, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 15: (9, 8, 4, 0, 3, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 16: (9, 8, 4, 1, 6, 3, 0, 9)
- Cycle 17: (9, 4, 0, 3, 6, 1, 2, 9)
- Cycle 18: (9, 4, 1, 2, 0, 3, 7, 9)
- Cycle 19: (9, 4, 7, 3, 0, 5, 8, 9)
- Cycle 20: (4, 7, 3, 0, 5, 8, 9, 4)
- Cycle 21: (3, 7, 4, 9, 8, 5, 0, 3)
- Cycle 22: (3, 7, 4, 1, 2, 0, 5, 3)
- Cycle 23: (3, 7, 5, 0, 4, 9, 8, 3)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 4: (5, 8, 4, 9, 5) has a chord (8, 9)
- Cycle 7: (5, 0, 3, 7, 4, 1, 6, 5) has a chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 9: (5, 0, 4, 1, 6, 3, 7, 5) has a chord (4, 6)
- Cycle 10: (5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, 0, 5) has a chord (4, 6)
- Cycle 13: (9, 8, 5, 7, 4, 1, 2, 9) has a chord (7, 1)
- Cycle 18: (9, 4, 1, 2, 0, 3, 7, 9) has a chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 19: (9, 4, 7, 3, 0, 5, 8, 9) has a chord (7, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<5, 8, 4, 9>, chord: (8, 9) 
<5, 0, 3, 7, 4, 1, 6>, chord: (1, 7) 
<5, 0, 4, 1, 6, 3, 7>, chord: (4, 6) 
<5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3, 0>, chord: (4, 6) 
<9, 8, 5, 7, 4, 1, 2>, chord: (7, 1) 
<9, 4, 1, 2, 0, 3, 7>, chord: (1, 7) 
<9, 4, 7, 3, 0, 5, 8>, chord: (7, 5)
