Step 2:

Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 1, 4, 15> with chord (1, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 13, 18, 0> with chord (13, 18)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 12, 8, 7> with chord (12, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, 12, 3, 16> with chord (12, 3)


Step 3:

Final count of chordless cycles: [60 - 4 = 56]

Therefore, the final answer is [56].
