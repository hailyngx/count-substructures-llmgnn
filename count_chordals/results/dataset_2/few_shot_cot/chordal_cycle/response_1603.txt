Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (4, 8, 0, 5, 4)
- (4, 9, 11, 0, 4)
- (4, 9, 12, 11, 6, 4)
- (4, 10, 3, 14, 6, 4)
- (8, 0, 3, 14, 6, 7, 8)
- (0, 9, 11, 6, 4, 13, 0)
- (3, 11, 9, 4, 13, 14, 3)
- (6, 4, 13, 14, 3, 11, 6)
- (7, 6, 4, 13, 14, 10, 7)
- (11, 3, 14, 6, 7, 1, 13, 11)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle (4, 9, 11, 0, 4) has a chord (9, 11)
- Cycle (4, 9, 12, 11, 6, 4) has a chord (9, 6)
- Cycle (3, 11, 9, 4, 13, 14, 3) has a chord (11, 13)
- Cycle (6, 4, 13, 14, 3, 11, 6) has a chord (4, 14)
- Cycle (11, 3, 14, 6, 7, 1, 13, 11) has a chord (3, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 7 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, 8, 0, 5, (8, 5)>
- <4, 9, 11, 0, (9, 11)>
- <4, 9, 12, 11, 6, (9, 6)>
- <4, 10, 3, 14, 6, (10, 3)>
- <8, 0, 3, 14, 6, 7, (8, 7)>
- <0, 9, 11, 6, 4, 13, (9, 13, 4)>
- <6, 4, 13, 14, 3, 11, (4, 14, 11, 13, 3, 6)>
