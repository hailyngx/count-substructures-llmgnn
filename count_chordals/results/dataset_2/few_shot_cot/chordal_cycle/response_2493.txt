Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chorded Cycle 1: <0, 29, 24, 17, 21> (Chord: (24, 17))
- Chorded Cycle 2: <13, 20, 25, 7, 11> (Chord: (20, 25))
- Chorded Cycle 3: <7, 11, 29, 0, 23> (Chord: (29, 0))
- Chorded Cycle 4: <1, 3, 26, 16, 18> (Chord: (3, 26))
- Chorded Cycle 5: <19, 23, 13, 20, 25> (Chord: (13, 20))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [27]
