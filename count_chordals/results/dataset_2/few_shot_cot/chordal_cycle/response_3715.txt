Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 8, 5, 2>
2. <0, 1, 3, 5, 2>
3. <0, 1, 3, 6, 2>
4. <0, 1, 3, 5, 8>
5. <0, 1, 8, 6, 2>
6. <0, 1, 8, 7, 5>
7. <0, 1, 3, 6, 8>
8. <0, 1, 8, 7, 4>
9. <0, 3, 5, 7, 4>
10. <0, 2, 5, 7, 4>
11. <1, 3, 6, 2, 9>
12. <1, 3, 5, 8, 6>
13. <1, 3, 6, 8, 7>
14. <1, 8, 6, 2, 9>
15. <1, 8, 7, 5, 3>
16. <1, 8, 7, 4, 5>
17. <3, 5, 7, 4, 1>
18. <3, 5, 7, 8, 6>
19. <6, 8, 7, 5, 3>
20. <8, 7, 5, 2, 9>

Step 2:

The cycles with exactly one chord (4-cycle) are:
1. <0, 1, 8, 5> with chord (0, 2)
2. <0, 1, 3, 5> with chord (1, 8)
3. <0, 1, 8, 6> with chord (1, 3)
4. <0, 1, 8, 7> with chord (1, 3)
5. <1, 3, 6, 2> with chord (1, 8)
6. <1, 8, 7, 5> with chord (3, 6)
7. <3, 5, 7, 4> with chord (3, 1)
8. <6, 8, 7, 5> with chord (6, 2)

Step 3:

The total number of chordal 4-cycles found is [8].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, 1, 8, 5> with chord (0, 2)
2. <0, 1, 3, 5> with chord (1, 8)
3. <0, 1, 8, 6> with chord (1, 3)
4. <0, 1, 8, 7> with chord (1, 3)
5. <1, 3, 6, 2> with chord (1, 8)
6. <1, 8, 7, 5> with chord (3, 6)
7. <3, 5, 7, 4> with chord (3, 1)
8. <6, 8, 7, 5> with chord (6, 2)
