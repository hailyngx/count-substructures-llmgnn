Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows: 
1. <0, 6, 5, 10> 
2. <0, 8, 1, 10> 
3. <0, 8, 12, 4> 
4. <5, 10, 1, 7> 
5. <2, 11, 10, 7> 
6. <2, 12, 4, 6> 
7. <2, 12, 8, 1> 
8. <3, 14, 11, 2> 
9. <3, 14, 5, 10> 
10. <3, 13, 12, 4> 
11. <4, 6, 5, 10> 
12. <4, 6, 0, 8> 
13. <4, 12, 8, 1> 
14. <5, 14, 11, 2> 
15. <6, 5, 0, 8> 
16. <10, 11, 2, 12> 
17. <10, 11, 14, 6> 
18. <10, 13, 12, 4> 
19. <11, 14, 3, 13> 
20. <14, 6, 4, 12> 

Step 2: 
Checking each of these cycles for exactly one chord:
- <0, 6, 5, 10> has chord (5, 10)
- <0, 8, 1, 10> has chord (1, 10)
- <0, 8, 12, 4> has chord (4, 8)
- <5, 10, 1, 7> has chord (1, 7)
- <2, 11, 10, 7> has chord (10, 7)
- <2, 12, 4, 6> has chord (4, 6)
- <2, 12, 8, 1> has chord (8, 1)
- <3, 14, 11, 2> has chord (11, 2)
- <3, 14, 5, 10> has chord (5, 10)
- <3, 13, 12, 4> has chord (13, 12)
- <4, 6, 5, 10> has chord (5, 10)
- <4, 6, 0, 8> has chord (0, 8)
- <4, 12, 8, 1> has chord (8, 1)
- <5, 14, 11, 2> has chord (11, 2)
- <6, 5, 0, 8> has chord (0, 8)
- <10, 11, 2, 12> has chord (2, 12)
- <10, 11, 14, 6> has chord (11, 14)
- <10, 13, 12, 4> has chord (13, 12)
- <11, 14, 3, 13> has chord (3, 13)
- <14, 6, 4, 12> has chord (6, 12)

Step 3:
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are: 
- <0, 6, 5, 10>, chord (5, 10)
- <0, 8, 1, 10>, chord (1, 10)
- <0, 8, 12, 4>, chord (4, 8)
- <5, 10, 1, 7>, chord (1, 7)
- <2, 12, 4, 6>, chord (4, 6)
- <3, 13, 12, 4>, chord (13, 12)
- <11, 14, 3, 13>, chord (3, 13)

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [14].
