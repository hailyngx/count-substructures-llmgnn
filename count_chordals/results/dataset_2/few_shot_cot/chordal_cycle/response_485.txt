Response:
Step 1: 
- We can identify cycles of length 4 or more: 
  - <0, 5, 13, 1>
  - <0, 18, 13, 1>
  - <0, 5, 8, 10>
  - <1, 13, 16, 14>
  - <1, 15, 11, 4>
  - <2, 5, 8, 10>
  - <3, 8, 10, 4>
  - <3, 14, 16, 13>
  - <4, 10, 8, 5>
  - <4, 11, 15, 1>
  - <5, 8, 10, 15>
  - <8, 9, 17, 1>
  - <8, 10, 15, 1>
  - <10, 8, 9, 17>
  - <13, 16, 14, 3>
  - <14, 16, 13, 1>
  
Step 2:
- We can see that only the cycle <1, 15, 11, 4> has exactly one chord, which is the edge (4, 15).
  
Step 3:
- Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [1].
- The unique chordal 4-cycle is <1, 15, 11, 4>.
