Node 14 is connected to node 4, 0, 8, 9, 2, and node 10

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, 3, 4, 14>. 

Let's count the number of chordless cycles in the graph:
Since the 4-cycle <0, 3, 4, 14> contains one chord, it is not a chordless cycle. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles in the graph is [0].
