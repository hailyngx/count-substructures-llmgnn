Response:
Step 1:

Cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: <3, 6, 0, 10, 13>
- Cycle 2: <4, 5, 3, 8, 4>
- Cycle 3: <5, 10, 6, 7, 5>
- Cycle 4: <7, 11, 6, 10, 13>
- Cycle 5: <8, 2, 14, 1, 9>
- Cycle 6: <9, 14, 7, 8, 4>

Step 2:

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, 6, 0, 10, 13> (chord: (6, 10))

Step 3:

Total number of chordless cycles: [5]
