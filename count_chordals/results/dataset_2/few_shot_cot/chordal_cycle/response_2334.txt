Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 16, 12, 3, 18, 9>
- Cycle 2: <1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 10>
- Cycle 3: <5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 15>
- Cycle 4: <6, 7, 11, 16, 12, 3>
- Cycle 5: <8, 11, 7, 6, 2, 19>
- Cycle 6: <9, 0, 16, 11, 13, 4>
- Cycle 7: <13, 11, 7, 6, 5, 15>
- Cycle 8: <14, 18, 3, 12, 16, 11>
- Cycle 9: <15, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13>
- Cycle 10: <16, 11, 7, 6, 5, 17>
- Cycle 11: <17, 5, 6, 7, 11, 8>
- Cycle 12: <18, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13>
- Cycle 13: <19, 2, 6, 5, 18, 9>
- Cycle 14: <0, 15, 13, 11, 7, 6, 2>
- Cycle 15: <0, 17, 8, 11, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 16: <4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 15>
- Cycle 17: <9, 18, 14, 8, 11, 7, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 16, 11, 7, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 6, 7, 11, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, 7, 11, 13, 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, 11, 13, 15, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, 18, 14, 8, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [12]
