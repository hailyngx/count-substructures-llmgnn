Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 6, (16, 11), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 19, (14, 18), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 2, (12, 17), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (7, 4), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 17, (13, 16), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (10, 15), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 12, (17, 11), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (7, 6), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <8, 16, (13, 17), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <14, 0, (2, 12), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <16, (18, 14), 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <17, (13, 3), 7>
  
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are [27] chordless 4-cycles in the graph.
