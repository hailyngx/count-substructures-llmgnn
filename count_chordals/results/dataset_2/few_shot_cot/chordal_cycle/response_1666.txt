Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
1. <0, 4, 1, 10, 5, 3>
2. <0, 4, 1, 10, 11, 7>
3. <0, 4, 14, 9, 5, 3>
4. <6, 7, 11, 5, 3>
5. <6, 7, 11, 10, 1>
6. <6, 7, 11, 8, 4>
7. <6, 7, 14, 9, 5>
8. <14, 9, 5, 3, 13>
  
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Among the listed cycles, only cycle <0, 4, 1, 10, 5, 3> has exactly one chord which is (4, 5). So, this is a chordal 4-cycle.
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
The final number of chordal 4-cycles is [1]. The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 4, 1, 10, 5, 3> with chord (4, 5).
