Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 14) (4, 11) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 1) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 0) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (13, 12) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 6) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 0) (0, 2) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 6) (10, 2) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 1) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 14) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 11) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 9) (1, 7) (1, 12) (1, 10) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 0)

Node 3 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 14, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 11, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 13, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 12, 3, 11, 14, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 13, 3, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 2, 5, 0, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 5, and node 14
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 13, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 12, 9, 14, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 7, 13, and node 11

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <0, 2, 8, 4, 9, 0>
2. <0, 2, 11, 4, 9, 0>
3. <0, 6, 13, 12, 7, 1, 10, 0>
4. <1, 7, 12, 13, 9, 4, 8, 5, 11, 2, 10, 1>
5. <3, 8, 4, 9, 13, 12, 7, 11, 5, 10, 0, 6, 13, 9, 3>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (and thus forming a chordal 4-cycle) are:
1. <0, 2, 8, 4, 9, 0> with chord (4,9)
2. <0, 2, 11, 4, 9, 0> with chord (4,9)
3. <0, 6, 13, 12, 7, 1, 10, 0> with chord (7,10)
4. <1, 7, 12, 13, 9, 4, 8, 5, 11, 2, 10, 1> with chord (2,9)
5. <3, 8, 4, 9, 13, 12, 7, 11, 5, 10, 0, 6, 13, 9, 3> with chord (9,13)

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [5].
