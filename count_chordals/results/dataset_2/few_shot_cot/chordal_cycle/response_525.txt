Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <5, 2, 4, 9>.

The number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
