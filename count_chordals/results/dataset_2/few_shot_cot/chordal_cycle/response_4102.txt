Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 26, 27, 4, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <3, 9, 26, 27, 4, 24, 29>
- Cycle 3: <10, 7, 2, 5, 0, 19, 11>
- Cycle 4: <12, 25, 17, 29, 24, 4, 6>
- Cycle 5: <15, 13, 3, 9, 26, 11, 19>
- Cycle 6: <16, 15, 10, 7, 14, 20, 23>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has chord (6, 5)
- Cycle 2 has chord (26, 29)
- Cycle 3 has chord (7, 0)
- Cycle 4 has chord (24, 17)
- Cycle 5 has chord (13, 9)
- Cycle 6 has chord (15, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Since all cycles have exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
