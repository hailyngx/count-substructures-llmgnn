Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 7, 13>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 13>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 13, 8>
- Cycle 4: <1, 8, 13, 2>
- Cycle 5: <2, 7, 13, 8>
- Cycle 6: <2, 7, 13, 5>
- Cycle 7: <3, 5, 7, 13>
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 8, 13>
- Cycle 9: <3, 6, 2, 13>
- Cycle 10: <3, 6, 11, 5>
- Cycle 11: <3, 6, 11, 14>
- Cycle 12: <3, 10, 9, 14>
- Cycle 13: <4, 10, 9, 14>
- Cycle 14: <5, 7, 13, 8>
- Cycle 15: <5, 7, 13, 2>
- Cycle 16: <6, 3, 10, 9>
- Cycle 17: <6, 11, 14, 9>
- Cycle 18: <7, 13, 8, 12>
- Cycle 19: <9, 7, 13, 8>
- Cycle 20: <10, 3, 5, 8>
- Cycle 21: <10, 3, 6, 11>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 7, 13> has chord (5, 13)
- <2, 7, 13, 5> has chord (7, 5)
- <3, 5, 7, 13> has chord (5, 13)
- <3, 6, 11, 5> has chord (6, 11)
- <3, 6, 11, 14> has chord (6, 11)
- <3, 10, 9, 14> has chord (10, 14)
- <4, 10, 9, 14> has chord (10, 9)
- <6, 11, 14, 9> has chord (11, 9)
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which are:
[13]

Therefore, the final count of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is 13.
