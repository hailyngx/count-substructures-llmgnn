Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 

List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 9, 2>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 6, 4, 2>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 6, 3, 4>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 7, 3, 4>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 6, 4, 2>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 6, 3, 2>
- Cycle 7: <2, 9, 1, 5, 6>
- Cycle 8: <2, 9, 7, 3, 4>
- Cycle 9: <3, 7, 8, 4, 2>
- Cycle 10: <4, 8, 7, 3, 6>
- Cycle 11: <5, 6, 4, 3, 2>
- Cycle 12: <5, 6, 3, 4, 2>
- Cycle 13: <6, 5, 1, 9, 2>
- Cycle 14: <7, 9, 0, 6, 5>
- Cycle 15: <8, 4, 6, 5, 0>

Step 2:

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, (2, 4), 5>
- <0, (3, 6), 5>
- <2, (1, 3), 9>
- <3, (7, 8), 4>
- <4, (6, 5), 2>

Step 3:

There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [5].
