Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 5, 2, 12> forms a cycle
- <0, 5, 4, 3> forms a cycle
- <0, 5, 9, 4> forms a cycle
- <0, 5, 9, 10> forms a cycle
- <1, 10, 9, 5> forms a cycle
- <1, 10, 11, 6> forms a cycle
- <1, 10, 11, 8> forms a cycle
- <1, 13, 0, 3> forms a cycle
- <1, 13, 12, 9> forms a cycle
- <2, 5, 9, 14> forms a cycle
- <2, 5, 4, 6> forms a cycle
- <2, 7, 8, 11> forms a cycle
- <2, 7, 3, 0> forms a cycle
- <2, 12, 3, 4> forms a cycle
- <2, 12, 13, 1> forms a cycle
- <3, 7, 8, 11> forms a cycle
- <3, 7, 2, 0> forms a cycle
- <3, 7, 8, 11> forms a cycle
- <3, 9, 14, 6> forms a cycle
- <4, 5, 2, 7> forms a cycle
- <4, 5, 9, 10> forms a cycle
- <4, 5, 0, 13> forms a cycle
- <4, 5, 0, 3> forms a cycle
- <4, 6, 11, 8> forms a cycle
- <6, 11, 8, 7> forms a cycle
- <6, 14, 9, 5> forms a cycle
- <7, 2, 0, 13> forms a cycle
- <7, 3, 0, 13> forms a cycle
- <8, 11, 10, 1> forms a cycle
- <9, 5, 0, 13> forms a cycle
- <10, 1, 13, 0> forms a cycle
- <10, 9, 14, 3> forms a cycle
- <11, 5, 9, 10> forms a cycle
- <12, 9, 5, 0> forms a cycle
- <12, 9, 14, 3> forms a cycle
- <12, 1, 13, 0> forms a cycle
- <12, 2, 5, 9> forms a cycle
- <13, 1, 10, 9> forms a cycle
- <14, 9, 5, 0> forms a cycle

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- From the list above, we find that the cycle <1, 10, 11, 6> has exactly one chord (edge 10-6).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- As there is only one cycle with exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 10, 11, 6>.
