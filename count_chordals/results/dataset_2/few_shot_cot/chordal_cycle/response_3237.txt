Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 14, 5, 8, 12, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 12, 8, 1, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 12, 13, 7, 1, 14, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 11, 7, 13, 12, 8, 5, 14, 1, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 11, 4, 10, 9, 8, 12, 6, 1, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 12, 8, 9, 10, 4, 11, 7, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 12, 13, 7, 11, 4, 10, 9, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 14, 5, 8, 12, 13, 7, 11, 4, 1>
- Cycle 9: <2, 9, 10, 4, 11, 7, 13, 12, 8, 2>
- Cycle 10: <3, 9, 10, 4, 11, 7, 13, 12, 6, 3>
- Cycle 11: <4, 10, 9, 8, 12, 6, 1, 14, 5, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 11, 7, 13, 12, 6, 1, 14, 5, 4>
- Cycle 13: <5, 14, 1, 6, 12, 13, 7, 11, 4, 5>
- Cycle 14: <7, 11, 4, 10, 9, 8, 12, 13, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 11, 4, 10, 9, 8, 12, 6, 1, 0>, Chord: (4, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found with 1 chord.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
