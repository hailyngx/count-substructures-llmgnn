Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-3-2-4-0 with edges (0, 3), (3, 2), (2, 4), (4, 0)
- Cycle 2: 0-6-13-2-0 with edges (0, 6), (6, 13), (13, 2), (2, 0)
- Cycle 3: 1-7-19-4-1 with edges (1, 7), (7, 19), (19, 4), (4, 1)
- Cycle 4: 1-14-9-3-1 with edges (1, 14), (14, 9), (9, 3), (3, 1)
- Cycle 5: 2-3-17-13-2 with edges (2, 3), (3, 17), (17, 13), (13, 2)
- Cycle 6: 4-19-7-1-4 with edges (4, 19), (19, 7), (7, 1), (1, 4)
- Cycle 7: 5-8-12-15-5 with edges (5, 8), (8, 12), (12, 15), (15, 5)
- Cycle 8: 5-17-16-4-5 with edges (5, 17), (17, 16), (16, 4), (4, 5)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (0, 4)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (0, 2)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (2, 13)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (8, 15)
- Cycle 8 is already chordal.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <0, 3, 2, 4, (0, 4)>
