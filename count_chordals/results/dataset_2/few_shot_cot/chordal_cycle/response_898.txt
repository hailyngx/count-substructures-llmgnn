4. <3, 15, 14, 4>
5. <3, 16, 18, 1>
6. <3, 16, 6, 1>
7. <3, 16, 9, 2>
8. <3, 12, 7, 4>
9. <15, 8, 17, 5>
10. <15, 14, 4, 7>
11. <15, 17, 8, 9>
12. <15, 17, 5, 10>
13. <8, 17, 15, 3>

38. <6, 1, 18, 16>
39. <6, 13, 7, 4>
40. <13, 7, 12, 3>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle is: 
- <3, 15, 14, 0>, chord: (3, 14)

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
