Response:
The graph contains the following unique chordal 4-cycle: <1, 11, 14, 9>.

We need to count the number of chordless cycles found, and then put this final number inside brackets. Let's follow the steps provided in the initial prompt:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- We find the following cycles: <1, 6, 4, 5>, <1, 6, 5, 2>, <1, 7, 0, 13>, <1, 9, 14, 3>, <1, 11, 12, 10>, <3, 4, 5, 2>, <3, 4, 6, 1>, <3, 14, 9, 10>, <2, 5, 6, 4>, <2, 5, 10, 8>, <2, 13, 0, 7>, <2, 13, 5, 8>, <2, 14, 9, 10>, <5, 6, 4, 10>, <5, 6, 1, 7>, <5, 8, 10, 12>, <5, 10, 4, 3>, <5, 10, 7, 1>, <8, 5, 6, 1>, <8, 5, 10, 12>, <8, 10, 4, 3>, <8, 10, 12, 11>, <10, 9, 14, 3>, <10, 9, 1, 7>, <10, 12, 6, 1>, <10, 12, 11, 14>, <10, 7, 0, 13>, <11, 1, 6, 4>, <11, 1, 7, 0>, <11, 14, 9, 10>, <12, 6, 1, 7>, <12, 6, 4, 10>, <12, 11, 14, 9>, <0, 7, 1, 6>, <0, 7, 10, 12>, <0, 13, 5, 6>, <0, 13, 2, 3>, <0, 14, 9, 10>, <14, 9, 1, 6>, <14, 9, 10, 12>, <14, 11, 12, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <1, 11, 14, 9> has exactly one chord (1, 11).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 43 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final result to be put inside brackets is [43].
