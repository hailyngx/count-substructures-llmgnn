Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 16, 6, 18> (chords: (0, 6))
- Cycle 2: <0, 16, 3, 19> (chords: (0, 3))
- Cycle 3: <1, 8, 18, 11> (chords: (1, 18))
- Cycle 4: <1, 8, 3, 16> (chords: (1, 3))
- Cycle 5: <1, 13, 5, 4> (chords: (1, 5))
- Cycle 6: <1, 13, 15, 14> (chords: (1, 15))
- Cycle 7: <2, 10, 16, 6> (chords: (2, 16))
- Cycle 8: <2, 14, 3, 16> (chords: (2, 3))
- Cycle 9: <4, 13, 5, 19> (chords: (4, 5))

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1: <0, 16, 6, 18> (chords: (0, 6)), Chordal cycle
- Cycle 2: <0, 16, 3, 19> (chords: (0, 3)), Chordal cycle
- Cycle 3: <1, 8, 18, 11> (chords: (1, 18)), Chordal cycle
- Cycle 4: <1, 8, 3, 16> (chords: (1, 3)), Chordal cycle
- Cycle 5: <1, 13, 5, 4> (chords: (1, 5)), Chordal cycle
- Cycle 6: <1, 13, 15, 14> (chords: (1, 15)), Chordal cycle
- Cycle 7: <2, 10, 16, 6> (chords: (2, 16)), Chordal cycle
- Cycle 8: <2, 14, 3, 16> (chords: (2, 3)), Chordal cycle
- Cycle 9: <4, 13, 5, 19> (chords: (4, 5)), Chordal cycle

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. As all cycles are chordal, there are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [9].
