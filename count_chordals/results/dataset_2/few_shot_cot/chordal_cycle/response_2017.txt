- Cycle 30: <4, 23, 25, 3, 24>
- Cycle 31: <4, 6, 14, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 12, 7, 10> has one chord (7, 10).
- The cycle <0, 12, 7, 8> has one chord (7, 8).
- The cycle <0, 12, 7, 10, 21> has one chord (7, 21).
- The cycle <0, 12, 7, 10, 26> has one chord (7, 26).
- The cycle <0, 12, 7, 8, 13> has one chord (7, 13).
- The cycle <1, 20, 26, 6> has one chord (1, 26).
- The cycle <2, 22, 9, 21> has one chord (9, 21).
- The cycle <3, 24, 18, 17> has one chord (18, 17).
- The cycle <3, 24, 18, 8> has one chord (18, 8).
- The cycle <3, 24, 18, 5> has one chord (18, 5).
- The cycle <4, 23, 25, 3> has one chord (23, 25).
- The cycle <4, 23, 25, 11> has one chord (23, 11).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 21 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [21].
