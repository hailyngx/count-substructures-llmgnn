Response:
Step 1: From the given edges, we can identify the following 4-cycles:
- <10, 0, 3, 2>
- <10, 0, 15, 4>
- <10, 12, 18, 13>
- <10, 14, 1, 6>
- <10, 14, 6, 8>
- <10, 14, 12, 15>
- <0, 15, 4, 19>
- <0, 3, 2, 18>
- <0, 3, 2, 8>
- <0, 15, 12, 18>
- <3, 2, 8, 6>
- <3, 2, 18, 12>
- <1, 18, 12, 10>
- <1, 18, 17, 16>
- <1, 6, 8, 2>
- <1, 6, 14, 12>
- <1, 4, 19, 13>
- <17, 18, 12, 10>
- <17, 18, 13, 19>
- <13, 19, 7, 11>
- <13, 19, 9, 15>
- <6, 8, 12, 10>
- <6, 14, 10, 0>
- <6, 14, 12, 15>
- <4, 19, 13, 10>
- <4, 19, 9, 15>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <10, 0, 3, 2> has chord (0, 2)
- <10, 12, 18, 13> has chord (12, 13)
- <10, 14, 1, 6> has chord (14, 1)
- <10, 14, 6, 8> has chord (14, 6)
- <0, 15, 4, 19> has chord (15, 4)
- <0, 3, 2, 18> has chord (3, 18)
- <1, 18, 12, 10> has chord (18, 12)
- <17, 18, 12, 10> has chord (18, 10)
- <13, 19, 7, 11> has chord (19, 7)
- <6, 14, 10, 0> has chord (14, 10)
- <4, 19, 13, 10> has chord (19, 13)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 16 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [16].
