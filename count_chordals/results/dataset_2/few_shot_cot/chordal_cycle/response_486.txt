Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle <0, 3, 9, 5>
- Cycle <0, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle <0, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle <0, 9, 5, 1>
- Cycle <2, 5, 1, 8>
- Cycle <2, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle <3, 4, 7, 0>
- Cycle <3, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle <4, 1, 5, 8>
- Cycle <5, 1, 8, 4>
- Cycle <5, 2, 7, 6>
- Cycle <5, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle <5, 8, 4, 7>
- Cycle <6, 2, 7, 4>
- Cycle <7, 4, 8, 5>
- Cycle <7, 6, 2, 5>
- Cycle <8, 5, 1, 4>
- Cycle <9, 0, 7, 4>
- Cycle <9, 5, 1, 8>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Chordal 4-cycle <0, (3, 9), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, (7, 4), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, (9, 5), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, (5, 1), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, (7, 4), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, (4, 7), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, (7, 6), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, (1, 5), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, (1, 8), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, (2, 7), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, (6, 7), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, (8, 4), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, (2, 7), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, (4, 8), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, (6, 2), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle <8, (5, 1), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle <9, (0, 7), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle <9, (5, 1), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [18]
