Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 12) (3, 8) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 6) (12, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 10) (6, 12) (6, 5) (6, 2) (13, 4) (13, 9) (0, 3) (0, 9) (14, 7) (14, 8) (14, 4) (14, 10) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 12) (8, 14) (9, 3) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 10) (4, 5) (4, 13) (4, 14) (4, 2) (4, 11) (11, 2) (11, 4) (10, 1) (10, 7) (10, 5) (10, 14) (10, 2) (10, 9)

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<1, 3, 0, 9> - 4-cycle
<1, 3, 8, 12> - 4-cycle
<1, 2, 9, 10> - 4-cycle
<1, 8, 12, 3> - 4-cycle
<2, 1, 3, 0, 9> - 5-cycle
<2, 1, 3, 12, 6> - 5-cycle
<2, 1, 8, 12, 6> - 5-cycle
<2, 1, 8, 3, 0> - 5-cycle
<2, 9, 10, 1, 3> - 5-cycle
<3, 0, 9, 13, 4> - 5-cycle
<3, 1, 8, 14, 7> - 5-cycle
<3, 1, 10, 7, 5> - 5-cycle
<3, 8, 14, 4, 11> - 5-cycle
<3, 12, 6, 5, 7> - 5-cycle
<4, 5, 7, 14, 8> - 5-cycle
<4, 11, 2, 6, 12> - 5-cycle
...

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (2, 9), 10>
<1, (3, 8), 12>
<2, (1, 3), 0>
<2, (1, 8), 12>
...

Therefore, the count of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
