Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. <0, 5, 4, 1>
2. <0, 5, 2, 1>
3. <0, 6, 4, 1>
4. <0, 6, 7, 5>
5. <1, 9, 8, 2>
6. <1, 9, 7, 5>
7. <1, 4, 9, 8>
8. <1, 4, 2, 5>
9. <2, 5, 4, 9>
10. <3, 7, 5, 6>
11. <3, 7, 1, 9>
12. <4, 5, 2, 1>
13. <4, 5, 0, 6>
14. <4, 9, 8, 2>
15. <4, 9, 1, 7>
16. <5, 6, 7, 0>
17. <5, 6, 0, 9>
18. <5, 2, 1, 4>
19. <5, 7, 6, 0>
20. <7, 1, 9, 8>
21. <7, 1, 4, 5>
22. <7, 3, 2, 5>
23. <8, 9, 1, 4>
24. <9, 1, 4, 5>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycle is:
<0, 5, 4, 1> with chord (4, 9)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [23].
