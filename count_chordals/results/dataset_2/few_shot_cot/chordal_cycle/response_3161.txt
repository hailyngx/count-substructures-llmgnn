- Cycle 23: <23, 7, 14, 17, 0, 3, 29, 2, 25, 5>
- Cycle 24: <25, 9, 24, 14, 12, 6, 8, 16, 13, 27>

- Cycle 27: <28, 8, 16, 13, 27, 9, 24, 14, 7, 26>
- Cycle 28: <29, 2, 25, 5, 20, 6, 12, 17, 14, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <2, 29, 20, 6, 12, 17, 14, 7, 26, 23, 25, 5> has a chord: (12, 7)
- <4, 19, 10, 1, 11, 2, 25, 23, 26, 7, 14> has a chord: (11, 23)
- <14, 17, 12, 6, 8, 28, 5, 25, 23, 7> has a chord: (8, 23)
- <15, 12, 14, 7, 23, 25, 2, 29, 20, 6> has a chord: (14, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 24 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [24].
