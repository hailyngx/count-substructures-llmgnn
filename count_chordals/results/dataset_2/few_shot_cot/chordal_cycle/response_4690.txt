Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- <0, 5, 17, 11, 1>
- <0, 5, 13, 16, 7>
- <1, 4, 8, 3, 17>
- <1, 4, 8, 18, 10>
- <3, 17, 11, 1, 7>
- <3, 8, 18, 10, 17>
- <4, 8, 3, 17, 5>
- <5, 13, 2, 4, 8>
- <5, 17, 11, 15, 0>
- <6, 9, 8, 4, 2>
- <6, 12, 18, 10, 17>
- <7, 16, 13, 5, 17>
- <10, 17, 3, 8, 4>
- <11, 17, 5, 0, 15>
- <11, 1, 4, 8, 18>
- <13, 5, 17, 11, 15>
- <16, 13, 5, 17, 3>
  
Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 4, 8, 3, (17, 11)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 4, (8, 18), 10, 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (17, 11), 1, 7, 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (8, 18), 10, 17, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 8, 3, (17, 5), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 17, 11, (15, 0), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 13, 2, 4, (8, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <7, 16, 13, 5, (17, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <10, 17, 3, (8, 4), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <11, 17, 5, 0, (15, 1)>
  
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are [6] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
