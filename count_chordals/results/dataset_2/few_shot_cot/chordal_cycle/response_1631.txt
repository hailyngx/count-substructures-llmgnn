- Cycle B: <1, 3, 7, 2, 5>
- Cycle C: <1, 3, 8, 12, 6>
- Cycle D: <1, 10, 2, 7, 12>
- Cycle E: <1, 5, 4, 6, 14>
- Cycle F: <3, 7, 12, 8, 9>
- Cycle G: <3, 8, 12, 6, 14>
- Cycle H: <7, 2, 10, 6, 4>
- Cycle I: <7, 3, 8, 14, 9>
- Cycle J: <7, 12, 6, 14, 9>
- Cycle K: <12, 8, 9, 14, 11>
- Cycle L: <12, 11, 5, 2, 7>
- Cycle M: <12, 13, 9, 14, 6>

- Cycle O: <14, 4, 0, 1, 5>
- Cycle P: <14, 9, 8, 0, 1>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle A has a chord 4, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<1, 0, 10, 6, 4>]
- Cycle B has a chord 5, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<1, 3, 7, 2, 5>]
- Cycle C has a chord 6, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<1, 3, 8, 12, 6>]
- Cycle D has a chord 10, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<1, 10, 2, 7, 12>]
- Cycle E has a chord 14, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<1, 5, 4, 6, 14>]
- Cycle F has a chord 9, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<3, 7, 12, 8, 9>]
- Cycle G has a chord 6, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<3, 8, 12, 6, 14>]
- Cycle H has a chord 4, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<7, 2, 10, 6, 4>]
- Cycle I has a chord 14, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<7, 3, 8, 14, 9>]
- Cycle J has a chord 6, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<7, 12, 6, 14, 9>]
- Cycle K has a chord 9, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<12, 8, 9, 14, 11>]
- Cycle L has a chord 7, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<12, 11, 5, 2, 7>]
- Cycle M has a chord 12, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<12, 13, 9, 14, 6>]
- Cycle N has a chord 11, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<14, 6, 4, 5, 11>]
- Cycle O has a chord 5, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<14, 4, 0, 1, 5>]
- Cycle P has a chord 1, making it a chordal 4-cycle [<14, 9, 8, 0, 1>]

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]
