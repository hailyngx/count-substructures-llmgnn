Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 9, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 2, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 3, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 4, 7, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 2, 3, 1>
- Cycle 6: <4, 7, 2, 5, 4>
- Cycle 7: <4, 8, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 8: <6, 7, 2, 5, 6>
- Cycle 9: <6, 8, 4, 2, 6>
- Cycle 10: <7, 4, 2, 3, 7>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 1)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (6, 4)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (5, 2)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (7, 5)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (7, 6)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (7, 5)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (8, 4)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (4, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
We found 10 cycles with exactly one chord.
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
