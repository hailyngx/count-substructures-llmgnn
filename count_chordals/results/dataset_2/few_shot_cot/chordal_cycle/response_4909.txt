Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <1, 19, 24, 26>. 

Following the method outlined above, here is the step-by-step calculation for counting the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <1, 27, 0, 21>
- Cycle 2: <1, 27, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 19, 24, 26>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 is chordless
- Cycle 2 is chordless
- Cycle 3 has one chord - (19, 26)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 2 chordless cycles found, so the final number to be put inside brackets is [2].
