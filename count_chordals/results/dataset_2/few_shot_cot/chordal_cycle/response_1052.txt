Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1 - 4 - 22 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 2: 3 - 7 - 26 - 18 - 3

Step 2: Checking for chords:
- Cycle 1 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 2 does not have a chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- No chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph.
