Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 3, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 9, 13, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 7, 4, 6)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 10, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 10, 12, 7)
- Cycle 6: (1, 10, 12, 1)
- Cycle 7: (3, 1, 4, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 1, 10, 3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 5, 11, 3)
- Cycle 10: (10, 11, 5, 10)
- Cycle 11: (11, 5, 8, 11)
- Cycle 12: (5, 8, 14, 5)
- Cycle 13: (8, 14, 9, 8)
- Cycle 14: (14, 9, 6, 14)
- Cycle 15: (14, 7, 2, 14)
- Cycle 16: (6, 4, 1, 3, 6)
- Cycle 17: (6, 9, 0, 3, 6)

Step 2: Checking for one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (6, 3)> - Chord: (6, 3)
- <2, (6, 13)> - Chord: (6, 13)
- <3, (6, 4)> - Chord: (6, 4)
- <4, (7, 10)> - Chord: (7, 10)
- <5, (10, 12)> - Chord: (10, 12)
- <6, (1, 12)> - Chord: (1, 12)
- <7, (1, 4)> - Chord: (1, 4)
- <8, (1, 10)> - Chord: (1, 10)
- <9, (5, 11)> - Chord: (5, 11)
- <10, (10, 5)> - Chord: (10, 5)
- <11, (5, 8)> - Chord: (5, 8)
- <12, (8, 14)> - Chord: (8, 14)
- <13, (9, 6)> - Chord: (9, 6)
- <14, (6, 3, 0)> - Chord: (6, 3, 0)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 4 chordless cycles in the graph.
Therefore, the final count is [4].
