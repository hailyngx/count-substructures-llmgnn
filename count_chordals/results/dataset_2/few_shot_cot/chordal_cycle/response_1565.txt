Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 7, 10, 6, 5>
- <0, 7, 10, 12, 4>
- <0, 7, 11, 3, 9>
- <0, 7, 11, 8, 1>
- <1, 4, 12, 5, 6>
- <1, 8, 11, 7, 10>
- <1, 13, 2, 5, 12>
- <1, 14, 9, 3, 11>
- <2, 5, 6, 10, 7>
- <2, 5, 12, 13, 1>
- <2, 6, 10, 7, 5>
- <2, 13, 12, 4, 7>
- <2, 14, 1, 8, 11>
- <3, 4, 12, 10, 7>
- <3, 9, 14, 1, 8>
- <3, 11, 7, 10, 12>
- <4, 9, 14, 2, 5>
- <4, 12, 10, 7, 0>
- <5, 7, 11, 3, 9>
- <6, 10, 12, 4, 7>
- <8, 9, 14, 2, 13>
- <8, 11, 3, 9, 14>
- <9, 14, 2, 6, 10>
- <10, 12, 4, 1, 8>
- <12, 13, 2, 5, 6>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is:
- <3, 4, 12, 10, 7> with a chord (3, 10)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [24].
