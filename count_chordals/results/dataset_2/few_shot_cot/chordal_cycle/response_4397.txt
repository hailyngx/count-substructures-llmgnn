Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-16-5-4
- Cycle 2: 7-12-18-11-7
- Cycle 3: 13-18-12-6-13
- Cycle 4: 7-19-1-15-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 4-16
- Cycle 2 has a chord 12-11
- Cycle 3 has a chord 12-6
- Cycle 4 has a chord 1-15

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
As there are no chordless cycles found, the number inside brackets is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <4, 16, 7, 5> with chord (4, 16)
- <7, 12, 18, 11> with chord (12, 11)
- <13, 18, 6, 12> with chord (12, 6)
- <7, 19, 1, 15> with chord (1, 15)
