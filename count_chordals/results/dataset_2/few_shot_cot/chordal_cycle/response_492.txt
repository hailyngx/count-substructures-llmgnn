Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <0, 5, 10, 17>
2. <0, 5, 13, 15>
3. <3, 7, 9, 19>
4. <4, 17, 10, 5>
5. <7, 9, 10, 13>
6. <8, 16, 3, 11>
7. <8, 18, 17, 10>
8. <11, 16, 3, 7>
9. <14, 7, 9, 19>
10. <14, 12, 1, 8>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chord in <0, 5, 10, 17>: (5, 10)
- Chord in <0, 5, 13, 15>: (5, 13)
- Chord in <3, 7, 9, 19>: (7, 9)
- Chord in <4, 17, 10, 5>: (10, 17)
- Chord in <7, 9, 10, 13>: (9, 10)
- Chord in <8, 16, 3, 11>: (8, 16)
- Chord in <8, 18, 17, 10>: (8, 17)
- Chord in <11, 16, 3, 7>: (11, 16)
- Chord in <14, 7, 9, 19>: (7, 19)
- Chord in <14, 12, 1, 8>: (12, 8)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, 5, 10, 17> with chord (5, 10)
2. <0, 5, 13, 15> with chord (5, 13)
3. <3, 7, 9, 19> with chord (7, 9)
4. <4, 17, 10, 5> with chord (10, 17)
5. <7, 9, 10, 13> with chord (9, 10)
6. <8, 16, 3, 11> with chord (8, 16)
7. <8, 18, 17, 10> with chord (8, 17)
8. <11, 16, 3, 7> with chord (11, 16)
9. <14, 7, 9, 19> with chord (7, 19)
10. <14, 12, 1, 8> with chord (12, 8)
