Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 6, 5, 4>
- <0, 6, 5, 7>
- <0, 7, 5, 4>
- <1, 7, 5, 4>
- <1, 7, 5, 14>
- <1, 8, 3, 6>
- <1, 8, 3, 12>
- <1, 8, 3, 14>
- <1, 8, 12, 4>
- <1, 10, 4, 5>
- <1, 10, 4, 12>
- <3, 6, 5, 4>
- <3, 6, 5, 7>
- <3, 8, 1, 7>
- <3, 8, 10, 13>
- <3, 8, 12, 4>
- <3, 11, 9, 13>
- <3, 11, 10, 4>
- <4, 5, 9, 6>
- <4, 5, 9, 11>
- <4, 5, 14, 7>
- <4, 10, 13, 7>
- <4, 12, 3, 8>
- <5, 6, 3, 14>
- <5, 6, 9, 11>
- <5, 7, 0, 13>
- <5, 7, 1, 8>
- <5, 7, 13, 10>
- <5, 9, 11, 3>
- <6, 9, 11, 3>
- <7, 5, 14, 11>
- <7, 13, 10, 8>
- <8, 10, 1, 7>
- <8, 10, 4, 12>
- <11, 9, 13, 10>
- <12, 4, 10, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 6, 5, 4> (chord: 5-6)
- <1, 8, 3, 12> (chord: 8-12)
- <3, 8, 12, 4> (chord: 8-12)
- <4, 5, 9, 6> (chord: 5-9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
