Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 15, 13> with edges (0, 6), (6, 1), (1, 15), (15, 13), (13, 8), (8, 12), (12, 17), (17, 10), (10, 7), (7, 5), (5, 4), (4, 8)
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 11, 2, 10> with edges (0, 9), (9, 11), (11, 2), (2, 10), (10, 17), (17, 12), (12, 8), (8, 4), (4, 5), (5, 17), (17, 10)
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 11, 2, 5> with edges (0, 9), (9, 11), (11, 2), (2, 5), (5, 7), (7, 10), (10, 17), (17, 12), (12, 8), (8, 4), (4, 5)
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 11, 19, 3> with edges (0, 9), (9, 11), (11, 19), (19, 3), (3, 14), (14, 8), (8, 12), (12, 17), (17, 10), (10, 7), (7, 5), (5, 4)
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 0, 9, 11> with edges (1, 6), (6, 0), (0, 9), (9, 11), (11, 19), (19, 3), (3, 18), (18, 16), (16, 15), (15, 1)
- Cycle 6: <1, 15, 13, 7, 5> with edges (1, 15), (15, 13), (13, 7), (7, 5), (5, 2), (2, 11), (11, 19), (19, 3), (3, 14), (14, 8), (8, 4), (4, 5)
- Cycle 7: <2, 11, 19, 3, 14> with edges (2, 11), (11, 19), (19, 3), (3, 14), (14, 8), (8, 13), (13, 7), (7, 5), (5, 4), (4, 16), (16, 18)
- Cycle 8: <4, 8, 14, 3, 18> with edges (4, 8), (8, 14), (14, 3), (3, 18), (18, 12), (12, 8), (8, 13), (13, 15), (15, 16), (16, 4)
- Cycle 9: <5, 4, 16, 15, 1> with edges (5, 4), (4, 16), (16, 15), (15, 1), (1, 6), (6, 0), (0, 9), (9, 11), (11, 2), (2, 5)
- Cycle 10: <10, 17, 12, 8, 4> with edges (10, 17), (17, 12), (12, 8), (8, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2), (2, 11), (11, 9), (9, 0), (0, 6), (6, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (6, 13)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (9, 17)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (9, 11)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (15, 5)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (2, 14)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (8, 18)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (4, 1)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (17, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 6, 1, 15, 13>
<0, 9, 11, 2, 10>
<0, 9, 11, 2, 5>
<0, 9, 11, 19, 3>
<1, 15, 13, 7, 5>
<2, 11, 19, 3, 14>
<4, 8, 14, 3, 18>
<5, 4, 16, 15, 1>
<10, 17, 12, 8, 4>
<1, 6, 0, 9, 11>
