Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <0, 8, 14, 7, 0>
2. <0, 6, 9, 3, 4, 0>
3. <1, 9, 3, 4, 13, 1>
4. <2, 8, 6, 9, 4, 13, 2>
5. <3, 9, 1, 12, 0, 4, 3>
6. <4, 6, 5, 7, 14, 13, 4>
7. <7, 9, 1, 12, 8, 6, 5, 7>
8. <10, 3, 9, 1, 7, 14, 13, 11, 10>
9. <11, 10, 7, 9, 1, 12, 0, 4, 13, 11>
10. <12, 1, 9, 3, 4, 13, 14, 0, 8, 12>
11. <13, 11, 10, 7, 9, 3, 4, 0, 12, 8, 14, 13>
12. <14, 0, 6, 5, 7, 2, 8, 12, 1, 9, 4, 13, 14>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 8, 14, 7, 0> has a chord: (8, 14)
- <0, 6, 9, 3, 4, 0> has a chord: (6, 9)
- <1, 9, 3, 4, 13, 1> has a chord: (9, 13)
- <2, 8, 6, 9, 4, 13, 2> has a chord: (6, 13)
- <3, 9, 1, 12, 0, 4, 3> has a chord: (1, 4)
- <4, 6, 5, 7, 14, 13, 4> has a chord: (5, 14)
- <7, 9, 1, 12, 8, 6, 5, 7> has a chord: (1, 8)
- <10, 3, 9, 1, 7, 14, 13, 11, 10> has a chord: (3, 7)
- <11, 10, 7, 9, 1, 12, 0, 4, 13, 11> has a chord: (7, 12)
- <12, 1, 9, 3, 4, 13, 14, 0, 8, 12> has a chord: (1, 14)
- <13, 11, 10, 7, 9, 3, 4, 0, 12, 8, 14, 13> has a chord: (11, 4)
- <14, 0, 6, 5, 7, 2, 8, 12, 1, 9, 4, 13, 14> has a chord: (6, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
