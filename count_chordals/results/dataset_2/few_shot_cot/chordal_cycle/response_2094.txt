Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle with length 4: (0, 1, 5, 3, 0)
- Cycle with length 4: (0, 3, 7, 5, 0)
- Cycle with length 4: (0, 4, 6, 2, 0)
- Cycle with length 4: (1, 5, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle with length 4: (2, 4, 6, 9, 2)
- Cycle with length 4: (2, 5, 7, 3, 2)
- Cycle with length 4: (4, 6, 9, 2, 4)
- Cycle with length 4: (6, 7, 3, 9, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle (0, 1, 5, 3, 0) has a chord (1, 5)
- Cycle (0, 3, 7, 5, 0) has a chord (3, 7)
- Cycle (0, 4, 6, 2, 0) has a chord (4, 6)
- Cycle (1, 5, 7, 3, 1) has a chord (5, 7)
- Cycle (2, 4, 6, 9, 2) has a chord (4, 9)
- Cycle (2, 5, 7, 3, 2) has a chord (5, 7)
- Cycle (4, 6, 9, 2, 4) has a chord (6, 9)
- Cycle (6, 7, 3, 9, 6) has a chord (7, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (1, 5), 5)>
<2, (4, 9), 4)>
<3, (4, 6), 4)>
<4, (5, 7), 5)>
<5, (5, 7), 5)>
<6, (6, 9), 6)>
<7, (7, 9), 7)>
<8, (3, 7), 3)>
