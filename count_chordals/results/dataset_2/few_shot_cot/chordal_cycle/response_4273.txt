Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 13, 8, 14>
- Cycle 2: <0, 10, 2, 7, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 10, 3, 19, 15>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 19, 15, 17>
- Cycle 5: <0, 19, 3, 18, 16>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 2, 14, 16>
- Cycle 7: <4, 5, 13, 8, 18>
- Cycle 8: <4, 11, 6, 17, 15>
- Cycle 9: <5, 9, 16, 14, 8>
- Cycle 10: <9, 16, 14, 8, 13>
- Cycle 11: <11, 6, 17, 15, 19>
- Cycle 12: <13, 8, 14, 16, 18>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <0, 5, 13, 8, 14> has a chord (8, 13)
- <0, 10, 3, 19, 15> has a chord (3, 19)
- <0, 3, 19, 15, 17> has a chord (3, 17)
- <1, 7, 2, 14, 16> has a chord (2, 14)
- <4, 5, 13, 8, 18> has a chord (13, 8)
- <5, 9, 16, 14, 8> has a chord (16, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are [6] unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the answer is [6].
