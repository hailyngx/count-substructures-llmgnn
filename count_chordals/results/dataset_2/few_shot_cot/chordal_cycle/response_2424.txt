Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 7, 3, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 4, 7, 9, 1, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 4, 2, 9, 7, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 4, 6, 9, 7, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 1, 9, 7, 4, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 1, 8, 7, 4, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 1, 3, 7, 4, 0)
- Cycle 8: (2, 4, 7, 3, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 4, 7, 0, 9, 2)
- Cycle 10: (2, 4, 6, 9, 3, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 9, 1, 0, 4, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 9, 7, 4, 6, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 3, 7, 4, 0, 2)
- Cycle 14: (3, 7, 4, 2, 9, 3)
- Cycle 15: (3, 7, 0, 4, 6, 3)
- Cycle 16: (3, 1, 9, 7, 4, 3)
- Cycle 17: (3, 1, 0, 4, 6, 3)
- Cycle 18: (5, 3, 7, 0, 1, 5)
- Cycle 19: (5, 2, 4, 7, 3, 5)
- Cycle 20: (8, 7, 4, 0, 1, 8)
- Cycle 21: (8, 6, 4, 7, 0, 8)
- Cycle 22: (9, 7, 4, 2, 3, 9)
- Cycle 23: (9, 7, 0, 4, 6, 9)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (2, 5), 0>
- <2, (4, 6), 9>
- <3, (7, 9), 4>
- <4, (6, 8), 7>
- <5, (0, 1), 3>
- <6, (0, 8), 1>
- <7, (0, 3), 8>
- <8, (4, 7), 2>
- <9, (2, 9), 6>
- <10, (1, 4), 2>
- <11, (6, 2), 9>
- <12, (0, 2), 4>
- <13, (4, 6), 0>
- <14, (4, 0), 7>
- <15, (1, 7), 4>
- <16, (0, 1), 3>
- <17, (3, 5), 2>
- <18, (0, 8), 7>
- <19, (0, 1), 7>
- <20, (4, 7), 3>
- <21, (4, 0), 6>
- <22, (2, 3), 7>
- <23, (4, 6), 0>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 23 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [23].
