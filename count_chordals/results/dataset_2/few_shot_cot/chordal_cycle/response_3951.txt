Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (6, 9, 13, 27, 21) with edges (6, 9), (9, 13), (13, 27), (27, 21), (21, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 17, 2, 12, 1) with edges (6, 17), (17, 2), (2, 12), (12, 1), (1, 6)
- Cycle 3: (6, 22, 20, 26, 14) with edges (6, 22), (22, 20), (20, 26), (26, 14), (14, 6)
- Cycle 4: (7, 3, 23, 4, 21) with edges (7, 3), (3, 23), (23, 4), (4, 21), (21, 7)
- Cycle 5: (7, 22, 20, 28, 21) with edges (7, 22), (22, 20), (20, 28), (28, 21), (21, 7)
- Cycle 6: (9, 13, 27, 24, 25) with edges (9, 13), (13, 27), (27, 24), (24, 25), (25, 9)
- Cycle 7: (11, 17, 2, 12, 4) with edges (11, 17), (17, 2), (2, 12), (12, 4), (4, 11)
- Cycle 8: (15, 1, 12, 4, 23) with edges (15, 1), (1, 12), (12, 4), (4, 23), (23, 15)
- Cycle 9: (15, 24, 27, 21, 28) with edges (15, 24), (24, 27), (27, 21), (21, 28), (28, 15)
- Cycle 10: (15, 25, 19, 29, 23) with edges (15, 25), (25, 19), (19, 29), (29, 23), (23, 15)
- Cycle 11: (16, 15, 1, 12, 17) with edges (16, 15), (15, 1), (1, 12), (12, 17), (17, 16)
- Cycle 12: (20, 26, 14, 6, 22) with edges (20, 26), (26, 14), (14, 6), (6, 22), (22, 20)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Only Cycle 7: (11, 17, 2, 12, 4) has exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) which is (11, 4), making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Since we found 1 chordal 4-cycle, the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<11, (11, 4), 17, 2, 12>
