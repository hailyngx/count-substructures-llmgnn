Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 4, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 9, 13, 2>
- Cycle 4: <3, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle 5: <4, 7, 13, 4>
- Cycle 6: <5, 1, 3, 5>
- Cycle 7: <6, 10, 7, 6>
- Cycle 8: <8, 1, 3, 8>
- Cycle 9: <9, 2, 13, 9>
- Cycle 10: <10, 3, 4, 10>
- Cycle 11: <11, 4, 7, 11>
- Cycle 12: <12, 9, 13, 12>
- Cycle 13: <13, 7, 4, 13>
- Cycle 14: <14, 1, 5, 14>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- In Cycle 4: <3, 4, 7, 13>, the chord is (4, 13).
- In Cycle 6: <5, 1, 3, 4>, the chord is (1, 4).
- In Cycle 9: <9, 2, 13, 12>, the chord is (2, 12).
- In Cycle 11: <11, 4, 7, 13>, the chord is (4, 13).
- In Cycle 13: <13, 7, 4, 11>, the chord is (7, 11).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 9 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [9].
