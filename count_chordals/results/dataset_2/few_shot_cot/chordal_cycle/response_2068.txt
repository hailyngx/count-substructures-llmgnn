- Cycle 39: <13, 6, 5, 9, 3>
- Cycle 40: <14, 4, 10, 7, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycles: 
  <1, 7, 4, 14, 13> (Chord: (1, 5))
  <1, 7, 9, 5, 6> (Chord: (1, 5))
  <2, 5, 9, 11, 10> (Chord: (9, 11))
  <2, 10, 7, 6, 5> (Chord: (2, 6))
  <4, 7, 1, 5, 6> (Chord: (4, 6))
  <4, 10, 2, 6, 14> (Chord: (10, 6))
  <6, 5, 2, 10, 7> (Chord: (6, 10))
  <7, 4, 14, 11, 8> (Chord: (8, 11))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found.
- Therefore, the final count is [8].
