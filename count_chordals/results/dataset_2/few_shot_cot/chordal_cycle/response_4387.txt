Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4:
- (0, 13, 4, 6, 0)
- (0, 13, 6, 7, 0)
- (0, 14, 11, 6, 0)
- (0, 14, 3, 10, 0)
- (1, 8, 13, 4, 1)
- (1, 8, 9, 7, 1)
- (1, 11, 14, 0, 1)
- (1, 11, 5, 10, 1)
- (2, 10, 3, 4, 2)
- (2, 6, 11, 14, 2)
- (3, 10, 7, 12, 3)
- (3, 12, 0, 14, 3)
- (4, 13, 8, 1, 4)
- (5, 10, 3, 14, 5)
- (6, 13, 4, 3, 6)
- (7, 10, 2, 6, 7)
- (7, 12, 0, 9, 7)
- (9, 8, 1, 6, 9)
- (9, 14, 11, 6, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles:
<0, (13, 6), 4, (0, 7)>
<1, (8, 13), 4, (1, 7)>
<1, (11, 14), 0, (1, 5)>
<2, (10, 3), 4, (2, 6)>
<3, (10, 7), 12, (3, 14)>
<9, (8, 1), 6, (9, 14)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are [6] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
