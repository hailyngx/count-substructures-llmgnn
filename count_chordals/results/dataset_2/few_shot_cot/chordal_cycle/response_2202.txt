Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 14, 13, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 6, 14, 17, 11, 16, 2, 12, 4, 15, 13, 1, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 16, 2, 12, 4, 9)
- Cycle 4: (0, 10, 6, 14, 17, 11, 16, 3, 5, 1, 13, 7, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 7, 13, 14, 6, 10, 19, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has chord (9, 4).
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Therefore, there are [3] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. These are:
- <5, 6, 14, 13, 1>
- <0, 10, 6, 14, 17, 11, 16, 3, 5, 1, 13, 7>
- <0, 7, 13, 14, 6, 10, 19>
