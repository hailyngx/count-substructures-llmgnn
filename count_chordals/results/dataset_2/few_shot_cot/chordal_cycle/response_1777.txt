- Cycle 24: (7, 12, 3, 4) 
- Cycle 25: (9, 10, 1, 13) 
- Cycle 26: (11, 10, 1, 13) 
- Cycle 27: (13, 14, 7, 12) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (13, 9), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (13, 9), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (13, 14), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, (14, 7), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (4, 6), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (4, 3), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, (4, 10), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, (10, 9), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <1, (10, 11), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <2, (4, 6), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <2, (4, 3), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <2, (4, 10), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <2, (9, 6), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <2, (9, 11), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <3, (4, 6), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <3, (4, 10), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <3, (5, 7), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <3, (5, 8), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <5, (8, 6), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 20: <5, (8, 2), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 21: <5, (7, 12), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 22: <6, (8, 2), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 23: <6, (9, 10), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 24: <7, (12, 3), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 25: <9, (10, 1), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 26: <11, (10, 1), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 27: <13, (14, 7), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 27 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the answer is [27].
