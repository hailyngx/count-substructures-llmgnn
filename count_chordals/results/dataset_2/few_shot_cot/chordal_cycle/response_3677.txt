Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 5, 4, 0> with edges (0, 9), (9, 5), (5, 4), (4, 0)
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 6, 4, 0> with edges (0, 9), (9, 6), (6, 4), (4, 0)
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 3, 7, 0> with edges (0, 9), (9, 3), (3, 7), (7, 0)
- Cycle 4: <0, 2, 4, 5, 0> with edges (0, 2), (2, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0)
- Cycle 5: <0, 2, 8, 6, 0> with edges (0, 2), (2, 8), (8, 6), (6, 0)
- Cycle 6: <0, 7, 3, 2, 0> with edges (0, 7), (7, 3), (3, 2), (2, 0)
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 5, 3, 1> with edges (1, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3), (3, 1)
- Cycle 8: <1, 7, 3, 2, 1> with edges (1, 7), (7, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1)
- Cycle 9: <2, 4, 5, 3, 2> with edges (2, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3), (3, 2)
- Cycle 10: <3, 5, 4, 2, 3> with edges (3, 5), (5, 4), (4, 2), (2, 3)
- Cycle 11: <3, 7, 1, 4, 3> with edges (3, 7), (7, 1), (1, 4), (4, 3)
- Cycle 12: <3, 8, 6, 4, 3> with edges (3, 8), (8, 6), (6, 4), (4, 3)
- Cycle 13: <3, 9, 5, 4, 3> with edges (3, 9), (9, 5), (5, 4), (4, 3)
- Cycle 14: <4, 5, 9, 6, 4> with edges (4, 5), (5, 9), (9, 6), (6, 4)
- Cycle 15: <6, 8, 2, 4, 6> with edges (6, 8), (8, 2), (2, 4), (4, 6)
- Cycle 16: <7, 8, 2, 0, 7> with edges (7, 8), (8, 2), (2, 0), (0, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (9, 4)
- Cycle 2 has chord (9, 4)
- Cycle 4 has chord (2, 5)
- Cycle 5 has chord (2, 6)
- Cycle 6 has chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 9 has chord (3, 5)
- Cycle 10 has chord (3, 4)
- Cycle 11 has chord (7, 4)
- Cycle 12 has chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 13 has chord (3, 5)
- Cycle 14 has chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 15 has chord (8, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 7 chordless cycles in the graph, so the final count is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <0, 9, 5, 4> with chord (9, 4)
- <0, 9, 6, 4> with chord (9, 4)
- <0, 2, 4, 5> with chord (2, 5)
- <0, 2, 8, 6> with chord (2, 6)
- <0, 7, 3, 2> with chord (7, 3)
- <3, 9, 5, 4> with chord (3, 5)
- <7, 8, 2, 0> with chord (8, 4)
