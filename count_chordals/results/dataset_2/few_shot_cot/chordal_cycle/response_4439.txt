Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 13) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 6) (11, 8) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 1) (13, 10) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 7) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 6) (0, 10) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 6) (14, 9) (14, 0) (14, 3) (14, 12) (14, 2) (3, 9) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 14) (3, 7) (3, 12) (12, 4) (12, 14) (12, 3) (12, 6) (1, 5) (1, 11) (1, 8) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 13) (7, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 13, 14, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 11, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 11, 13, 14, 7, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 12, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 11, 4, 0, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 10, 13, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 13, 4, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 14, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph, but we will focus on those of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 10 - 13 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 10 - 7 - 5 - 2 - 14 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 10 - 13 - 3 - 12 - 4 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 4: 1 - 5 - 7 - 10 - 0 - 6 - 12 - 14 - 9 - 2 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 5: 2 - 5 - 7 - 10 - 13 - 3 - 9 - 2
- Cycle 6: 4 - 8 - 13 - 10 - 7 - 5 - 2 - 14 - 12 - 4
- Cycle 7: 6 - 4 - 12 - 14 - 9 - 3 - 13 - 8 - 1 - 11 - 6

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (8, 13), 11, 6>
- <2, (5, 9), 14, 0>
- <6, (4, 12), 14, 3>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [4].
