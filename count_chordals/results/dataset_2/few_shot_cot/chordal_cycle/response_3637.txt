Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <3, 6, 5, 8> with chord (3, 8)
- <7, 6, 5, 8> with chord (7, 8)
- <4, 5, 6, 9> with chord (4, 9)
- <0, 9, 6, 5> with chord (0, 6)
- <2, 9, 6, 5> with chord (2, 5)
- <0, 9, 5, 4> with chord (0, 5)
- <4, 9, 5, 6> with chord (4, 6)
- <2, 9, 5, 4> with chord (2, 4)
- <0, 9, 4, 3> with chord (0, 4)
- <2, 9, 4, 3> with chord (2, 3)

Step 2:

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <3, 6, 5, 8>
- <7, 6, 5, 8>
- <4, 5, 6, 9>
- <0, 9, 6, 5>
- <2, 9, 6, 5>
- <0, 9, 5, 4>
- <4, 9, 5, 6>
- <2, 9, 5, 4>
- <0, 9, 4, 3>
- <2, 9, 4, 3>
