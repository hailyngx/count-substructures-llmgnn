Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. (5, 6, 28, 19)
2. (5, 17, 24, 20)
3. (11, 4, 19, 28)
4. (11, 4, 19, 14)
5. (11, 15, 1, 27)
6. (11, 15, 1, 25)
7. (11, 16, 13, 22)
8. (11, 16, 13, 11)
9. (11, 16, 22, 20)
10. (11, 16, 22, 0)
11. (11, 16, 6, 5)
12. (14, 5, 17, 24)
13. (14, 5, 17, 25)
14. (14, 6, 28, 23)
15. (14, 6, 28, 19)
16. (14, 12, 18, 29)
17. (14, 12, 18, 2)
18. (16, 13, 22, 20)
19. (16, 13, 22, 0)
20. (16, 13, 11, 15)
21. (16, 6, 28, 19)
22. (16, 6, 28, 14)
23. (19, 4, 11, 15)
24. (19, 4, 11, 13)
25. (19, 4, 11, 16)
26. (19, 4, 11, 6)
27. (19, 28, 6, 16)
28. (19, 28, 6, 5)
29. (28, 6, 16, 11)
30. (28, 6, 16, 13)

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <11, (15, 16), 1, 27>
2. <11, (22, 0), 16, 13>
3. <14, (6, 28), 19, 4>
4. <14, (12, 18), 29, 2>

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [4].
