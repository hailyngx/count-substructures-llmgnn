Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: {9, 1, 13, 25, 27, 21, 9} - chordless cycle
- Cycle 2: {28, 9, 20, 10, 28} - chordless cycle
- Cycle 3: {16, 8, 11, 18, 16} - chordless cycle
- Cycle 4: {14, 0, 26, 14} - chordless cycle
- Cycle 5: {23, 14, 12, 3, 23} - chordless cycle
- Cycle 6: {22, 4, 9, 21, 22} - chordless cycle
- Cycle 7: {7, 22, 20, 10, 28, 18, 7} - chordless cycle
- Cycle 8: {15, 17, 24, 2, 15} - chordless cycle
- Cycle 9: {27, 25, 13, 1, 9, 21, 27} - chordless cycle
- Cycle 10: {6, 5, 21, 27, 19, 29, 13, 6} - chordless cycle
- Cycle 11: {3, 2, 24, 17, 27, 21, 9, 3} - chordless cycle

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Cycle 1 has a chord {1, 21}.
- Cycle 8 has a chord {17, 2}.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 9 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
<9, (1, 21)>
<16, 8, 11, 18, 16>
<14, 0, 26, 14>
<23, 14, 12, 3, 23>
<22, 4, 9, 21, 22>
<7, 22, 20, 10, 28, 18, 7>
<15, 17, 24, 2, 15>
<27, 25, 13, 1, 9, 21, 27>
<6, 5, 21, 27, 19, 29, 13, 6>
<3, 2, 24, 17, 27, 21, 9, 3>
