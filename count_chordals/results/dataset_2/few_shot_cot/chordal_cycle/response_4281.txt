Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
- We can identify the following cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
1. Cycle <0, 1, 3, 8>
2. Cycle <0, 2, 9, 6>
3. Cycle <0, 7, 9, 6>
4. Cycle <0, 7, 5, 4>
5. Cycle <1, 3, 6, 9>
6. Cycle <2, 9, 6, 7>
7. Cycle <3, 6, 8, 1>
8. Cycle <3, 6, 7, 9>
9. Cycle <4, 5, 7, 6>
10. Cycle <5, 7, 9, 6>

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. The cycle <0, 1, 3, 8> has exactly one chord (3, 8)
2. The cycle <0, 2, 9, 6> has exactly one chord (2, 6)
3. The cycle <0, 7, 9, 6> has exactly one chord (0, 9)
4. The cycle <0, 7, 5, 4> has exactly one chord (5, 7)
5. The cycle <1, 3, 6, 9> has exactly one chord (1, 6)
6. The cycle <2, 9, 6, 7> has exactly one chord (2, 6)
7. The cycle <3, 6, 8, 1> has exactly one chord (3, 8)
8. The cycle <3, 6, 7, 9> has exactly one chord (3, 9)
9. The cycle <4, 5, 7, 6> has exactly one chord (4, 7)
10. The cycle <5, 7, 9, 6> has exactly one chord (5, 9)

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [0] as all identified cycles have exactly one chord and none are chordless.

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is:
<0, 1, 3, 8> with chord (3, 8)
