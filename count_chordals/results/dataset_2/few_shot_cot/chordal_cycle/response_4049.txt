Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 1, 6, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 4, 2, 6, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 4, 0, 9, 5>
- Cycle 4: <9, 5, 6, 1, 9>
- Cycle 5: <9, 6, 2, 4, 9>
- Cycle 6: <9, 1, 8, 4, 9>
- Cycle 7: <6, 1, 8, 3, 6>
- Cycle 8: <6, 2, 7, 3, 6>
- Cycle 9: <4, 8, 7, 2, 4>
- Cycle 10: <0, 4, 8, 7, 0>
- Cycle 11: <0, 9, 3, 7, 0>
- Cycle 12: <3, 7, 0, 9, 3>
- Cycle 13: <3, 8, 1, 9, 3>
- Cycle 14: <3, 6, 2, 4, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord: <5, 9, 1, (6), 5>
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <5, 4, (2), 6, 5>
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <5, (4), 0, 9, 5>
- Cycle 4 has a chord: <9, 5, 6, (1), 9>
- Cycle 5 has a chord: <9, 6, (2), 4, 9>
- Cycle 6 has a chord: <9, 1, (8), 4, 9>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <6, 1, (8), 3, 6>
- Cycle 8 has a chord: <6, 2, (7), 3, 6>
- Cycle 9 has a chord: <4, 8, (7), 2, 4>
- Cycle 10 has a chord: <0, 4, (8), 7, 0>
- Cycle 11 has a chord: <0, 9, (3), 7, 0>
- Cycle 12 has a chord: <3, 7, (0), 9, 3>
- Cycle 13 has a chord: <3, 8, (1), 9, 3>
- Cycle 14 has a chord: <3, 6, (2), 4, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are [0] chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
