Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 0, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles of length 4: 
  - (4, 7, 2, 4)
  - (1, 8, 7, 4)
  - (1, 9, 3, 6)
  - (1, 4, 9, 3)
  - (2, 4, 1, 5)
  - (2, 4, 7, 8)
  - (2, 7, 8, 5)
  - (5, 8, 7, 4)
  - (5, 8, 1, 6)
  - (6, 1, 5, 2)
  - (6, 1, 4, 7)
  - (6, 4, 7, 9)
  - (9, 7, 4, 0)
  - (9, 7, 4, 1)
  - (9, 3, 6, 5)
  
Step 2:
- Unique chordal 4-cycles:
  - <1, 8, (7, 4), 5>
  - <1, 9, (3, 6), 4>
  - <2, 7, (8, 5), 4>
  - <6, 1, (4, 7), 5>

Step 3:
- The number of chordless 4-cycles is [11].
