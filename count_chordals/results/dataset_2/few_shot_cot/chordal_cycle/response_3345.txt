Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
1. <0, 6, 5, 1, 0>
2. <0, 6, 5, 2, 0>
3. <0, 9, 4, 7, 3, 2, 0>
4. <1, 3, 2, 5, 1>
5. <1, 5, 8, 4, 3, 1>
6. <2, 3, 4, 9, 2>
7. <2, 5, 1, 8, 4, 3, 2>
8. <3, 4, 9, 2, 3>
9. <4, 8, 7, 9, 4>
10. <5, 6, 9, 4, 8, 5>
11. <6, 9, 7, 3, 2, 5, 6>
12. <7, 8, 5, 2, 0, 6, 7>
13. <8, 1, 5, 2, 0, 6, 8>
14. <9, 4, 8, 1, 5, 6, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal cycles:
1. <0, 6, 5, 2, 0>   (Chord: (5, 2))
2. <0, 9, 4, 7, 3, 2, 0>   (Chord: (4, 3))
3. <2, 5, 1, 8, 4, 3, 2>   (Chord: (1, 4))
4. <4, 8, 7, 9, 4>   (Chord: (7, 9))
5. <6, 9, 7, 3, 2, 5, 6>   (Chord: (7, 3))
6. <7, 8, 5, 2, 0, 6, 7>   (Chord: (5, 6))
7. <8, 1, 5, 2, 0, 6, 8>   (Chord: (1, 2))
8. <9, 4, 8, 1, 5, 6, 9>   (Chord: (4, 5))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 14 cycles of length 4 in the graph, of which 8 are chordal cycles. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [6].
