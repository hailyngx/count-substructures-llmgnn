Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <5, 2, 6, 1, 9>
2. <5, 9, 7, 1, 4>
3. <5, 9, 6, 2, 5>
4. <5, 9, 7, 8, 4>
5. <2, 5, 9, 7, 1>
6. <2, 6, 9, 7, 1>
7. <2, 6, 1, 4, 7>
8. <2, 8, 4, 7, 1>
9. <6, 9, 7, 1, 4>
10. <6, 1, 4, 8, 7>
11. <8, 4, 7, 9, 6>
12. <8, 4, 0, 6, 2>
13. <8, 3, 0, 6, 2>
14. <8, 1, 7, 9, 5>
15. <0, 4, 7, 1, 9>
16. <0, 4, 1, 6, 9>
17. <0, 2, 6, 9, 5>
18. <0, 3, 8, 4, 1>
19. <3, 5, 9, 7, 1>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <5, 2, 6, 1, (9)>
2. <5, 9, 7, 1, (4)>
3. <5, 9, 7, 8, (4)>
4. <8, 4, 0, 6, (2)>
5. <8, 3, 0, 6, (2)>
6. <8, 1, 7, 9, (5)>
7. <0, 4, 1, 6, (9)>
8. <0, 2, 6, 9, (5)>
9. <0, 3, 8, 4, (1)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [10].
