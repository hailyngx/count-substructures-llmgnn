Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph, but not all of them have a chord. We need to identify the chordal 4-cycles.

Step 2:
After evaluating all the cycles of length 4, we find the unique chordal 4-cycle:
<13, 17, 15, 20> - Chord: (13, 15)

Step 3:
We found 1 chordal 4-cycle, so the final count is [1].
