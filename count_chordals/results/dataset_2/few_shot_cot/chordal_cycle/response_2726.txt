Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (7, 14), 12, 1>
Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (12, 5), 11, 5>
Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 6, 5, 8>
Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 6, 3, 13>
Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 12, 14, 10>
Chordal 4-cycle: <7, 1, 11, 3>
Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 2, 10, 1>
Chordal 4-cycle: <10, 14, 7, 13>
Chordal 4-cycle: <11, 5, 12, 3>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
