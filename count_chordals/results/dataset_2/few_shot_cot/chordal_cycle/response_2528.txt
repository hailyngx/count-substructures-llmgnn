This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 4, 6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 9, 7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 4, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 5, 4, 6, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 4, 8, 5, 2)
- Cycle 6: (3, 9, 4, 5, 3)
- Cycle 7: (4, 5, 8, 4, 9)
- Cycle 8: (5, 8, 2, 6, 5)
- Cycle 9: (6, 7, 1, 5, 6)
- Cycle 10: (7, 9, 3, 1, 7)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (1, 4) and (4, 6)
- Cycle 2 has 2 chords: (1, 3) and (3, 9)
- Cycle 6 has 2 chords: (3, 4) and (4, 5)
- Cycle 7 has 0 chords
- Cycle 8 has 0 chords
- Cycle 9 has 0 chords
- Cycle 10 has 2 chords: (1, 3) and (3, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (1, 4), 6, 5)>
<2, (1, 3), 9, 7)>
<3, (3, 4), 9, 5)>
