- <2, 16, 17, 27> (Chord: 16-27)
- <3, 24, 11, 5> (Chord: 11-5)
- <4, 5, 19, 18> (Chord: 19-18)
- <5, 19, 29, 4> (Chord: 29-4)
- <6, 27, 13, 23> (Chord: 13-23)
- <7, 26, 14, 21> (Chord: 14-21)
- <8, 11, 18, 19> (Chord: 18-19)
- <8, 13, 27, 17> (Chord: 27-17)
- <11, 18, 19, 29> (Chord: 19-29)
- <22, 7, 26, 10> (Chord: 26-10)
- <23, 13, 27, 17> (Chord: 27-17)
- <24, 11, 5, 4> (Chord: 11-4)
- <26, 14, 21, 4> (Chord: 14-4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 15 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [15].
