Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle <0, 9, 14, 3, 0>
        - Cycle <0, 9, 14, 1, 6, 11, 13, 3, 12, 6>
        - Cycle <0, 9, 14, 1, 6, 12, 7, 8, 13, 3>
        - Cycle <0, 9, 14, 1, 6, 12, 8, 13, 3>
        - Cycle <1, 6, 11, 13, 3, 12, 6>
        - Cycle <1, 6, 12, 7, 8, 13, 3>
        - Cycle <1, 6, 12, 8, 13, 3>
        - Cycle <2, 9, 14, 1, 6, 11, 13, 3>
        - Cycle <3, 13, 8, 12, 7>
        - Cycle <4, 11, 13, 3, 14, 10, 0>
        - Cycle <4, 11, 13, 1, 6, 12, 7, 8, 5, 10>
        - Cycle <4, 11, 13, 1, 6, 12, 8, 5, 10>
        - Cycle <5, 8, 7, 12, 6>
        - Cycle <10, 0, 9, 6, 12, 7, 8, 5>
        - Cycle <10, 0, 9, 6, 12, 8, 5>
Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle <0, 9, 14, 3, 0> has a chord (9, 3)
        - Cycle <0, 9, 14, 1, 6, 11, 13, 3, 12, 6> has a chord (11, 12)
        - Cycle <0, 9, 14, 1, 6, 12, 7, 8, 13, 3> has a chord (8, 13)
        - Cycle <0, 9, 14, 1, 6, 12, 8, 13, 3> has a chord (8, 13)
        - Cycle <1, 6, 11, 13, 3, 12, 6> has a chord (11, 12)
        - Cycle <1, 6, 12, 7, 8, 13, 3> has a chord (8, 13)
        - Cycle <1, 6, 12, 8, 13, 3> has a chord (8, 13)
        - Cycle <2, 9, 14, 1, 6, 11, 13, 3> has a chord (13, 11)
        - Cycle <4, 11, 13, 1, 6, 12, 7, 8, 5, 10> has a chord (5, 8)
        - Cycle <4, 11, 13, 1, 6, 12, 8, 5, 10> has a chord (5, 8)
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [9].
Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
        - <0, (9, 3), 14, 3>
        - <0, (11, 12), 6, 14>
        - <0, 9, 14, (8, 13), 3>
        - <1, (11, 12), 13, 12, 6>
        - <1, 6, 12, (8, 13), 3>
        - <2, 9, 14, 1, 6, 11, (13, 11), 3>
        - <4, 11, (5, 8), 10, 0>
