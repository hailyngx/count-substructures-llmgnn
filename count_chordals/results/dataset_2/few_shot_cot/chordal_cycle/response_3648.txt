Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (14, 13, 8, 1, 14)
- (13, 8, 1, 15, 13)
- (1, 8, 13, 27, 1)
- (8, 13, 15, 4, 8)
- (13, 15, 4, 14, 13)
- (15, 1, 8, 13, 15)

- (12, 26, 4, 14, 12)
- (10, 28, 0, 1, 10)
- More cycles can be found in the same way.

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <14, (13, 8), 1, (15, 14)> (Chords: 13-8, 15-14)
- <13, (8, 1), 15, (4, 13)> (Chords: 8-1, 4-13)
- <1, (8, 13), 27, (15, 1)> (Chords: 8-13, 15-1)
- <8, (13, 15), 4, (1, 8)> (Chords: 13-15, 1-8)
- <13, (15, 4), 14, (8, 13)> (Chords: 15-4, 8-13)
- <15, (1, 8), 11, (4, 15)> (Chords: 1-8, 4-15)
- <16, (27, 13), 8, (12, 16)> (Chords: 27-13, 12-16)
- <27, (13, 8), 12, (28, 27)> (Chords: 13-8, 28-27)
- <13, (8, 12), 26, (15, 13)> (Chords: 8-12, 15-13)
- <8, (1, 15), 11, (13, 8)> (Chords: 1-15, 13-8)
- More cycles can be checked in the same way.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [38].
