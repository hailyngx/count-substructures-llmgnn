Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - The cycles of length 4 or more are:
            - Cycle 1: <5, 2, 13, 17, 7, 6>
            - Cycle 2: <5, 2, 13, 12, 15, 18, 1, 19>
            - Cycle 3: <5, 12, 13, 17, 16, 19, 14, 9>
            - Cycle 4: <5, 15, 14, 9, 11, 14, 19, 16>
            - Cycle 5: <5, 1, 18, 15, 12, 13, 2, 16>

        Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
            - Checking Cycle 1: <5, 2, 13, 17, 7, 6> has chord (5, 17)
            - Checking Cycle 2: <5, 2, 13, 12, 15, 18, 1, 19> has chord (2, 18)
            - Checking Cycle 3: <5, 12, 13, 17, 16, 19, 14, 9> has chord (5, 17)
            - Checking Cycle 4: <5, 15, 14, 9, 11, 14, 19, 16> has chord (5, 14)
            - Checking Cycle 5: <5, 1, 18, 15, 12, 13, 2, 16> has chord (1, 15)

        Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
            There is a total of [0] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
