Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:

1. Cycle <0, 5, 7, 4> with edges (0, 5), (5, 7), (7, 4), (4, 0)
2. Cycle <1, 4, 7, 6> with edges (1, 4), (4, 7), (7, 6), (6, 1)
3. Cycle <2, 7, 4, 6> with edges (2, 7), (7, 4), (4, 6), (6, 2)
4. Cycle <3, 1, 4, 9> with edges (3, 1), (1, 4), (4, 9), (9, 3)
5. Cycle <5, 9, 4, 7> with edges (5, 9), (9, 4), (4, 7), (7, 5)
6. Cycle <8, 5, 7, 4> with edges (8, 5), (5, 7), (7, 4), (4, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle <0, 5, 7, 4> has chord (0, 7)
- Cycle <1, 4, 7, 6> has chord (1, 6)
- Cycle <2, 7, 4, 6> has chord (2, 4)
- Cycle <3, 1, 4, 9> has chord (3, 4)
- Cycle <5, 9, 4, 7> has chord (5, 7)
- Cycle <8, 5, 7, 4> has chord (8, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
