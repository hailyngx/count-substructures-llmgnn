Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 3, 6, 4>
2. <0, 3, 1, 9>
3. <0, 14, 9, 1>
4. <0, 14, 7, 4>
5. <1, 12, 11, 2>
6. <1, 13, 8, 5>
7. <1, 13, 4, 6>
8. <2, 4, 5, 7>
9. <2, 11, 12, 1>
10. <2, 14, 10, 0>
11. <3, 1, 13, 4>
12. <3, 6, 4, 7>
13. <4, 6, 7, 5>
14. <5, 8, 13, 4>
15. <5, 11, 12, 1>
16. <6, 3, 7, 4>
17. <7, 4, 13, 8>
18. <7, 5, 11, 2>
19. <8, 1, 13, 4>

22. <10, 0, 14, 7>
23. <11, 6, 3, 0>
24. <11, 12, 1, 9>
25. <12, 1, 13, 4>
26. <13, 1, 9, 14>
27. <13, 4, 6, 3>
28. <13, 7, 5, 8>
29. <14, 9, 1, 13>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <2, (4, 13), 5>
- <11, (6, 12), 2>

Step 3:
There are [2] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
