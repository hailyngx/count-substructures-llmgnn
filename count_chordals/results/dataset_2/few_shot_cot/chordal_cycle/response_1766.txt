Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 1

Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (6, 5, 4, 6) with edges (6, 5), (5, 4), (4, 6)
- Cycle 2: (6, 5, 2, 4, 6) with edges (6, 5), (5, 2), (2, 4), (4, 6)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 5, 6, 4) with edges (4, 8), (8, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 8, 5, 3, 4) with edges (4, 8), (8, 5), (5, 3), (3, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 3, 4, 6, 5) with edges (5, 3), (3, 4), (4, 6), (6, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 3, 9, 6, 5) with edges (5, 3), (3, 9), (9, 6), (6, 5)
- Cycle 7: (3, 9, 6, 4, 3) with edges (3, 9), (9, 6), (6, 4), (4, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 9, 1, 7, 6, 5, 3) with edges (3, 9), (9, 1), (1, 7), (7, 6), (6, 5), (5, 3)
- Cycle 9: (1, 2, 4, 8, 5, 6, 7, 1) with edges (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 8), (8, 5), (5, 6), (6, 7), (7, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has chord (4, 5).
- Cycle 4 has chord (4, 5).
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has chord (3, 6).
- Cycle 8 has chord (9, 5).
- Cycle 9 has chord (1, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found = 4
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <6, 5, 4, 6> with chord (4, 5)
2. <4, 8, 5, 6, 4> with chord (4, 5)
3. <3, 9, 6, 4, 3> with chord (3, 6)
4. <1, 2, 4, 8, 5, 6, 7, 1> with chord (1, 5)
