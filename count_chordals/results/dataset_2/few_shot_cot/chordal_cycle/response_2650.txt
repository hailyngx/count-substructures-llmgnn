Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

<5, 9, 7, 0, 5>
<5, 9, 4, 3, 5>
<5, 9, 1, 3, 5>
<5, 1, 3, 4, 5>
<9, 4, 3, 1, 9>
<9, 7, 0, 3, 9>
<4, 7, 0, 3, 4>
<4, 7, 6, 3, 4>
<7, 1, 3, 6, 7>
<7, 1, 5, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 6, 5, 1>
<1, 3, 4, 5, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

The cycle <5, 9, 1, 3, 5> has exactly one chord: (9, 1).
The cycle <9, 4, 3, 1, 9> has exactly one chord: (4, 1).
The cycle <4, 7, 0, 3, 4> has exactly one chord: (7, 3).
The cycle <1, 3, 6, 5, 1> has exactly one chord: (3, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [4].
