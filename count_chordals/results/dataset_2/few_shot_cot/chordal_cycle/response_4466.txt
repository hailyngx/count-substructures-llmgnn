Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 2, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle: <0, 4, 5, 1, 0> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
2. Cycle: <0, 4, 1, 3, 0> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
3. Cycle: <0, 4, 5, 3, 0> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
4. Cycle: <0, 4, 1, 9, 0> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
5. Cycle: <0, 6, 7, 2, 0> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
6. Cycle: <1, 4, 5, 3, 1> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
7. Cycle: <1, 4, 0, 3, 1> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
8. Cycle: <1, 4, 5, 5, 1> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
9. Cycle: <1, 4, 1, 9, 1> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
10. Cycle: <2, 7, 6, 8, 2> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
11. Cycle: <3, 1, 4, 5, 3> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
12. Cycle: <3, 1, 4, 1, 3> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
13. Cycle: <3, 1, 5, 5, 3> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
14. Cycle: <3, 5, 6, 8, 3> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
15. Cycle: <4, 0, 3, 5, 4> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
16. Cycle: <4, 1, 3, 5, 4> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
17. Cycle: <5, 4, 1, 3, 5> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
18. Cycle: <5, 4, 1, 9, 5> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
19. Cycle: <6, 7, 2, 0, 6> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
20. Cycle: <8, 5, 4, 1, 8> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
21. Cycle: <8, 5, 6, 7, 8> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
22. Cycle: <9, 7, 6, 2, 9> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
23. Cycle: <9, 1, 4, 5, 9> - Forms a cycle of length 4.
24. Cycle: <0, 4, 1, 9, 2, 7, 6, 5, 3, 0> - Forms a cycle of length 8.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 4, 1, 9, 2, 7, 6, 5, 3, 0> has one chord: (1, 6).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 24 cycles found and 1 of them is a chordal 4-cycle. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is 24 - 1 = 23.

Putting the final count in brackets: [23].
