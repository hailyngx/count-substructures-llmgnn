Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
The number of chordless 4-cycles in the given graph is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, 9, 1, 4> with chord (1-4)
<5, 9, 6, 0> with chord (0-6)
<1, 9, 3, 7> with chord (1-7)
<3, 9, 4, 2> with chord (2-4)
