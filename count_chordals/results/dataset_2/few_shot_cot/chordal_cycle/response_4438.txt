Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 6, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
Here are all the cycles of length 4 in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0-1-4-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-2-6-4-0
- Cycle 3: 1-4-9-6-1
- Cycle 4: 2-9-4-5-2
- Cycle 5: 2-9-6-1-2
- Cycle 6: 3-7-9-4-3
- Cycle 7: 3-7-5-2-3
- Cycle 8: 4-5-7-9-4
- Cycle 9: 5-7-3-2-5
- Cycle 10: 6-1-4-9-6
- Cycle 11: 6-2-9-4-6
- Cycle 12: 7-3-2-5-7
- Cycle 13: 7-9-4-5-7
- Cycle 14: 8-7-3-2-8
- Cycle 15: 9-4-1-6-9
- Cycle 16: 9-2-6-1-9

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
Out of the above cycles, only Cycle 5: 2-9-6-1-2 has exactly one chord (the edge 9-1).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [16].  

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <2, 9, 6, 1>.
