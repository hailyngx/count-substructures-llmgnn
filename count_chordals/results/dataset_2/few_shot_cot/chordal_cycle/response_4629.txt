Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 9, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 9, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 2, 4, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 3, 4, 0>
- Cycle 5: <3, 4, 9, 2, 3>
- Cycle 6: <3, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 7: <4, 8, 2, 4>
- Cycle 8: <6, 9, 4, 3, 6>
- Cycle 9: <6, 9, 7, 8, 6>
- Cycle 10: <6, 9, 2, 1, 6>
- Cycle 11: <0, 5, 7, 6, 0>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 6, 9, 4, 0>
    - Chord: (6, 4)
- <0, 6, 9, 7, 0>
    - Chord: (6, 7)
- <0, 1, 2, 4, 0>
    - Chord: (1, 4)
- <0, 1, 3, 4, 0>
    - Chord: (1, 3)
- <3, 4, 9, 2, 3>
    - Chord: (4, 9)
- <3, 4, 8, 3>
    - Chord: (4, 8)
- <4, 8, 2, 4>
    - Chord: (8, 2)
- <6, 9, 4, 3, 6>
    - Chord: (9, 3)
- <6, 9, 7, 8, 6>
    - Chord: (9, 8)
- <6, 9, 2, 1, 6>
    - Chord: (9, 1)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [5].
