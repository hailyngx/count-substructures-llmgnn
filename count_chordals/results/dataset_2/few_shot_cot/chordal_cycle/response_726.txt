Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <0, 3, 22, 16> with the non-adjacent chord being (0, 16).

Following the steps to find the number of chordal 4-cycles:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 3, 1, 29)
- Cycle 2: (0, 3, 22, 4)
- Cycle 3: (0, 3, 22, 6)
- Cycle 4: (0, 3, 22, 16)
- Cycle 5: (0, 16, 22, 3)
- Cycle 6: (0, 16, 22, 20)
- Cycle 7: (0, 16, 7, 14)
- Cycle 8: (3, 22, 20, 5)
- Cycle 9: (3, 22, 16, 0)
- Cycle 10: (3, 20, 22, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 22, 20, 5)
- Cycle 12: (6, 19, 11, 29)
- Cycle 13: (6, 19, 26, 28)
- Cycle 14: (6, 25, 4, 22)
- Cycle 15: (7, 14, 0, 3)
- Cycle 16: (7, 14, 21, 9)
- Cycle 17: (7, 16, 22, 4)
- Cycle 18: (8, 1, 29, 11)
- Cycle 19: (8, 5, 20, 22)
- Cycle 20: (8, 16, 22, 4)
- Cycle 21: (9, 27, 12, 2)
- Cycle 22: (9, 10, 29, 1)
- Cycle 23: (10, 18, 25, 6)
- Cycle 24: (11, 19, 26, 28)
- Cycle 25: (12, 27, 29, 1)
- Cycle 26: (14, 0, 16, 22)
- Cycle 27: (14, 7, 28, 26)
- Cycle 28: (16, 22, 4, 25)
- Cycle 29: (18, 25, 6, 19)
- Cycle 30: (20, 15, 22, 3)
- Cycle 31: (21, 17, 1, 29)
- Cycle 32: (23, 0, 16, 7)
- Cycle 33: (24, 28, 26, 19)
- Cycle 34: (25, 18, 10, 29)
- Cycle 35: (26, 19, 6, 27)
- Cycle 36: (27, 9, 21, 17)
- Cycle 37: (28, 26, 19, 11)
- Cycle 38: (29, 1, 3, 22)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle <0, 3, 22, 16> has one chord (0, 16).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found in the graph.

Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
