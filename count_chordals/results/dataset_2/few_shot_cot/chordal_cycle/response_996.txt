Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- <0, 7, 9, 5, 13, 0>
- <0, 7, 9, 5, 14, 0>
- <1, 9, 5, 13, 1>
- <1, 9, 5, 14, 1>
- <2, 9, 5, 13, 2>
- <2, 9, 5, 14, 2>
- <3, 9, 5, 13, 3>
- <3, 9, 5, 14, 3>
- <4, 13, 5, 9, 7, 4>
- <6, 2, 9, 5, 13, 6>
- <6, 2, 9, 5, 14, 6>
- <7, 12, 2, 9, 5, 13, 7>
- <7, 12, 2, 9, 5, 14, 7>
- <10, 3, 9, 5, 13, 10>
- <10, 3, 9, 5, 14, 10>
- <11, 12, 2, 9, 5, 13, 11>
- <11, 12, 2, 9, 5, 14, 11>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 7, 9, 5, 13, 0>  - Chord: (7, 5)
- <0, 7, 9, 5, 14, 0>  - Chord: (7, 5)
- <1, 9, 5, 13, 1>  - Chord: (9, 5)
- <1, 9, 5, 14, 1>  - Chord: (9, 5)
- <2, 9, 5, 13, 2>  - Chord: (9, 5)
- <2, 9, 5, 14, 2>  - Chord: (9, 5)
- <3, 9, 5, 13, 3>  - Chord: (9, 5)
- <3, 9, 5, 14, 3>  - Chord: (9, 5)
- <4, 13, 5, 9, 7, 4>  - Chord: (13, 9)
- <6, 2, 9, 5, 13, 6>  - Chord: (2, 5)
- <6, 2, 9, 5, 14, 6>  - Chord: (2, 5)
- <7, 12, 2, 9, 5, 13, 7>  - Chord: (12, 5)
- <7, 12, 2, 9, 5, 14, 7>  - Chord: (12, 5)
- <10, 3, 9, 5, 13, 10>  - Chord: (3, 5)
- <10, 3, 9, 5, 14, 10>  - Chord: (3, 5)
- <11, 12, 2, 9, 5, 13, 11>  - Chord: (12, 5)
- <11, 12, 2, 9, 5, 14, 11>  - Chord: (12, 5)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [15]
