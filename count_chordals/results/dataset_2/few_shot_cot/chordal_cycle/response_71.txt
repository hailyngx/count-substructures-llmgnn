- Cycle 2: <0, 25, 8, 6, 26> (length 5)
- Cycle 3: <0, 25, 8, 6, 26, 18> (length 6)
- Cycle 4: <0, 25, 8, 6, 26, 18, 2, 17> (length 8)
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 10, 21> (length 4)
- Cycle 6: <0, 9, 10, 21, 3, 27, 1, 11> (length 8)
- Cycle 7: <0, 9, 10, 21, 3, 24, 28, 29> (length 8)
- Cycle 8: <0, 9, 10, 21, 12, 27, 1, 11> (length 8)
- Cycle 9: <0, 24, 19, 15> (length 4)

- Cycle 14: <0, 22, 17, 29, 1, 11, 23> (length 7)
- Cycle 15: <0, 22, 17, 29, 4, 23, 20, 28> (length 8)
- Cycle 16: <1, 11, 7, 14> (length 4)
- Cycle 17: <1, 11, 23, 4, 29, 17, 22, 0> (length 8)
- Cycle 18: <1, 27, 3, 20> (length 4)
- Cycle 19: <1, 27, 3, 24, 19, 14, 12, 21> (length 8)

- Cycle 24: <3, 27, 5, 26> (length 4)
- Cycle 25: <3, 27, 1, 29> (length 4)
- Cycle 26: <3, 27, 12, 21> (length 4)
- Cycle 27: <4, 29, 17, 16> (length 4)
- Cycle 28: <5, 27, 12, 14> (length 4)
- Cycle 29: <6, 26, 18, 16> (length 4)
- Cycle 30: <7, 11, 23, 20> (length 4)
- Cycle 31: <8, 25, 0, 9> (length 4)
- Cycle 32: <15, 22, 17, 29> (length 4)
- Cycle 33: <19, 14, 7, 11> (length 4)
- Cycle 34: <24, 28, 20, 3> (length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord: 
- Among the cycles found, only the cycle <0, 22, 15, 19> has exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
