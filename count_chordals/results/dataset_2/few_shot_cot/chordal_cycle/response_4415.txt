Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0)

Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
First, we will list all cycles of length 4 in the graph:

1. <0, 4, 9, 1, 0>
2. <0, 4, 9, 7, 0>
3. <0, 1, 9, 4, 0>
4. <1, 9, 4, 7, 1>
5. <1, 9, 8, 4, 1>
6. <1, 4, 9, 7, 1>
7. <2, 6, 5, 7, 2>
8. <2, 6, 5, 7, 4>
9. <2, 6, 7, 5, 2>
10. <2, 6, 7, 4, 2>
11. <3, 8, 9, 4, 3>
12. <3, 8, 9, 1, 3>
13. <3, 8, 4, 9, 3>
14. <4, 9, 1, 7, 4>
15. <4, 9, 8, 1, 4>
16. <4, 9, 8, 3, 4>
17. <5, 6, 2, 1, 5>
18. <5, 7, 4, 1, 5>
19. <6, 7, 5, 2, 6>
20. <6, 7, 4, 2, 6>
21. <7, 9, 1, 4, 7>
22. <8, 9, 4, 1, 8>
23. <8, 9, 4, 3, 8>

Next, we will check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The chordless cycles are:
1. <0, 4, 9, 1, 0>
2. <0, 4, 9, 7, 0>
3. <0, 1, 9, 4, 0>
4. <1, 9, 4, 7, 1>
5. <1, 9, 8, 4, 1>
6. <1, 4, 9, 7, 1>
7. <2, 6, 5, 7, 2>
8. <2, 6, 5, 7, 4>
9. <2, 6, 7, 5, 2>
10. <2, 6, 7, 4, 2>
11. <3, 8, 9, 4, 3>
12. <3, 8, 9, 1, 3>
13. <3, 8, 4, 9, 3>
14. <4, 9, 1, 7, 4>
15. <4, 9, 8, 1, 4>
16. <4, 9, 8, 3, 4>
17. <5, 6, 2, 1, 5>
18. <5, 7, 4, 1, 5>
19. <6, 7, 5, 2, 6>
20. <6, 7, 4, 2, 6>
21. <7, 9, 1, 4, 7>
22. <8, 9, 4, 1, 8>
23. <8, 9, 4, 3, 8>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [23].
