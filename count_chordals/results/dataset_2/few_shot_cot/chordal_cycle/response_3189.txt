Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <5, 9, 7, 4>
- Cycle <5, 9, 1, 3>
- Cycle <5, 1, 3, 4>
- Cycle <5, 1, 2, 8>
- Cycle <5, 1, 9, 7>
- Cycle <5, 0, 4, 8>
- Cycle <9, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle <9, 7, 2, 1>
- Cycle <9, 1, 3, 7>
- Cycle <9, 1, 2, 8>
- Cycle <6, 2, 1, 5>
- Cycle <4, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle <4, 7, 2, 6>
- Cycle <4, 8, 2, 6>
- Cycle <7, 3, 1, 5>
- Cycle <7, 3, 2, 6>
- Cycle <1, 3, 4, 0>
- Cycle <1, 2, 4, 0>
- Cycle <3, 2, 4, 0>
- Cycle <8, 0, 4, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle <5, 9, 7, 4> has chord (5, 7)
- Cycle <5, 9, 1, 3> has chord (9, 1)
- Cycle <5, 1, 3, 4> has no chord
- Cycle <5, 1, 2, 8> has chord (1, 8)
- Cycle <5, 1, 9, 7> has chord (1, 7)
- Cycle <5, 0, 4, 8> has chord (0, 4)
- Cycle <9, 7, 4, 8> has no chord
- Cycle <9, 7, 2, 1> has chord (9, 1)
- Cycle <9, 1, 3, 7> has no chord
- Cycle <9, 1, 2, 8> has no chord
- Cycle <6, 2, 1, 5> has no chord
- Cycle <4, 7, 3, 1> has no chord
- Cycle <4, 7, 2, 6> has no chord
- Cycle <4, 8, 2, 6> has no chord
- Cycle <7, 3, 1, 5> has no chord
- Cycle <7, 3, 2, 6> has no chord
- Cycle <1, 3, 4, 0> has chord (3, 4)
- Cycle <1, 2, 4, 0> has no chord
- Cycle <3, 2, 4, 0> has chord (2, 4)
- Cycle <8, 0, 4, 3> has no chord

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found which are:
- Cycle <5, 1, 3, 4>
- Cycle <9, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle <9, 1, 3, 7>
- Cycle <9, 1, 2, 8>
- Cycle <6, 2, 1, 5>
- Cycle <4, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle <4, 7, 2, 6>
- Cycle <4, 8, 2, 6>
- Cycle <7, 3, 1, 5>
- Cycle <1, 2, 4, 0>
- Cycle <8, 0, 4, 3>

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
