Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 6, 22, 13, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 12, 9, 14, 0>
- Cycle 3: <8, 12, 9, 27, 15, 20, 1, 8>
- Cycle 4: <10, 14, 9, 27, 15, 20, 1, 11, 18, 16, 17, 25, 10>
- Cycle 5: <21, 5, 12, 8, 24, 21>
- Cycle 6: <26, 11, 1, 20, 15, 27, 3, 17, 26>
- Cycle 7: <28, 17, 3, 0, 5, 6, 22, 13, 27, 15, 20, 1, 11, 18, 16, 28>

Step 2: 
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: <5, 6, 22, 13, 5> with a chord (6, 13)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <0, 5, 12, 9, 14, 0> with a chord (5, 14)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <8, 12, 9, 27, 15, 20, 1, 8> with a chord (12, 27)
- Cycle 4 is chordal: <10, 14, 9, 27, 15, 20, 1, 11, 18, 16, 17, 25, 10> with chord (9, 20)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: <21, 5, 12, 8, 24, 21> with a chord (5, 24)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: <26, 11, 1, 20, 15, 27, 3, 17, 26> with a chord (1, 27)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <28, 17, 3, 0, 5, 6, 22, 13, 27, 15, 20, 1, 11, 18, 16, 28> with a chord (3, 20)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <10, 14, 9, 27, 15, 20, 1, 11, 18, 16, 17, 25, 10>.
