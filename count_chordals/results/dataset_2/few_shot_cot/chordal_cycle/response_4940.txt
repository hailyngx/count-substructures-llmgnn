Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <9, 26, 12, 6>. 

To count the number of chordless 4-cycles, we follow the steps provided:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <9, 26, 12, 6>
- Cycle 2: <9, 26, 7, 28>
- Cycle 3: <9, 5, 17, 11>
- Cycle 4: <9, 24, 19, 1>
- Cycle 5: <26, 7, 28, 2>
- Cycle 6: <26, 18, 20, 29>
- Cycle 7: <26, 12, 6, 13>
- Cycle 8: <5, 17, 2, 28>
- Cycle 9: <13, 6, 12, 26>
- Cycle 10: <13, 29, 20, 18>
- Cycle 11: <22, 1, 19, 24>
- Cycle 12: <23, 16, 2, 28>
- Cycle 13: <4, 27, 9, 5>
- Cycle 14: <15, 1, 19, 24>
- Cycle 15: <16, 2, 28, 7>
- Cycle 16: <17, 5, 9, 26>
- Cycle 17: <19, 24, 9, 27>
- Cycle 18: <20, 29, 13, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <9, 26, 12, 6> has one chord: (26, 12) 
- Cycle 2 <9, 26, 7, 28> has one chord: (26, 7)
- Cycle 7 <26, 12, 6, 13> has one chord: (12, 6)
- Cycle 9 <13, 6, 12, 26> has one chord: (6, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [14].
