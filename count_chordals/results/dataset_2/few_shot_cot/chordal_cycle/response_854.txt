Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

<5, 8, 7, 9> with chord (5, 7)
<5, 8, 2, 6> with chord (5, 2)
<5, 4, 1, 7> with chord (5, 1)
<5, 3, 9, 7> with chord (5, 9)
<4, 0, 1, 7> with chord (4, 1)
<4, 1, 2, 5> with chord (4, 2)
<4, 3, 8, 5> with chord (4, 8)
<8, 6, 7, 9> with chord (8, 7)
<8, 7, 1, 4> with chord (8, 1)
<2, 6, 7, 9> with chord (2, 7)

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
