Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 9, 5, 1) <(1, 9)>
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 9, 8, 1) <(1, 9)>
- Cycle 6: (1, 8, 4, 0, 3, 1) <(1, 4)>
- Cycle 7: (1, 8, 4, 0, 9, 3, 1) <(1, 9)>
- Cycle 10: (2, 3, 1, 7, 2) <(2, 7)>
- Cycle 11: (2, 3, 7, 1, 2) <(1, 7)>
- Cycle 12: (2, 3, 7, 8, 2) <(2, 8)>
- Cycle 13: (2, 6, 1, 7, 2) <(1, 7)>
- Cycle 14: (2, 6, 1, 3, 2) <(1, 3)>
- Cycle 16: (2, 6, 9, 3, 2) <(2, 9)>
