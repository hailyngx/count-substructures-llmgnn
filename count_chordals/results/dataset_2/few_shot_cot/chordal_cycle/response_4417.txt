Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 12) (4, 2) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 13) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 11) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (13, 7) (13, 14) (13, 1) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 12) (6, 14) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 11) (11, 7) (11, 0) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 12) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 2) (10, 7) (10, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 11, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 13, 8, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 12, 0, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 12, 14, 1, 10, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 12, 11, 10, 2, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 14, 11, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 7, and node 6
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 0, 14, 8, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 14, and node 1
Node 14 is connected to node 11, 6, 8, and node 13

Response:
Step 1: 
Some cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 0-5-9-12-7-2-0
- Cycle 0-5-9-12-6-14-13-1-8-3-0
- Cycle 0-11-7-12-6-14-13-1-8-0
- Cycle 1-5-9-12-7-13-14-6-1
- Cycle 2-5-9-12-7-13-14-6-4-2
- Cycle 3-0-5-9-12-7-13-14-6-3

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 5, 1, (13, 8), 3>
Note: The chord here is the edge connecting nodes 13 and 8.

Step 3:
There is [1] chordless 4-cycle found in the graph.
