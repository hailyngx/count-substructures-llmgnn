Step 2: 

Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 1, 2, 8, (6, 0)>
- <0, 1, 2, 13, (4, 0)>
- <0, 1, 9, 12, (5, 0)>

- <5, 14, 12, 9, (1, 5)>
- <6, 11, 5, 12, (9, 6)>
- <6, 8, 2, 1, (9, 6)>
- <6, 8, 11, 5, (0, 6)>
- <6, 8, 11, 2, (13, 6)>
- Total chordal 4-cycles found: 13

Step 3:

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [46-13] = [33].
