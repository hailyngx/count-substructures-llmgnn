Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle <0, 6, 4, 7> with edges (0, 6), (6, 4), (4, 7), (7, 0) 
- Cycle <0, 6, 12, 2> with edges (0, 6), (6, 12), (12, 2), (2, 0) 
- Cycle <2, 12, 8, 13> with edges (2, 12), (12, 8), (8, 13), (13, 2) 
- Cycle <3, 7, 4, 13> with edges (3, 7), (7, 4), (4, 13), (13, 3) 
- Cycle <5, 7, 13, 8> with edges (5, 7), (7, 13), (13, 8), (8, 5) 
- Cycle <9, 13, 8, 12> with edges (9, 13), (13, 8), (8, 12), (12, 9) 
- Cycle <11, 3, 7, 4> with edges (11, 3), (3, 7), (7, 4), (4, 11) 
- Cycle <11, 3, 14, 12> with edges (11, 3), (3, 14), (14, 12), (12, 11) 
- Cycle <11, 9, 13, 4> with edges (11, 9), (9, 13), (13, 4), (4, 11) 
- Cycle <14, 3, 7, 10> with edges (14, 3), (3, 7), (7, 10), (10, 14) 
- Cycle <14, 12, 8, 13> with edges (14, 12), (12, 8), (8, 13), (13, 14) 
- Cycle <0, 10, 7, 13> with edges (0, 10), (10, 7), (7, 13), (13, 0) 

Step 2: 
Checking for a single chord in each cycle:
- The cycle <0, 6, 4, 7> has a chord (6, 7)
- The cycle <0, 6, 12, 2> has a chord (6, 12)
- The cycle <2, 12, 8, 13> has a chord (12, 8)
- The cycle <3, 7, 4, 13> has a chord (7, 13)
- The cycle <5, 7, 13, 8> has a chord (5, 8)
- The cycle <9, 13, 8, 12> has a chord (13, 8)
- The cycle <11, 3, 7, 4> has a chord (3, 4)
- The cycle <11, 3, 14, 12> has a chord (3, 12)
- The cycle <11, 9, 13, 4> has a chord (9, 13)
- The cycle <14, 3, 7, 10> has a chord (3, 7)
- The cycle <14, 12, 8, 13> has a chord (12, 8)
- The cycle <0, 10, 7, 13> has a chord (10, 7)

Step 3: 
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [12]
