Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 2, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all edges existing:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-9-5-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-4-5-8-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-5-8-0
- Cycle 4: 0-2-3-6-0
- Cycle 5: 1-4-6-3-2-1
- Cycle 6: 1-4-5-7-1
- Cycle 7: 2-3-6-4-2
- Cycle 8: 2-5-4-7-2
- Cycle 9: 3-6-9-5-3
- Cycle 10: 4-5-9-6-4
- Cycle 11: 4-7-5-9-4
- Cycle 12: 5-7-4-8-5
- Cycle 13: 6-9-5-8-6

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 1, 4, 5> with chord (1, 4)
- <0, 2, 5, 8> with chord (2, 8)
- <1, 4, 5, 7> with chord (1, 7)
- <2, 3, 6, 4> with chord (3, 6)

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
