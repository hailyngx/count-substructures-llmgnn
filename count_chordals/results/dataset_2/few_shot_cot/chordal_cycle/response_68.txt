Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 8, 10, 13, 11> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 12, 14, 11> 
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 4, 7, 11> 
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 3, 6, 4> 
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 4, 7, 11> 
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 11, 14, 12> 
- Cycle 7: <2, 7, 4, 3, 6> 
- Cycle 8: <2, 7, 11, 14, 12> 
- Cycle 9: <2, 12, 1, 9, 4> 
- Cycle 10: <2, 12, 14, 11, 7> 
- Cycle 11: <3, 1, 9, 7, 4> 
- Cycle 12: <3, 1, 13, 11, 9> 
- Cycle 13: <3, 6, 4, 7, 11> 
- Cycle 14: <4, 3, 6, 7, 9> 
- Cycle 15: <5, 0, 13, 11, 14> 
- Cycle 16: <5, 8, 10, 14, 12> 
- Cycle 17: <5, 12, 1, 9, 3> 
- Cycle 18: <7, 4, 6, 3, 9> 
- Cycle 19: <8, 5, 12, 14, 10> 
- Cycle 20: <10, 8, 5, 0, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 9, 3, 6> (Chord: (4, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 9, 4, 7> (Chord: (3, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, 7, 11, 14> (Chord: (4, 3))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are [17] chordless cycles.
