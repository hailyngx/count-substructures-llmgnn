Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 6, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 1, 9>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 1, 9>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 4, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 5, 6, 7>
- Cycle 6: <2, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 7: <2, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 8: <2, 7, 8, 9>
- Cycle 9: <6, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 10: <6, 7, 8, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- From Cycle 1, the chord <5, 7> forms the chordal 4-cycle <0, 5, (7, 6), 6> 
- From Cycle 2, the chord <4, 9> forms the chordal 4-cycle <0, 4, (9, 1), 1>
- From Cycle 3, the chord <3, 9> forms the chordal 4-cycle <0, 3, (9, 1), 1>
- From Cycle 4, the chord <3, 1> forms the chordal 4-cycle <0, 3, (1, 4), 4>
- From Cycle 5, the chord <5, 6> forms the chordal 4-cycle <2, 5, (6, 7), 7>
- From Cycle 6, the chord <5, 9> forms the chordal 4-cycle <2, 5, (9, 8), 8>
- From Cycle 7, the chord <5, 6> forms the chordal 4-cycle <2, 5, (6, 7), 7>
- From Cycle 8, the chord <7, 8> forms the chordal 4-cycle <2, 7, (8, 9), 9>
- From Cycle 9, the chord <5, 9> forms the chordal 4-cycle <6, 5, (9, 8), 8>
- From Cycle 10, the chord <7, 8> forms the chordal 4-cycle <6, 7, (8, 9), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [10] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
