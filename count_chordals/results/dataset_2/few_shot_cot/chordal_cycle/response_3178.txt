- Cycle 2 has one chord: (1, 19)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (4, 14)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (4, 13)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (5, 11)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (4, 13)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (9, 17)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (0, 2)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (11, 14)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (4, 13)
- Cycle 12 has no chords
- Cycle 13 has no chords
- Cycle 14 has no chords
- Cycle 15 has one chord: (7, 12)
- Cycle 16 has one chord: (4, 14)
- Cycle 17 has one chord: (8, 18)
- Cycle 18 has one chord: (16, 12)
- Cycle 19 has one chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 20 has one chord: (1, 19)

Step 3:

- <1, (1, 19), 13, 4, 1>
- <1, (4, 14), 14, 6, 1>
- <1, (4, 13), 18, 9, 1>
- <1, (5, 11), 11, 2, 1>
- <2, (4, 13), 14, 6, 2>
- <2, (6, 9), 9, 17, 2>
- <3, (0, 2), 5, 11, 3>
- <5, (11, 14), 14, 3, 5>
- <7, (7, 12), 16, 2, 7>
