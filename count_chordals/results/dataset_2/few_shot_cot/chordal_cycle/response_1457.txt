Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 5, 18, 15, 3> (Chord: (1, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 26, 19, 21, 25> (Chord: (19, 21))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, 5, 18, 22, 15> (Chord: (5, 22))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, 11, 28, 19, 26> (Chord: (11, 28))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, 15, 22, 7, 16> (Chord: (15, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, 24, 14, 26, 1> (Chord: (24, 26))
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <10, 3, 15, 22, 17> (Chord: (3, 22))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 90 cycles found in total, and 7 of them are chordal 4-cycles.
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is 90 - 7 = [83].
