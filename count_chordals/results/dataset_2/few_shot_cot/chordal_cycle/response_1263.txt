- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 18, (16, 29)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 0, (22, 16)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 13, (8, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 15, (17, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 15, (26, 24)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 19, (7, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <14, 27, (11, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <15, 26, (11, 18)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <26, 5, (15, 17)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <26, 11, (18, 10)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <27, 20, (1, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <29, 13, (8, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <29, 16, (22, 0)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
