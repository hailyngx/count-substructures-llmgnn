Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 14, 9, 8, 2> with chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 14, 10, 5, 3> with chord (4, 5)
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 12, 6, 13, 5> with chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 13, 5, 3, 2> with chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 13, 10, 7, 4> with chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 6: <0, 11, 2, 8, 9, 14> with chord (11, 9)
- Cycle 7: <2, 3, 12, 6, 11, 13> with chord (3, 11)
- Cycle 8: <4, 7, 6, 12, 2, 8> with chord (7, 2)
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 10, 5, 13, 6> with chord (7, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- The cycles with exactly one chord are: Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, Cycle 4, Cycle 5, Cycle 6, Cycle 7, Cycle 8, and Cycle 9.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

- There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
