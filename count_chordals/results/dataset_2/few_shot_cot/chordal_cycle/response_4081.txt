Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 3, 15, 5> (Chord: 15)
<0, 14, 19, 5> (Chord: 14)
<0, 8, 11, 1> (Chord: 11)
<1, 6, 13, 19> (Chord: 6)
<2, 16, 14, 17> (Chord: 14)
<2, 19, 14, 16> (Chord: 14)
<4, 16, 14, 17> (Chord: 16)
<13, 19, 14, 17> (Chord: 14)

Step 3:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [8].
