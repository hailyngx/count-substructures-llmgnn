Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle <0, 11, 13, 4>
- Cycle <0, 11, 12, 1>
- Cycle <0, 12, 14, 13>
- Cycle <0, 12, 14, 8>
- Cycle <1, 12, 14, 13>
- Cycle <2, 9, 4, 7>
- Cycle <3, 13, 4, 7>
- Cycle <3, 13, 11, 12>
- Cycle <4, 13, 2, 9>
- Cycle <5, 14, 3, 10>
- Cycle <6, 0, 8, 7>
- Cycle <7, 8, 10, 11>
- Cycle <8, 14, 12, 1>
- Cycle <9, 2, 13, 4>
- Cycle <10, 5, 9, 4>
- Cycle <11, 7, 4, 13>
- Cycle <12, 1, 7, 4>
- Cycle <13, 4, 9, 2>
- Cycle <14, 5, 9, 2>

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - Cycle <0, 11, 13, 4> has a chord (11, 13) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <0, 11, 12, 1> has a chord (11, 12) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <0, 12, 14, 13> has a chord (12, 13) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <0, 12, 14, 8> has a chord (12, 14) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <1, 12, 14, 13> has a chord (12, 14) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <2, 9, 4, 7> has a chord (9, 4) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <3, 13, 4, 7> has a chord (13, 4) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <3, 13, 11, 12> has a chord (13, 11) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <4, 13, 2, 9> has a chord (13, 9) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <5, 14, 3, 10> has a chord (14, 3) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <6, 0, 8, 7> has a chord (0, 8) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <7, 8, 10, 11> has a chord (8, 10) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <8, 14, 12, 1> has a chord (14, 12) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <9, 2, 13, 4> has a chord (13, 4) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <10, 5, 9, 4> has a chord (5, 9) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <11, 7, 4, 13> has a chord (7, 13) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <12, 1, 7, 4> has a chord (1, 7) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <13, 4, 9, 2> has a chord (4, 9) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
    - Cycle <14, 5, 9, 2> has a chord (5, 9) making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Hence, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [19].
