Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <1, (21, 11), 29>.

Following the steps mentioned earlier:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more
- Cycle 1: 1-21-5-22-1 (chord: 21-11)
- Cycle 2: 1-22-5-21-1 (chord: 22-29)
- Cycle 3: 1-21-11-29-1 (chord: 21-5)
- Cycle 4: 22-5-21-11-22 (chord: 5-17)
- Cycle 5: 22-1-21-11-22 (chord: 1-29)
- Cycle 6: 21-5-17-3-21 (chord: 5-22)
- Cycle 7: 21-1-22-29-21 (chord: 1-5)
- Cycle 8: 21-11-29-9-21 (chord: 11-1)
- Cycle 9: 5-22-1-21-5 (chord: 22-6)
- Cycle 10: 11-21-1-22-11 (chord: 21-29)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord
- The cycle <1, (21, 11), 29> is the only chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found
- There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
