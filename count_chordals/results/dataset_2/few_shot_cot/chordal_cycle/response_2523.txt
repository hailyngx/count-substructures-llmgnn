Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 0) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 14) (4, 11) (7, 4) (7, 8) (10, 0) (10, 13) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 5) (11, 4) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 0) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 1) (6, 5) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 8) (3, 11) (3, 12) (3, 13) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 6) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 8) (13, 9) (13, 10) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 3)

Node 14 is connected to node 4, 10, 0, 6, 8, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 2, 10, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 14, 4, 7, 8, 14, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 13, 9, 1, 14, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 13, 3, 8, 6, 14, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 1, 8, 3, 13, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 13, 12, 3, 8, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 9, 13, 0, 14, 4, 11, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 6, 8, 3, 11, 2>
- Cycle 9: <3, 11, 4, 14, 10, 13, 3>
- Cycle 10: <4, 7, 8, 3, 12, 13, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 14, 10, 2, 5, 11, 4>
- Cycle 12: <5, 6, 14, 8, 1, 9, 5>
- Cycle 13: <6, 5, 0, 9, 13, 3, 12, 6>
- Cycle 14: <7, 4, 11, 3, 8, 14, 10, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 4 <0, 14, 4, 7, 8, 14, 0> has exactly one chord, which is edge (4, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [13].
