Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 17, 13, 15)
- Cycle 2: (0, 17, 13, 15, 19)
- Cycle 3: (0, 17, 13, 15, 8, 12)
- Cycle 4: (0, 17, 13, 15, 19, 14, 1)
- Cycle 5: (0, 17, 13, 15, 19, 14, 9)
- Cycle 6: (0, 3, 1, 14)
- Cycle 7: (0, 3, 5, 9)
- Cycle 8: (0, 3, 5, 10, 6)
- Cycle 9: (0, 4, 2, 11)
- Cycle 10: (0, 4, 2, 19, 15)
- Cycle 11: (0, 4, 16, 12, 8, 15)
- Cycle 12: (0, 4, 16, 9, 5)
- Cycle 13: (0, 16, 12, 8, 15, 19)
- Cycle 14: (1, 14, 9, 5)
- Cycle 15: (1, 14, 9, 16, 12)
- Cycle 16: (1, 14, 19, 15, 13)
- Cycle 17: (2, 19, 15, 13)
- Cycle 18: (2, 19, 15, 8, 12)
- Cycle 19: (4, 16, 9, 5)
- Cycle 20: (4, 16, 9, 14)
- Cycle 21: (4, 16, 12, 8, 15)
- Cycle 22: (9, 14, 19, 15, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 14 (<1, 14, 9, 5>) has exactly one chord: (1, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
There is 21 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [21].
