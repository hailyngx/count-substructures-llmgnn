Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle <0, 5, 7, 1, 3> of length 4
2. Cycle <0, 5, 8, 2, 6> of length 4
3. Cycle <0, 5, 9, 4, 6> of length 4
4. Cycle <1, 3, 4, 9, 7> of length 4
5. Cycle <1, 7, 5, 8, 2> of length 4
6. Cycle <2, 5, 9, 4, 6> of length 4
7. Cycle <3, 4, 9, 5, 8> of length 4
8. Cycle <3, 5, 9, 4, 6> of length 4
9. Cycle <5, 7, 6, 4, 3> of length 4
10. Cycle <5, 8, 6, 4, 3> of length 4
11. Cycle <5, 9, 4, 3, 0> of length 4
12. Cycle <5, 9, 7, 6, 4> of length 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Chordal 4-cycle <0, 5, 7, 1, 3>, chord: (5, 1)
2. Chordal 4-cycle <0, 5, 9, 4, 6>, chord: (5, 4)
3. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 3, 4, 9, 7>, chord: (3, 9)
4. Chordal 4-cycle <2, 5, 9, 4, 6>, chord: (5, 4)
5. Chordal 4-cycle <5, 7, 6, 4, 3>, chord: (7, 4)
6. Chordal 4-cycle <5, 8, 6, 4, 3>, chord: (5, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the answer is [6].
