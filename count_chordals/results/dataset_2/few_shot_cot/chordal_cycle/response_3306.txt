Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Found cycle <0, 3, 14, 4> of length 4.
- Found cycle <0, 3, 11, 9> of length 4.
- Found cycle <0, 2, 7, 4> of length 4.
- Found cycle <1, 8, 14, 4> of length 4.
- Found cycle <1, 11, 0, 3> of length 4.
- Found cycle <1, 13, 2, 7> of length 4.
- Found cycle <1, 10, 5, 9> of length 4.
- Found cycle <2, 7, 4, 14> of length 4.
- Found cycle <2, 13, 1, 8> of length 4.
- Found cycle <2, 0, 3, 11> of length 4.
- Found cycle <3, 14, 4, 7> of length 4.
- Found cycle <3, 11, 9, 5> of length 4.
- Found cycle <4, 14, 8, 1> of length 4.
- Found cycle <5, 9, 13, 7> of length 4.
- Found cycle <9, 11, 3, 0> of length 4.
- Found cycle <9, 13, 1, 8> of length 4.
- Found cycle <10, 5, 9, 11> of length 4.
- Found cycle <10, 8, 14, 4> of length 4.
- Found cycle <11, 3, 14, 4> of length 4.
- Found cycle <13, 7, 4, 14> of length 4.

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Found chordal 4-cycle <0, 2, 7, 4> with chord (0, 7).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
