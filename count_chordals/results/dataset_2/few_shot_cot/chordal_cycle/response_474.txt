Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-6-9-2-5
- Cycle 2: 5-1-4-7-5
- Cycle 3: 5-3-8-6-5
- Cycle 4: 6-0-9-2-6
- Cycle 5: 6-1-8-3-6
- Cycle 6: 6-4-7-5-6
- Cycle 7: 6-8-0-6

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: 5-6-9-2-5, chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 2: 5-1-4-7-5, chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 3: 5-3-8-6-5, chord: (3, 8)
- Cycle 4: 6-0-9-2-6, chord: (0, 9)
- Cycle 5: 6-1-8-3-6, chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 6: 6-4-7-5-6, chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 7: 6-8-0-6, chord: (0, 8)

Step 3:
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found. 

Therefore, the final answer is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <5, (6, 9), 2, 5>
- <5, (1, 4), 7, 5>
- <5, (3, 8), 6, 5>
- <6, (0, 9), 2, 6>
- <6, (1, 8), 3, 6>
- <6, (4, 7), 5, 6>
- <6, (0, 8), 6>
