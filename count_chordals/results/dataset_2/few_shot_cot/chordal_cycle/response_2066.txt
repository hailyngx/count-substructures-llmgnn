Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 4, 11, 1>
- <0, 4, 8, 7>
- <0, 2, 5, 11>
- <0, 2, 10, 3>
- <0, 12, 7, 8>
- <1, 10, 2, 6>
- <1, 14, 9, 12>
- <2, 6, 9, 12>
- <2, 6, 13, 3>
- <2, 10, 4, 8>
- <3, 7, 6, 9>
- <4, 8, 5, 11>
- <4, 8, 7, 12>
- <5, 8, 4, 0>
- <6, 9, 14, 1>
- <7, 12, 11, 4>
- <10, 3, 13, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 11, 1> has chord (4, 1)
- <0, 4, 8, 7> has chord (4, 8)
- <0, 2, 5, 11> has chord (5, 11)
- <0, 2, 10, 3> has chord (10, 3)
- <0, 12, 7, 8> has chord (7, 8)
- <1, 14, 9, 12> has chord (9, 12)
- <2, 6, 9, 12> has chord (9, 12)
- <2, 10, 4, 8> has chord (4, 8)
- <3, 7, 6, 9> has chord (6, 9)
- no chords in the remaining cycles

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [7]

The unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, 4, 11, 1>
- <0, 4, 8, 7>
- <0, 2, 5, 11>
- <0, 2, 10, 3>
- <0, 12, 7, 8>
- <1, 14, 9, 12>
- <2, 6, 9, 12>
