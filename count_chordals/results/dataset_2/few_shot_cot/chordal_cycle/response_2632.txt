Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 8, 4, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 2, 9, 7>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 7, 9, 6>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle 5: <2, 6, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 6: <2, 6, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 9, 7, 5>
- Cycle 8: <2, 6, 9, 3, 0>
- Cycle 9: <3, 9, 7, 5, 6>
- Cycle 10: <3, 9, 6, 4, 7>
- Cycle 11: <4, 6, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 12: <5, 7, 4, 8, 5>
- Cycle 13: <8, 4, 1, 7, 5>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord <3, 8>
- Cycle 2 has one chord <2, 9>
- Cycle 3 has one chord <4, 9>
- Cycle 4 has one chord <7, 9>
- Cycle 5 has one chord <6, 7>
- Cycle 6 has one chord <4, 8>
- Cycle 7 has one chord <6, 9>
- Cycle 8 has one chord <3, 0>
- Cycle 9 has one chord <5, 6>
- Cycle 10 has no chord
- Cycle 11 has one chord <6, 7>
- Cycle 12 has one chord <4, 8>
- Cycle 13 has one chord <1, 7>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the final result is [1].
