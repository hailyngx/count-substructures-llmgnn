Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:

1. Cycle: 1 - 4 - 2 - 9 - 1
2. Cycle: 1 - 4 - 6 - 9 - 1
3. Cycle: 1 - 4 - 3 - 6 - 1
4. Cycle: 1 - 8 - 2 - 9 - 1
5. Cycle: 1 - 8 - 0 - 9 - 1
6. Cycle: 1 - 8 - 2 - 4 - 1
7. Cycle: 1 - 6 - 9 - 5 - 1
8. Cycle: 1 - 6 - 3 - 4 - 1
9. Cycle: 1 - 6 - 9 - 7 - 1
10. Cycle: 1 - 4 - 6 - 9 - 5 - 1
11. Cycle: 1 - 8 - 2 - 9 - 7 - 1
12. Cycle: 1 - 8 - 0 - 9 - 7 - 1
13. Cycle: 1 - 8 - 2 - 4 - 6 - 1
14. Cycle: 1 - 6 - 9 - 5 - 7 - 1

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:

1. <1, (2, 9), 4, 1>
2. <1, (2, 4), 6, 1>
3. <1, (3, 6), 4, 1>
4. <1, (2, 9), 8, 1>
5. <1, (0, 9), 8, 1>
6. <1, (2, 4), 8, 1>
7. <1, (5, 9), 6, 1>
8. <1, (3, 4), 6, 1>
9. <1, (7, 9), 6, 1>
10. <1, (5, 9), 6, 4>
11. <1, (2, 9), 8, 7>
12. <1, (0, 9), 8, 7>
13. <1, (2, 4), 6, 8>
14. <1, (5, 9), 7, 6>

Step 3: 
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [14].
