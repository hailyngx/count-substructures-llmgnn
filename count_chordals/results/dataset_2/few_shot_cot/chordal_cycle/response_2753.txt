Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - The cycles in this graph are:
            - Cycle 1: <0, 3, 1, 2, 5, 4>
            - Cycle 2: <0, 3, 1, 13, 9, 2>
            - Cycle 3: <0, 3, 7, 9, 2, 10>
            - Cycle 4: <0, 3, 13, 12, 14, 11>
            - Cycle 5: <0, 3, 7, 9, 6, 4>
            - Cycle 6: <0, 3, 13, 9, 6, 8>
            - Cycle 7: <0, 6, 4, 5, 2, 10>
            - Cycle 8: <0, 6, 4, 5, 11, 14>
            - Cycle 9: <1, 3, 13, 12, 14, 11>
            - Cycle 10: <1, 3, 7, 9, 2, 10>
            - Cycle 11: <1, 3, 13, 9, 6, 8>
            - Cycle 12: <1, 3, 0, 6, 9, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Checking the cycles for a unique chord:
            - <0, 3, 1, 2, 5, 4> has a chord (1, 5)
            - <0, 3, 1, 13, 9, 2> has a chord (1, 9)
            - <0, 3, 7, 9, 2, 10> has a chord (2, 10)
            - <0, 3, 13, 9, 6, 8> has a chord (9, 6)
            - <0, 6, 4, 5, 2, 10> has a chord (4, 10)
            - <0, 6, 4, 5, 11, 14> has a chord (5, 14)
            - <1, 3, 13, 12, 14, 11> has a chord (13, 12)
            - <1, 3, 7, 9, 2, 10> has a chord (7, 2)
            - <1, 3, 13, 9, 6, 8> has a chord (3, 6)
            - <1, 3, 0, 6, 9, 7> has a chord (3, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There are [0] chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
