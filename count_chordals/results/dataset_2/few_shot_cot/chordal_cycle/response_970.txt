- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 1, 6, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 5, 7, 8, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 9, 5, 1, 3>
- Cycle 11: <3, 9, 6, 1, 3>
- Cycle 12: <3, 9, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 13: <7, 5, 9, 3, 7>
- Cycle 14: <7, 5, 1, 8, 7>
- Cycle 15: <7, 5, 9, 1, 7>
- Cycle 16: <7, 0, 4, 6, 7>
- Cycle 17: <7, 0, 8, 5, 7>
- Cycle 18: <7, 0, 8, 1, 7>
- Cycle 19: <8, 5, 9, 1, 8>
- Cycle 20: <8, 5, 1, 3, 8>
- Cycle 21: <8, 5, 7, 0, 8>
- Cycle 22: <8, 1, 5, 9, 8>
- Cycle 23: <8, 1, 5, 3, 8>
- Cycle 24: <8, 1, 6, 3, 8>
- Cycle 25: <8, 3, 5, 9, 8>
- Cycle 26: <8, 3, 5, 1, 8>
- Cycle 27: <8, 3, 1, 6, 8>
- Cycle 28: <8, 7, 5, 9, 8>
- Cycle 29: <8, 7, 5, 1, 8>
- Cycle 30: <8, 7, 0, 4, 8>
- Cycle 31: <0, 4, 6, 9, 0>
- Cycle 32: <0, 4, 6, 1, 0>
- Cycle 33: <0, 4, 2, 8, 0>
- Cycle 34: <0, 7, 5, 9, 0>
- Cycle 35: <0, 7, 5, 1, 0>
- Cycle 36: <0, 7, 8, 5, 0>

Step 2: Checking for unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 5, 9, 6> has a chord (1, 6)
- <1, 9, 5, 3> has a chord (1, 3)
- <1, 9, 6, 3> has a chord (1, 3)
- <3, 5, 9, 6> has a chord (3, 6)
- <3, 9, 5, 1> has a chord (3, 1)
- <3, 9, 6, 1> has a chord (3, 1)
- <7, 5, 9, 3> has a chord (7, 3)
- <8, 5, 7, 0> has a chord (8, 7)
- <8, 1, 6, 3> has a chord (1, 3)
- <0, 4, 6, 9> has a chord (0, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
