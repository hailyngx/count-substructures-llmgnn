Step 2: Check for chords in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 6, 14, 10> (Chord: (14, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 11, 4, 13> (Chord: (4, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 5, 7, 9> (Chord: (7, 5))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 9, 12, 1> (Chord: (1, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 7, 5, 1> (Chord: (7, 5))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 7, 2, 8> (Chord: (2, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 11, 5, 1> (Chord: (5, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <13, 4, 11, 0> (Chord: (4, 0))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [8] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
