Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (0, 6, 2, 4, 5, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 6, 8, 7, 5, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 9, 3, 4, 5, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 9, 7, 5, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (6, 8).
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has a chord (9, 7).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
Since there are 2 cycles with exactly one chord, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles is [2].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (6, 8), 2, 4, 5>
- <1, (9, 7), 3, 4, 5>
