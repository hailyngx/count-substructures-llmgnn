Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <1, 9, 15, 19> with chord (1, 15)
2. <1, 5, 13, 2> with chord (1, 13)
3. <1, 19, 11, 5> with chord (1, 11)
4. <1, 8, 3, 16> with chord (1, 3)
5. <2, 7, 18, 15> with chord (2, 18)
6. <2, 11, 19, 14> with chord (2, 19)
7. <3, 8, 1, 15> with chord (3, 1)
8. <\textcolor{blue}{4, 12, 17, 5}> with chord <\textcolor{red}{4, 17}>
9. <5, 14, 19, 11> with chord (5, 19)
10. <5, 13, 2, 11> with chord (5, 11)

Step 3: 
There are a total of 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
