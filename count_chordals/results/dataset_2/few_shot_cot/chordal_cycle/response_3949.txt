Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 5, 8> with edges (0, 3), (3, 5), (5, 8), (8, 0)
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 5, 8> with edges (1, 3), (3, 5), (5, 8), (8, 1)
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 7, 8> with edges (1, 4), (4, 7), (7, 8), (8, 1)
- Cycle 4: <3, 5, 7, 1> with edges (3, 5), (5, 7), (7, 1), (1, 3)
- Cycle 5: <3, 7, 8, 1> with edges (3, 7), (7, 8), (8, 1), (1, 3)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord:
- <1, 4, 7, 8> has chord (4, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
- As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
