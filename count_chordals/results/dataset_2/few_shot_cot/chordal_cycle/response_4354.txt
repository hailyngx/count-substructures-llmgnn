Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- There is one unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 1, 5, 8>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
