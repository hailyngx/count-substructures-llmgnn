Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 4, 7, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 2, 8, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 6, 1, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 7, 2, 8, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 1, 6, 3, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 3, 9, 3, 0>
- Cycle 8: <1, 6, 7, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 6, 3, 8, 1>
- Cycle 10: <2, 5, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 2>
- Cycle 11: <2, 5, 4, 8, 1, 6, 7, 2>
- Cycle 12: <2, 5, 2>
- Cycle 13: <3, 9, 3>
- Cycle 14: <4, 5, 7, 6, 1, 8, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 5, (4, 8), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 7, (6, 1), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 7, (2, 8), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are a total of [11] chordless cycles in the given graph.
