Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 9, 13, 4>
- <0, 4, 5, 8>
- <0, 2, 14, 10>
- <1, 7, 11, 6>
- <1, 7, 14, 10>
- <1, 12, 6, 10>
- <2, 4, 8, 5>
- <2, 4, 13, 6>
- <2, 8, 12, 6>
- <2, 8, 11, 5>
- <2, 14, 7, 11>
- <2, 14, 10, 1>
- <3, 5, 8, 11>
- <3, 5, 4, 13>
- <3, 14, 7, 11>
- <4, 8, 12, 6>
- <4, 8, 11, 5>
- <4, 13, 6, 10>
- <5, 8, 12, 6>
- <5, 8, 11, 7>
- <6, 12, 8, 5>
- <6, 12, 1, 10>
- <6, 11, 7, 14>
- <6, 11, 13, 9>
- <6, 13, 4, 2>
- <7, 11, 8, 5>
- <7, 11, 6, 12>
- <7, 11, 13, 10>
- <7, 14, 3, 5>
- <8, 12, 6, 13>
- <8, 11, 5, 3>
- <8, 11, 7, 14>
- <10, 1, 12, 8>
- <10, 1, 7, 14>
- <10, 1, 6, 13>
- <10, 14, 7, 11>
- <11, 5, 4, 2>
- <11, 5, 8, 12>
- <11, 6, 12, 8>
- <11, 6, 13, 4>
- <11, 7, 14, 3>
- <12, 8, 5, 3>
- <12, 8, 11, 7>
- <12, 6, 13, 4>
- <12, 1, 10, 14>
- <13, 9, 0, 2>
- <13, 9, 4, 5>
- <13, 6, 12, 8>
- <13, 6, 11, 7>
- <13, 10, 1, 7>
- <14, 7, 11, 5>
- <14, 7, 1, 12>
- <14, 3, 5, 8>
- <14, 10, 1, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 2, 14, 10> has chord (2, 14)
- <3, 5, 8, 11> has chord (5, 8)
- <3, 14, 7, 11> has chord (14, 7)
- <6, 12, 1, 10> has chord (12, 1)
- <8, 12, 6, 13> has chord (12, 6)
- <10, 1, 12, 8> has chord (1, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [52].
