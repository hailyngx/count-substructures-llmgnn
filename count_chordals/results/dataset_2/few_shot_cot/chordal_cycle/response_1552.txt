Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- (1, 14, 7, 2, 1)
- (3, 0, 10, 11, 3)
- (5, 1, 14, 3, 5)
- (5, 1, 13, 12, 5)
- (5, 1, 7, 13, 5)
- (6, 3, 0, 10, 6)
- (6, 3, 9, 7, 6)
- (6, 5, 12, 13, 6)
- (6, 8, 4, 12, 6)
- (6, 8, 11, 2, 6)
- (7, 1, 14, 6, 7)
- (8, 11, 4, 12, 8)
- (8, 11, 2, 7, 8)
- (9, 3, 0, 10, 9)
- (10, 0, 2, 11, 10)
- (12, 10, 0, 3, 12)
- (12, 10, 11, 8, 12)
- (13, 1, 14, 3, 13)
- (13, 1, 7, 9, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:  
- <1, (14, 7), 2, 1>
- <5, (1, 13), 12, 5>
- <6, (8, 11), 2, 6>
- <8, (11, 4), 12, 8>
- <10, (0, 2), 11, 10>
- <12, (10, 0), 3, 12>
- <13, (1, 7), 9, 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:  
- Number of unique chordal 4-cycles = [7]
