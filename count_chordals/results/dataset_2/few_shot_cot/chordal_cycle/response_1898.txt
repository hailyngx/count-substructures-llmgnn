Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (0, 13, 8, 12)
- Cycle 2: (0, 13, 3, 11)
- Cycle 3: (0, 13, 9, 1)
- Cycle 4: (0, 14, 9, 1)
- Cycle 5: (0, 7, 8, 12)
- Cycle 6: (0, 7, 3, 11)
- Cycle 7: (1, 13, 3, 11)
- Cycle 8: (1, 13, 9, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 11, 3, 13)
- Cycle 10: (3, 13, 5, 12)

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a unique chord (0, 12)
- Cycle 2 does not have a chord
- Cycle 3 does not have a chord
- Cycle 4 does not have a chord
- Cycle 5 has a unique chord (0, 7)
- Cycle 6 does not have a chord
- Cycle 7 does not have a chord
- Cycle 8 does not have a chord
- Cycle 9 has a unique chord (1, 13)
- Cycle 10 has a unique chord (3, 12)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, 13, 8, 12> with a chord (0, 12)
2. <0, 7, 8, 12> with a chord (0, 7)
3. <1, 11, 3, 13> with a chord (1, 13)
