<1, (17, 10), 6>
<1, (17, 10), 5>
<1, (1, 12), 4>
<1, (1, 12), 1>
<1, (2, 8), 13>
<1, (2, 8), 2>
<1, (2, 13), 11>
<1, (2, 13), 0>
<2, (8, 13), 11>
<2, (8, 13), 0>
<2, (1, 12), 4>
<2, (1, 12), 1>
<2, (2, 7), 0>
<2, (2, 7), 13>
<3, (0, 15), 4>
<3, (0, 15), 1>
<4, (18, 15), 0>
<4, (18, 15), 19>
<5, (10, 6), 11>
