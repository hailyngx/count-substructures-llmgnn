Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 9, 3, 5, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
<0, 4, 6, 1>  
<0, 4, 6, 2>  
<0, 4, 3, 7>  
<0, 4, 5, 6>  
<0, 5, 6, 1>  
<0, 8, 7, 3>  
<0, 9, 8, 7>  
<0, 9, 1, 7>  
<1, 7, 3, 0>  
<1, 7, 6, 4>  
<1, 9, 8, 0>  

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0, 4, 6, 1> has a chord (4, 1)  
<0, 4, 6, 2> has a chord (4, 6)  
<0, 4, 3, 7> has a chord (4, 7)  
<0, 4, 5, 6> has a chord (4, 6)  
<0, 5, 6, 1> has a chord (5, 1)  
<0, 8, 7, 3> has a chord (8, 3)  
<0, 9, 8, 7> has a chord (9, 7)  
<0, 9, 1, 7> has a chord (9, 7)  
<1, 7, 3, 0> has a chord (3, 1)  
<1, 7, 6, 4> has a chord (6, 4)  
<1, 9, 8, 0> has a chord (9, 8)  

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 11 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [11].
