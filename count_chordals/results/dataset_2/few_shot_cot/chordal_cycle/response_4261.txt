Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 13) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 4) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (13, 6) (13, 1) (13, 11) (13, 10) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 10) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 11) (12, 3) (12, 14) (12, 11) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 11) (10, 5) (10, 9) (10, 13) (10, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 0) (11, 14) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 8) (14, 12) (14, 11) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 7, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 13, and node 8

Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 0, and node 11
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 2, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 14, 10, 1, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 9, 13, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 13, 7, 12, 0, and node 14
Node 12 is connected to node 3, 14, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 1, 11, and node 10
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 12, and node 11

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 1, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 5, 14, 12, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 8, 1, 13, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 3, 12, 14, 11, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 10, 13, 6, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 8, 14, 12, 11, 7, 0, 4, 2>
- Cycle 7: <5, 14, 12, 3, 7, 11, 13, 6, 5>
- Cycle 8: <9, 5, 10, 2, 8, 1, 13, 11, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 9, 1, 8, 4, 0> has a chord (1, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 9, 5, 14, 12, 0> has a chord (5, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 9, 10, 13, 6, 7, 3, 1> has a chord (9, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, 8, 14, 12, 11, 7, 0, 4, 2> has a chord (8, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 4 chordal 4-cycles, therefore the number of chordless cycles is [4].
