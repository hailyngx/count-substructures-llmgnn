Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycles of length 4:
1. <0, 10, 8, 13, 1, 14>
2. <0, 10, 15, 1, 14>
3. <0, 10, 1, 13, 8>
4. <0, 10, 1, 15, 10>
5. <0, 12, 2, 6, 9>
6. <0, 12, 2, 19, 9>
7. <0, 12, 4, 12>
8. <0, 12, 16, 12>
9. <0, 17, 19, 9, 6>
10. <0, 17, 19, 13, 8>
11. <0, 17, 5, 11, 9>
12. <1, 13, 8, 10, 14>
13. <1, 13, 19, 9, 6>
14. <1, 14, 10, 15, 1>
15. <2, 6, 7, 2>
16. <2, 6, 9, 3, 2>
17. <2, 6, 9, 19, 2>
18. <2, 12, 0, 10, 1>
19. <2, 12, 4, 12>
20. <2, 12, 16, 12>
21. <2, 19, 13, 8, 10>
22. <2, 19, 17, 0, 12>
23. <3, 9, 6, 7, 2>
24. <5, 0, 12, 2, 6>
25. <5, 0, 17, 19, 9>
26. <5, 11, 9, 6, 7>
27. <9, 6, 7, 2, 3>
28. <9, 11, 18, 17, 19>
29. <13, 8, 10, 15, 1>
30. <17, 0, 12, 2, 6>
31. <17, 0, 10, 8, 13>
32. <17, 5, 11, 9, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, 10, 8, 13, 1> (Chord: (1, 13))
2. <0, 10, 1, 15, 10> (Chord: (1, 15))
3. <0, 12, 2, 6, 9> (Chord: (2, 6))
4. <0, 17, 19, 9, 6> (Chord: (9, 19))
5. <1, 13, 8, 10, 14> (Chord: (13, 10))
6. <2, 12, 0, 10, 1> (Chord: (0, 1))
7. <9, 6, 7, 2, 3> (Chord: (2, 3))
8. <13, 8, 10, 15, 1> (Chord: (1, 15))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]
