Response:
Based on the given graph, we can determine the unique chordal 4-cycle as follows:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <5, 9, 13, 8>
- <5, 9, 7, 4>
- <5, 9, 6, 3>
- <5, 3, 14, 4>
- <5, 3, 6, 9>
- <9, 6, 3, 5>
- <9, 6, 11, 1>
- <9, 2, 3, 6>
- <9, 2, 4, 8>
- <9, 13, 7, 4>
- <6, 9, 13, 7>
- <6, 11, 1, 4>
- <6, 11, 0, 12>
- <1, 11, 6, 9>
- <1, 11, 0, 12>
- <1, 4, 7, 9>
- <1, 4, 14, 3>
- <4, 1, 12, 0>
- <4, 1, 11, 6>
- <4, 8, 13, 7>
- <4, 8, 12, 0>
- <7, 9, 13, 8>
- <7, 13, 9, 6>
- <7, 13, 0, 12>
- <0, 6, 9, 13>
- <0, 6, 11, 1>
- <0, 7, 4, 1>
- <0, 7, 13, 9>
- <2, 9, 13, 7>
- <2, 3, 5, 8>
- <2, 3, 6, 11>
- <2, 4, 1, 12>
- <12, 0, 6, 9>
- <12, 0, 7, 4>
- <12, 1, 11, 6>
- <12, 1, 4, 7>
- <13, 9, 6, 3>
- <13, 9, 7, 4>
- <13, 8, 5, 3>
- <13, 8, 4, 7>
- <14, 3, 6, 9>
- <14, 3, 5, 8>
- <14, 4, 1, 11>
- <14, 4, 7, 13>
- <10, 1, 11, 6>
- <10, 2, 9, 13>
- <10, 14, 3, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 6, 3> has exactly one chord: (6, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [1].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <5, 9, 6, 3> with one chord (6, 9).
