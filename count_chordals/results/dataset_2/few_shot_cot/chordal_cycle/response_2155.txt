Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
The graph has the following unique chordal 4-cycle:

<0, 5, 3, 4> with chord (0, 3)

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
