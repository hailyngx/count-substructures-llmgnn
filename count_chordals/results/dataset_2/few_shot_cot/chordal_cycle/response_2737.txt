Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in this graph. We will list them first: 
<0, 4, 5, 7>, <0, 4, 6, 7>, <0, 4, 2, 1>, <1, 2, 6, 3>, <1, 4, 2, 6>, <2, 6, 7, 5>, <2, 6, 4, 5>, <3, 6, 7, 5>, <3, 6, 4, 5>, <4, 6, 7, 5>, <7, 6, 4, 5>, <0, 4, 2, 3, 8>, <1, 4, 2, 3, 8>

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed, the following cycles have exactly one chord:
<0, 4, 2, 1>, chord: (2, 4)
<1, 2, 6, 3>, chord: (2, 6)
<1, 4, 2, 6>, chord: (4, 2)
<7, 6, 4, 5>, chord: (6, 4)
<0, 4, 2, 3, 8>, chord: (4, 3)
<1, 4, 2, 3, 8>, chord: (4, 3)

Step 3:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
