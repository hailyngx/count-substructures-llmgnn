Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the given graph:
1. Cycle <0, 4, 1, 3, 0>
2. Cycle <1, 4, 8, 7, 1>
3. Cycle <2, 4, 7, 1, 2>
4. Cycle <3, 1, 7, 4, 3>
5. Cycle <4, 7, 8, 5, 4>
6. Cycle <5, 8, 9, 2, 5>
7. Cycle <6, 5, 9, 8, 6>
8. Cycle <7, 8, 5, 6, 7>
9. Cycle <8, 9, 2, 1, 8>
10. Cycle <9, 5, 6, 3, 9>

Step 2: 
After checking each cycle, we find that the cycle <0, 4, 1, 3, 0> has one chord, which is edge (4, 1).
So, the chordal 4-cycles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 1, 3, 0>

Step 3: 
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
