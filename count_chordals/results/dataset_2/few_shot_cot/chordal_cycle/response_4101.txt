        - <1, 10, 6, 9>
        - <1, 10, 11, 13>
        - <1, 4, 5, 12>
        - <1, 7, 3, 4>
        - <1, 7, 9, 6>
        - <1, 7, 9, 14>

        - <12, 2, 13, 14>
        - <13, 11, 6, 0>
        - <13, 11, 10, 1>
        - <13, 14, 9, 6>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - <1, 10, 6, 9> has a chord (1, 6)
        - <1, 10, 11, 13> has a chord (1, 11)
        - <0, 6, 10, 1> has a chord (0, 10)
        - <4, 10, 6, 9> has a chord (4, 6)
        - <6, 10, 1, 7> has a chord (6, 1)
        - <6, 10, 11, 13> has a chord (6, 11)
        - <10, 1, 7, 3> has a chord (10, 3)
        - <10, 1, 7, 9> has a chord (1, 7)
        - <10, 6, 11, 13> has a chord (10, 11)
        - <11, 6, 9, 7> has a chord (11, 9)
        - <11, 10, 4, 5> has a chord (11, 4)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 38 chordless cycles in total.

Putting the final count inside brackets: [38].
