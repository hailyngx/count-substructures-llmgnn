Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with every edge existing:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 7, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 2, 6, 5, 4, 2>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 3, 5, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 4, 8, 6, 9, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 4, 8, 5, 3, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 4, 7, 6, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 7, 8, 5, 3, 2>
- Cycle 9: <3, 5, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 7, 4, 8, 6, 9, 3>
- Cycle 11: <3, 7, 4, 8, 5, 1, 3>
- Cycle 12: <4, 7, 6, 9, 4>
- Cycle 13: <4, 7, 8, 6, 5, 3, 4>
- Cycle 14: <5, 6, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 15: <5, 6, 7, 3, 5>
- Cycle 16: <6, 7, 3, 5, 6>
- Cycle 17: <6, 7, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 18: <7, 3, 5, 6, 7>
- Cycle 19: <7, 4, 8, 6, 7>
- Cycle 20: <8, 6, 9, 8>
- Cycle 21: <8, 6, 7, 3, 8>
- Cycle 22: <8, 4, 7, 6, 8>
- Cycle 23: <9, 6, 7, 4, 9>

Step 2: Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 1, 7, 6, 0> has one chord: (1, 6)
- The cycle <0, 2, 6, 5, 4, 2> has one chord: (6, 4)
- The cycle <1, 7, 3, 5, 1> has one chord: (7, 3)
- The cycle <2, 4, 7, 8, 5, 3, 2> has one chord: (4, 8)
- The cycle <3, 7, 4, 8, 6, 9, 3> has one chord: (7, 6)
- The cycle <5, 6, 9, 8, 5> has one chord: (6, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [17].
