Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 5, 8, 10, 0>
- Cycle <0, 5, 12, 8, 0>
- Cycle <0, 10, 11, 7, 4, 9, 5, 0>
- Cycle <0, 10, 11, 7, 4, 6, 9, 5, 0>
- Cycle <0, 10, 3, 4, 9, 5, 0>
- Cycle <0, 10, 3, 4, 13, 9, 5, 0>
- Cycle <1, 12, 8, 5, 0, 14, 6, 10, 7, 11, 1>
- Cycle <2, 3, 0, 5, 8, 12, 1, 14, 6, 10, 7, 11, 2>
- Cycle <2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 1, 14, 6, 10, 0>
- Cycle <2, 14, 6, 10, 7, 11, 3, 0, 5, 8, 12, 1>
- Cycle <2, 14, 6, 9, 4, 7, 11, 3>
- Cycle <3, 4, 7, 11, 10, 6, 9>
- Cycle <4, 7, 11, 10, 6, 9, 5>
- Cycle <4, 9, 5, 8, 12>
- Cycle <6, 9, 5, 8, 12>

Step 2: Checking for Chords:
- Chord for cycle <0, 5, 8, 10, 0>: (5, 10)
- Chord for cycle <1, 12, 8, 5, 0, 14, 6, 10, 7, 11, 1>: (8, 14)
- Chord for cycle <3, 4, 7, 11, 10, 6, 9>: (4, 10)
- Chord for cycle <4, 7, 11, 10, 6, 9, 5>: (7, 5)
- Chord for cycle <4, 9, 5, 8, 12>: (9, 8)
- Chord for cycle <6, 9, 5, 8, 12>: (9, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 12 chordless 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final number is [12].
