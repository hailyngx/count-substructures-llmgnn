Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: Identify cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:
1. Cycle <1, 4, 2, 5, 1>
2. Cycle <1, 4, 8, 5, 1>
3. Cycle <1, 2, 7, 4, 1>
4. Cycle <2, 5, 8, 4, 2>
5. Cycle <3, 7, 4, 1, 3>
6. Cycle <3, 8, 5, 1, 3>
7. Cycle <4, 2, 7, 8, 4>
8. Cycle <5, 9, 6, 2, 5>
9. Cycle <5, 8, 7, 2, 5>
10. Cycle <6, 5, 8, 4, 6>
11. Cycle <7, 8, 5, 2, 7>
12. Cycle <8, 5, 0, 4, 8>
13. Cycle <8, 4, 7, 3, 8>
14. Cycle <9, 5, 2, 6, 9>

Step 2: Check for the existence of a single chord in each cycle:
1. Cycle <1, 4, 2, 5, 1> contains a chord (4, 5).
2. Cycle <1, 4, 8, 5, 1> contains a chord (4, 5).
3. Cycle <1, 2, 7, 4, 1> contains a chord (2, 7).
4. Cycle <2, 5, 8, 4, 2> contains a chord (5, 4).
5. Cycle <3, 7, 4, 1, 3> contains a chord (4, 1).
6. Cycle <3, 8, 5, 1, 3> contains a chord (8, 5).
7. Cycle <4, 2, 7, 8, 4> contains a chord (2, 8).
8. Cycle <5, 9, 6, 2, 5> contains a chord (9, 6).
9. Cycle <5, 8, 7, 2, 5> contains a chord (8, 7).
10. Cycle <6, 5, 8, 4, 6> contains a chord (5, 4).
11. Cycle <7, 8, 5, 2, 7> contains a chord (8, 5).
12. Cycle <8, 5, 0, 4, 8> contains a chord (5, 4).
13. Cycle <8, 4, 7, 3, 8> contains a chord (4, 7).
14. Cycle <9, 5, 2, 6, 9> contains a chord (5, 2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0] as all identified cycles have at least one chord present.

Therefore, there are no chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
