Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all edges present:
1. <4, 7, 5, 13, 4>
2. <10, 4, 7, 9, 10>
3. <10, 4, 13, 9, 10>
4. <10, 4, 11, 5, 10>
5. <10, 4, 11, 6, 10>
6. <10, 11, 6, 3, 10>
7. <10, 11, 5, 8, 10>
8. <5, 7, 14, 10, 5>
9. <5, 13, 9, 1, 5>
10. <5, 13, 9, 7, 5>
11. <5, 13, 4, 7, 5>
12. <5, 8, 0, 2, 5>
13. <5, 8, 13, 9, 5>
14. <5, 8, 13, 4, 5>
15. <5, 12, 6, 11, 5>
16. <3, 2, 6, 12, 3>
17. <3, 6, 11, 5, 3>
18. <3, 6, 12, 5, 3>
19. <0, 10, 1, 13, 0>
20. <0, 10, 1, 9, 0>
21. <0, 10, 4, 13, 0>
22. <0, 8, 5, 13, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, 8, (13), 9, 5> with chord (13)
- <5, 13, (9), 1, 5> with chord (9)
- <3, 6, (11), 5, 3> with chord (11)
- <3, 6, (12), 5, 3> with chord (12)

Step 3: Count the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [4] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
