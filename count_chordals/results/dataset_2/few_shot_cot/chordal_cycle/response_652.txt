Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 5, 2, 9, 3>
2. <0, 5, 1, 7, 3>
3. <0, 5, 1, 8, 3>
4. <0, 6, 7, 9, 3>
5. <0, 6, 2, 5, 1>
6. <0, 6, 2, 9, 3>
7. <0, 8, 1, 7, 6>
8. <0, 8, 3, 9, 2>
9. <2, 5, 8, 4, 6>
10. <2, 5, 1, 7, 6>
11. <2, 5, 1, 3, 9>
12. <2, 9, 7, 6, 4>
13. <4, 6, 7, 9, 3>
14. <4, 6, 0, 5, 1>
15. <4, 6, 0, 8, 5>
16. <4, 8, 1, 7, 3>
17. <4, 8, 3, 9, 2>
18. <6, 7, 9, 3, 4>
19. <6, 7, 3, 1, 8>
20. <6, 7, 3, 9, 2>
21. <7, 1, 5, 2, 9>
22. <7, 1, 8, 4, 6>
23. <7, 3, 9, 2, 5>
24. <7, 3, 4, 6, 0>
25. <7, 3, 8, 1, 5>
26. <8, 5, 2, 9, 3>
27. <8, 5, 1, 7, 3>
28. <8, 5, 1, 3, 9>
29. <8, 0, 6, 7, 1>
30. <8, 0, 4, 6, 7>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 5, 1, 7, 6> has chord (6, 4) 
2. <0, 5, 1, 8, 3> has chord (1, 3)
3. <0, 6, 2, 9, 3> has chord (2, 9)
4. <6, 7, 9, 3, 4> has chord (9, 3)
5. <7, 1, 8, 4, 6> has chord (1, 8)

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
