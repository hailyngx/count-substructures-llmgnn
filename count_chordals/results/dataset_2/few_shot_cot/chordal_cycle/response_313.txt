Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

1. <0, 5, 2, 4, 0>
2. <0, 5, 8, 4, 0>
3. <1, 7, 4, 8, 1>
4. <2, 5, 8, 4, 2>
5. <3, 9, 2, 4, 3>
6. <3, 9, 4, 7, 1, 3>
7. <3, 4, 8, 7, 1, 3>
8. <3, 1, 7, 4, 3>
9. <4, 7, 8, 5, 0, 4>
10. <4, 7, 1, 3, 0, 4>
11. <8, 5, 2, 4, 8>
12. <8, 5, 0, 1, 7, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The chordless cycles are:
1. <0, 5, 2, 4, 0>
2. <0, 5, 8, 4, 0>
3. <3, 1, 7, 4, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [3].
