Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 4, 7, 5>
2. Cycle <0, 6, 3, 4>
3. Cycle <1, 5, 7, 2>
4. Cycle <2, 3, 6, 9>
5. Cycle <4, 2, 7, 8>
6. Cycle <5, 7, 4, 0>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord) are:
1. Cycle <0, 4, 7, 5> with chord (0, 7)
2. Cycle <0, 6, 3, 4> with chord (6, 3)
3. Cycle <1, 5, 7, 2> with chord (1, 7)
4. Cycle <5, 7, 4, 0> with chord (5, 4)

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
