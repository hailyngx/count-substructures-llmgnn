Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 27, 21, 5, 2> (Chord: (0, 2))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 28, 15, 9, 16, 26, 4> (Chord: (9, 26))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 14, 24, 25, 12, 7, 22> (Chord: (14, 25))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 14, 15, 28, 3, 2> (Chord: (14, 28))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 7, 5, 21, 8, 11> (Chord: (5, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, 16, 26, 25, 24, 14, 1> (Chord: (16, 24))
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <0, 28, 20, 21, 5, 2> (Chord: (2, 21))
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <0, 9, 23, 10, 22, 13> (Chord: (9, 10))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 31 chordless 4-cycles found.

Putting the final number inside brackets, the total number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [31].
