Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles of length 4: 
  - <0, 4, 6, 12>
  - <0, 3, 1, 9>
  - <0, 3, 2, 9>
  - <0, 9, 13, 5>
  - <0, 9, 13, 14>
  - <0, 9, 2, 3>
  - <1, 6, 4, 12>
  - <1, 6, 14, 11>
  - <1, 9, 13, 5>
  - <1, 9, 13, 14>
  - <1, 9, 2, 3>
  - <2, 9, 13, 5>
  - <2, 9, 13, 14>
  - <2, 9, 1, 3>
  - <3, 0, 9, 13>
  - <3, 2, 9, 13>
  - <4, 12, 6, 14>
  - <4, 12, 0, 3>
  - <4, 12, 0, 9>
  - <5, 13, 9, 1>
  - <5, 13, 9, 2>
  - <5, 13, 9, 0>
  - <5, 14, 11, 2>
  - <5, 14, 11, 4>
  - <5, 14, 11, 1>
  - <5, 14, 6, 4>
  - <5, 10, 7, 0>
  - <6, 14, 13, 9>
  - <6, 14, 13, 5>
  - <7, 0, 9, 13>
  - <8, 11, 14, 13>
  - <8, 11, 14, 5>
  - <10, 14, 11, 2>
  
Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycles:
  - <0, 9, 13, 5> (Chord: (9, 13))
  - <0, 9, 13, 14> (Chord: (9, 13))
  - <1, 6, 14, 11> (Chord: (6, 11))
  - <5, 13, 9, 1> (Chord: (13, 9))
  - <5, 13, 9, 2> (Chord: (13, 9))
  - <5, 13, 9, 0> (Chord: (13, 9))

Step 3:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [6]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
<0, 9, 13, 5>
<0, 9, 13, 14>
<1, 6, 14, 11>
<5, 13, 9, 1>
<5, 13, 9, 2>
<5, 13, 9, 0>
