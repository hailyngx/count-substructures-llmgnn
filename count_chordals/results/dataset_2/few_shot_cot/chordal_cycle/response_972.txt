- Cycle 30: <19, 4, 14, 5> with edges (19, 4), (4, 14), (14, 5), (5, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 8, 13, 2> has a chord (8, 2)
- <0, 8, 13, 3> has a chord (8, 3)
- <0, 7, 6, 16> has a chord (7, 16)
- <0, 7, 16, 5> has a chord (7, 5)
- <2, 13, 19, 17> has a chord (13, 17)
- <2, 12, 15, 18> has a chord (12, 15)
- <3, 13, 8, 0> has a chord (13, 0)
- <4, 2, 19, 15> has a chord (2, 15)
- <6, 7, 0, 8> has a chord (7, 0)
- <7, 16, 1, 18> has a chord (16, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are 21 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [21].
