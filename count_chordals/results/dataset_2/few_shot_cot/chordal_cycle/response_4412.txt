Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
        - <0, 6, 9, 4, 8>
        - <0, 6, 9, 11, 1>
        - <0, 6, 12, 5, 14>
        - <0, 3, 10, 5, 12>
        - <1, 7, 8, 11, 6>
        - <1, 7, 14, 5, 12>
        - <2, 8, 11, 6, 9>
        - <3, 0, 6, 9, 4>
        - <4, 9, 11, 1, 7>
        - <5, 12, 6, 9, 4>
        - <5, 12, 13, 7, 14>
        - <8, 4, 9, 6, 0>
        - <10, 9, 6, 12, 5>
        - <13, 7, 1, 11, 8>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <0, 6, 9, 4, 8> has one chord: (6, 4)
        - <0, 6, 9, 11, 1> has one chord: (9, 1)
        - <0, 6, 12, 5, 14> has one chord: (6, 14)
        - <0, 3, 10, 5, 12> has one chord: (3, 5)
        - <1, 7, 8, 11, 6> has one chord: (7, 11)
        - <1, 7, 14, 5, 12> has one chord: (7, 5)
        - <2, 8, 11, 6, 9> has one chord: (8, 6)
        - <3, 0, 6, 9, 4> has one chord: (0, 9)
        - <4, 9, 11, 1, 7> has one chord: (9, 1)
        - <5, 12, 6, 9, 4> has one chord: (12, 9)
        - <5, 12, 13, 7, 14> has one chord: (12, 7)
        - <8, 4, 9, 6, 0> has one chord: (4, 6)
        - <10, 9, 6, 12, 5> has one chord: (9, 12)
        - <13, 7, 1, 11, 8> has one chord: (7, 11)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles found, which is 0. Therefore, the final count is [0].
