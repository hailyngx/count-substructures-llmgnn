Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <5, 3, 1, 7, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 7, 1, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 8, 3, 1, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 4, 2, 0, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 7, 9, 0, 6, 4, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <5, 3, 1, 7, 5> has a chord 1-7
- <5, 9, 7, 1, 5> has a chord 1-7
- <5, 8, 3, 1, 5> doesn't have a chord
- <5, 4, 2, 0, 6, 1, 5> doesn't have a chord
- <5, 7, 9, 0, 6, 4, 5> doesn't have a chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are: <5, 3, 1, 7, 5> and <5, 9, 7, 1, 5>.
