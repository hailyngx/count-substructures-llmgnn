Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists are:
- <0, 4, 7, 9>
- <0, 4, 6, 9>
- <0, 4, 3, 9>
- <0, 1, 5, 2>
- <0, 1, 8, 5>
- <1, 8, 9, 6>
- <2, 3, 8, 5>
- <2, 4, 7, 9>
- <3, 4, 7, 9>
- <3, 4, 6, 9>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 7, 9> has chord (4, 9)
- <0, 4, 6, 9> has chord (4, 9)
- <0, 4, 3, 9> has chord (4, 9)
- <0, 1, 5, 2> has chord (1, 5)
- <0, 1, 8, 5> has chord (1, 5)
- <1, 8, 9, 6> has chord (8, 6)
- <2, 3, 8, 5> has chord (3, 8)
- <2, 4, 7, 9> has chord (4, 7)
- <3, 4, 7, 9> has chord (4, 7)
- <3, 4, 6, 9> has chord (4, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
