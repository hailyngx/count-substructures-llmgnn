Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (3, 1, 7, 5, 3) with edges (3, 1), (1, 7), (7, 5), and (5, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 1, 2, 4, 3) with edges (3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and (4, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 2, 4, 8, 3) with edges (3, 2), (2, 4), (4, 8), and (8, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 2, 9, 8, 3) with edges (3, 2), (2, 9), (9, 8), and (8, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 7, 1, 2, 3) with edges (3, 7), (7, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3)

Step 2: Check for each cycle if it has exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: None.
