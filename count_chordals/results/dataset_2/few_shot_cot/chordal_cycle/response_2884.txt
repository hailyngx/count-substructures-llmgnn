Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph. We will list them ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-3-1-4
- Cycle 2: 4-7-5-1-4
- Cycle 3: 4-1-6-5-4
- Cycle 4: 7-8-6-3-7

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-3-1-4 has the chord (7, 1)
- Cycle 2: 4-7-5-1-4 has the chord (7, 1)
- Cycle 3: 4-1-6-5-4 has the chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 4: 7-8-6-3-7 has the chord (8, 3)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
There is 1 chordless cycle: <4, 1, 6, 5>

Therefore, the answer is [1].
