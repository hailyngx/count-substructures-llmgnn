Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 3, 4, 9>
2. <0, 3, 6, 8>
3. <0, 4, 9, 8>
4. <0, 6, 8, 9>
5. <1, 4, 9, 5>
6. <1, 5, 7, 9>
7. <1, 8, 6, 4>
8. <2, 7, 5, 9>
9. <2, 7, 0, 3>
10. <2, 8, 1, 5>
11. <2, 8, 6, 4>
12. <3, 0, 6, 4>
13. <4, 0, 8, 6>
14. <5, 1, 4, 9>
15. <5, 7, 9, 2>
16. <6, 3, 0, 4>
17. <6, 4, 9, 8>
18. <7, 5, 9, 2>
19. <7, 0, 3, 6>
20. <8, 1, 5, 7>
21. <8, 2, 7, 5>
22. <8, 2, 9, 4>
23. <8, 6, 3, 0>
24. <9, 5, 7, 0>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <1, 5, 4, 9> with chord (1, 9).

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [23].
