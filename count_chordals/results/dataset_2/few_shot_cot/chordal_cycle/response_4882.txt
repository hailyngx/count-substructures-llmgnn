Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 2, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycles of length 4:
1. <0, 4, 5, 1, 0>
2. <0, 4, 5, 8, 0>
3. <1, 3, 8, 5, 1>
4. <2, 4, 5, 8, 2>
5. <3, 1, 6, 3, 1>
6. <3, 0, 4, 5, 3>
7. <5, 1, 8, 2, 5>
8. <5, 4, 0, 3, 5>
9. <7, 0, 4, 5, 7>
10. <7, 9, 8, 5, 7>
11. <8, 5, 1, 3, 8>
12. <8, 5, 4, 0, 8>
13. <9, 7, 0, 3, 9>
14. <9, 8, 5, 4, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Only cycle 8 <5, 1, 8, 2, 5> has exactly one chord (edge 1-2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 13 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1]. 
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, 1, 8, 2, 5>.
