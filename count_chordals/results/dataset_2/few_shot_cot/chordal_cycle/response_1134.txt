Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the given graph. We will list them and check for chords.

Cycles:
1. <5, 9, 3, 1>
2. <5, 9, 11, 3>
3. <5, 9, 11, 6>
4. <5, 9, 10, 5>
5. <5, 1, 6, 11>
6. <5, 1, 4, 11>
7. <9, 3, 11, 6>
8. <9, 3, 7, 11>
9. <9, 11, 7, 3>
10. <9, 11, 4, 1>
11. <1, 6, 11, 4>
12. <3, 7, 11, 9>
13. <6, 11, 4, 12>
14. <11, 7, 2, 10>
15. <11, 4, 12, 6>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <5, 9, 3, 1, (5, 3)>
2. <5, 1, 4, 11, (1, 11)>
3. <9, 3, 11, 6, (3, 6)>
4. <3, 7, 11, 9, (7, 9)>
5. <6, 11, 4, 12, (11, 12)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we get a total of [5].
