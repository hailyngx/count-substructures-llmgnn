Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 26, 1, 25, 0>
- <0, 26, 11, 3, 21, 12, 0>
- <0, 26, 11, 13, 11, 3, 21, 27, 25, 0>
- <0, 26, 11, 16, 24, 22, 4, 25, 0>
- <1, 26, 11, 3, 21, 12, 18, 7, 17, 29, 5, 24, 6, 19, 1>
- <2, 29, 5, 24, 16, 11, 13, 11, 3, 2>
- <2, 29, 5, 24, 16, 11, 26, 1, 25, 4, 2>
- <2, 29, 17, 7, 18, 21, 3, 11, 13, 11, 26, 1, 25, 22, 24, 5>
- <4, 25, 1, 26, 11, 16, 24, 5, 29, 2>
- <5, 24, 16, 11, 3, 21, 12, 0, 26, 1, 25>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 26, 1, 25, 0> - No chord
- <0, 26, 11, 3, 21, 12, 0> - Chord: (11, 3)
- <0, 26, 11, 13, 11, 3, 21, 27, 25, 0> - No chord
- <0, 26, 11, 16, 24, 22, 4, 25, 0> - Chord: (16, 24)
- <1, 26, 11, 3, 21, 12, 18, 7, 17, 29, 5, 24, 6, 19, 1> - No chord
- <2, 29, 5, 24, 16, 11, 13, 11, 3, 2> - No chord
- <2, 29, 5, 24, 16, 11, 26, 1, 25, 4, 2> - No chord
- <2, 29, 17, 7, 18, 21, 3, 11, 13, 11, 26, 1, 25, 22, 24, 5> - No chord
- <4, 25, 1, 26, 11, 16, 24, 5, 29, 2> - No chord
- <5, 24, 16, 11, 3, 21, 12, 0, 26, 1, 25> - No chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [5]
