Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 1, 4, 6> with chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 1, 8, 9> with chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 7, 9, 4> with chord (7, 4)
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, 3, 8, 9> with chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 6, 5, 2> with chord (4, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycle 1: <0, 3, 1, 4, 6> with chord (1, 6)
- Chordal cycle 2: <0, 5, 7, 9, 4> with chord (7, 4)
- Chordal cycle 3: <1, 2, 3, 8, 9> with chord (3, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [0] chordless cycles found.
