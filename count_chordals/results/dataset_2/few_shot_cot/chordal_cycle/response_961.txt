Response:
To find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, we will follow the steps outlined earlier.

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
   - We can identify the following cycles in the graph:
     <5, 9, 2, 7, 4> (C5), <1, 6, 13, 2, 9> (C4), <1, 6, 13, 7, 4> (C5), <1, 11, 7, 4, 3> (C5), <1, 11, 7, 13, 6> (C5), <1, 11, 0, 3, 4> (C5), <1, 14, 13, 7, 4> (C5), <1, 14, 13, 6, 2> (C5), <2, 9, 3, 4, 7> (C5), <2, 9, 3, 0, 11> (C5), <2, 9, 5, 10, 8> (C4), <2, 7, 4, 3, 0> (C5), <2, 7, 4, 13, 6> (C5), <2, 7, 12, 13, 6> (C5), <2, 13, 7, 4, 3> (C5), <2, 13, 7, 12, 5> (C5), <2, 13, 14, 1, 11> (C5), <3, 9, 2, 7, 4> (C5), <3, 9, 2, 13, 7> (C5), <3, 4, 7, 11, 5> (C5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
   - From the listed cycles, the following cycle has exactly one chord (C4):
     <2, 9, 5, 10, 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
   - The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <2, 4, 8, 10>.
