Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 14, 5, 15, 2> - Chord: (5, 15)
- <0, 14, 5, 15, 16> - Chord: (5, 15)
- <0, 13, 1, 11, 17> - Chord: (1, 17)
- <1, 13, 0, 14, 5> - Chord: (0, 14)
- <1, 13, 11, 17, 10> - Chord: (11, 17)
- <2, 6, 4, 10, 9> - Chord: (4, 10)
- <4, 10, 17, 11, 13> - Chord: (11, 17)
- <4, 10, 9, 3, 1> - Chord: (9, 3)
- <5, 14, 0, 13, 11> - Chord: (13, 0)
- <7, 16, 8, 12, 4> - Chord: (8, 16)
- <8, 16, 15, 19, 17> - Chord: (15, 16)
- <12, 8, 16, 15, 2> - Chord: (8, 16)
- <15, 19, 17, 11, 13> - Chord: (17, 19)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [22]
