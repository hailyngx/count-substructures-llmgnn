Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: <0, 13, 11, 1, 3, 6, 9, 0>
        - Cycle 2: <0, 13, 11, 1, 10, 14, 3, 6, 9, 0>
        - Cycle 3: <0, 13, 11, 1, 7, 4, 12, 9, 0>
        - Cycle 4: <4, 7, 1, 11, 13, 0, 9, 6, 3, 14, 10, 4>
        - Cycle 5: <2, 8, 13, 11, 1, 7, 4, 12, 9, 6, 3, 14, 10, 5, 0, 2>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - Out of the listed cycles, only Cycle 4: <4, 7, 1, 11, 13, 0, 9, 6, 3, 14, 10, 4> has exactly one chord (7, 13).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There is 1 chordless 4-cycle found. 

Therefore, the final count is [1].
