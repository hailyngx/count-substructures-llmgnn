Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 14, 6, 2, 12, 4, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 14, 6, 2, 12, 3, 14, 5, 1, 7, 8, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 14, 6, 8, 7, 9, 12, 1, 5, 10, 3, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 14, 6, 8, 7, 9, 12, 1, 7, 11, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 14, 6, 8, 7, 11, 0, 13, 4, 12, 2, 14, 5, 1, 9, 12, 3, 10, 5, 7)
- Cycle 6: (1, 5, 7, 8, 11, 7, 9, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 5, 10, 3, 12, 4, 13, 0, 14, 6, 8, 7, 9, 12, 2, 14, 5)
- Cycle 8: (1, 7, 11, 0, 14, 6, 2, 12, 4, 0)
- Cycle 9: (1, 7, 11, 8, 6, 14, 5, 10, 3, 12, 2, 14, 0)
- Cycle 10: (2, 6, 8, 7, 5, 10, 3, 12, 4, 13, 0, 14, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, (14, 6), 2>
- Cycle 2: <0, (14, 5), 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, (14, 6), 8>
- Cycle 4: <0, (14, 6), 8>
- Cycle 5: <0, (14, 5), 1>
- Cycle 6: No chord
- Cycle 7: <1, (5, 7), 9>
- Cycle 8: <1, (5, 7), 9>
- Cycle 9: <1, (7, 8), 0>
- Cycle 10: <2, (6, 8), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 2 chordless cycles found, therefore the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [8].
       
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- Cycle 1: <0, (14, 6), 2>
- Cycle 2: <0, (14, 5), 1>
