Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. <1, 5, 13, 6>
2. <1, 5, 13, 9>
3. <1, 5, 17, 18>
4. <1, 19, 8, 9>
5. <1, 19, 8, 14>
6. <1, 19, 12, 11>
7. <1, 15, 7, 17>
8. <2, 18, 4, 13>
9. <2, 18, 4, 16>
10. <2, 10, 12, 11>
11. <3, 4, 13, 6>
12. <3, 4, 16, 13>
13. <4, 18, 17, 5>
14. <4, 13, 6, 9>
15. <4, 13, 16, 14>
16. <5, 13, 6, 9>
17. <5, 13, 16, 4>
18. <7, 3, 4, 13>
19. <7, 17, 18, 4>
20. <7, 17, 5, 13>
21. <11, 0, 17, 5>
22. <11, 0, 17, 7>
23. <11, 12, 10, 2>
24. <11, 12, 19, 1>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, 5, 17, 18> (Chord: (5, 17))
2. <1, 15, 7, 17> (Chord: (15, 7))
3. <2, 18, 4, 13> (Chord: (2, 4))
4. <4, 13, 6, 9> (Chord: (13, 6))
5. <4, 13, 16, 14> (Chord: (13, 16))
6. <11, 0, 17, 5> (Chord: (0, 17))
7. <11, 12, 10, 2> (Chord: (12, 10))

Step 3:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
