Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 13, 11, 5> is a cycle of length 4
- <0, 13, 17, 10> is a cycle of length 4
- <0, 13, 17, 16> is a cycle of length 4
- <0, 13, 11, 19, 17> is a cycle of length 5
- <0, 13, 11, 9, 17> is a cycle of length 5
- <0, 13, 17, 19, 11> is a cycle of length 5
- <0, 16, 17, 13> is a cycle of length 4
- <0, 16, 17, 10> is a cycle of length 4
- <0, 16, 3, 4> is a cycle of length 4
- <1, 10, 17, 13> is a cycle of length 4
- <1, 10, 17, 16> is a cycle of length 4
- <1, 10, 6, 2> is a cycle of length 4
- <2, 7, 18, 14> is a cycle of length 4
- <2, 7, 18, 8> is a cycle of length 4
- <2, 7, 18, 0> is a cycle of length 4
- <2, 7, 18, 14, 15> is a cycle of length 5
- <2, 6, 10, 17> is a cycle of length 4
- <2, 6, 10, 1> is a cycle of length 4
- <2, 6, 10, 17, 13> is a cycle of length 5
- <3, 4, 8, 18> is a cycle of length 4
- <3, 4, 8, 18, 7> is a cycle of length 5
- <3, 4, 15, 14> is a cycle of length 4
- <3, 4, 15, 14, 2> is a cycle of length 5
- <3, 16, 17, 13> is a cycle of length 4
- <3, 16, 17, 10> is a cycle of length 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
The only chordal 4-cycle found is <3, 4, 15, 14> with the chord (3, 15).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

The final count is [1].
