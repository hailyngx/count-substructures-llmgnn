Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
        - <0, 3, 5, 1> Cycle
        - <1, 5, 9, 2> Cycle
        - <3, 5, 6, 1> Cycle
        - <4, 7, 8, 2> Cycle
        - <4, 1, 5, 9> Cycle
        - <5, 6, 3, 7> Cycle
        - <7, 3, 0, 9> Cycle

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <0, 3, 5, 1> has a chord: (3, 1)
        - <1, 5, 9, 2> has a chord: (5, 9)
        - <3, 5, 6, 1> has a chord: (5, 6)
        - <4, 7, 8, 2> has a chord: (7, 8)
        - <4, 1, 5, 9> has a chord: (1, 5)
        - <5, 6, 3, 7> has a chord: (6, 7)
        - <7, 3, 0, 9> has a chord: (3, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
        There are [7] chordal 4-cycles found.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
        - <0, 3, 5, 1> with chord (3, 1)
        - <1, 5, 9, 2> with chord (5, 9)
        - <3, 5, 6, 1> with chord (5, 6)
        - <4, 7, 8, 2> with chord (7, 8)
        - <4, 1, 5, 9> with chord (1, 5)
        - <5, 6, 3, 7> with chord (6, 7)
        - <7, 3, 0, 9> with chord (3, 9)
