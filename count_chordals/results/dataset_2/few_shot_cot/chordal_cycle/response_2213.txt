        - Cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 6, 5>
        - Cycle 2: <0, 2, 3, 10, 14>
        - Cycle 3: <0, 2, 3, 9, 7>
        - Cycle 4: <0, 2, 11, 7, 4>
        - Cycle 5: <0, 2, 11, 1, 14>
        - Cycle 6: <0, 4, 7, 9, 3>
        - Cycle 7: <0, 4, 13, 1, 11>
        - Cycle 8: <0, 4, 13, 12, 2>

        - Cycle 15: <2, 0, 4, 7, 6>
        - Cycle 16: <2, 0, 4, 13, 1>
        - Cycle 17: <2, 0, 14, 1, 13>
        - Cycle 18: <2, 3, 10, 14, 8>
        - Cycle 19: <2, 3, 9, 7, 4>
        - Cycle 20: <2, 11, 7, 4, 13>
        - Cycle 21: <2, 11, 6, 7, 4>

        - Cycle 24: <4, 0, 2, 12, 13>
        - Cycle 25: <4, 7, 6, 5, 11>
        - Cycle 26: <4, 13, 1, 14, 10>
        - Cycle 27: <6, 5, 11, 7, 4>
        - Cycle 28: <6, 7, 4, 13, 12>
        - Cycle 29: <10, 3, 9, 7, 4>
        - Cycle 30: <10, 8, 12, 13, 4>
        - Cycle 31: <10, 13, 4, 0, 2>
        - Cycle 32: <10, 14, 1, 13, 4>
        - Cycle 33: <11, 1, 13, 4, 0>
        - Cycle 34: <11, 2, 0, 4, 13>
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 6, 5> (Chord: (4, 7))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 2, 11, 1, 14> (Chord: (1, 11))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 4, 13, 12, 2> (Chord: (13, 12))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 13, 12, 2, 11> (Chord: (13, 2))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, 0, 2, 12, 13> (Chord: (0, 2))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, 13, 1, 14, 10> (Chord: (1, 14))
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 28 chordless cycles found.
        
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
