Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 0, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, 5, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 5, 7, 1) 
- Cycle 2: (1, 9, 7, 2, 4, 1) 
- Cycle 3: (2, 4, 9, 7, 2) 
- Cycle 4: (4, 8, 0, 6, 4) 
- Cycle 5: (5, 3, 1, 7, 5) 
- Cycle 6: (5, 4, 8, 0, 5) 
- Cycle 7: (5, 6, 0, 4, 5) 
- Cycle 8: (5, 7, 1, 9, 5) 
- Cycle 9: (6, 4, 8, 0, 6) 
- Cycle 10: (7, 1, 3, 5, 7) 
- Cycle 11: (7, 2, 4, 9, 7) 
- Cycle 12: (8, 4, 9, 7, 8) 
- Cycle 13: (9, 1, 3, 5, 9) 
- Cycle 14: (9, 2, 7, 1, 9) 

Step 2: 
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (3, 7), 5)> 
- <1, (2, 9), 7, 4)> 
- <2, (4, 7), 9)> 
- <4, (8, 0), 6)> 
- <5, (3, 7), 1)> 
- <5, (4, 0), 8)> 
- <5, (6, 0), 4)> 
- <5, (1, 9), 7)> 
- <6, (4, 0), 5)> 
- <7, (1, 3), 5)> 
- <7, (4, 9), 2)> 
- <8, (4, 7), 9)> 
- <9, (1, 3), 5)> 
- <9, (2, 7), 1)> 

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There are a total of [14] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
