Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
In this graph, there are multiple chordal 4-cycles. Let's go step by step to identify and count them:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 6, 4, 5> with edges (0, 1), (1, 6), (6, 4), (4, 5), (5, 0)
- Cycle 2: <3, 7, 4, 6, 2> with edges (3, 7), (7, 4), (4, 6), (6, 2), (2, 3)
- Cycle 3: <5, 4, 6, 2, 8> with edges (5, 4), (4, 6), (6, 2), (2, 8), (8, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (4, 2).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (6, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles: <3, 7, 4, 6, 2> and <5, 4, 6, 2, 8>. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [1].
