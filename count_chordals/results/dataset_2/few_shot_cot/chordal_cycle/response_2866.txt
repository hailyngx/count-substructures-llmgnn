Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are multiple cycles of length 4 present in the graph. However, for chordal cycles, we need to check for the presence of a chord in each cycle.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycles found in the graph are:
1. <1, (5, 4), 7, 3>
2. <3, (8, 6), 6, 1>
3. <3, (8, 4), 4, 7>
4. <4, (2, 9), 9, 5>
5. <4, (7, 2), 2, 6>
6. <5, (1, 9), 9, 4>
7. <6, (1, 8), 8, 3>
8. <6, (2, 7), 7, 1>
9. <8, (3, 9), 9, 4>
10. <8, (3, 4), 4, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [10].
