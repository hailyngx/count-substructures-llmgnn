Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 8, 9, 3>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 5, 1, 7>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 5, 7, 9>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 8, 9, 4>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 4, 9, 8>
- Cycle 7: <1, 7, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 8: <1, 7, 9, 3, 2>
- Cycle 9: <1, 7, 9, 8, 6>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 6, 8, 9, 3> (Chord: (8, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 6, 5, 1, 7> (Chord: (5, 1))

Step 3:
Total number of chordal 4-cycles (inside brackets): [2] 

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 6, 8, 9, 3> (Chord: (8, 9))
- <0, 6, 5, 1, 7> (Chord: (5, 1))
