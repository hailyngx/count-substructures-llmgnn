Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 4, 5, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 4, 3, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 9, 2, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 4, 7, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 6, 4, 7, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 4, 7, 9, 3>
- Cycle 8: <3, 7, 8, 1, 3>
- Cycle 9: <6, 4, 7, 9, 6>
- Cycle 10: <7, 8, 1, 5, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (4, 1)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (4, 3)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (9, 2)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (4, 1)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (4, 2)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (7, 9)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (1, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0]. 

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 7, 4, 5, 1> with a chord (4, 1), and the count of chordless cycles is [0].
