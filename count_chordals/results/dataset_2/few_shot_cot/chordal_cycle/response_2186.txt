Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more that exist in the graph are:
1. <0, 4, 7, 9>
2. <2, 6, 3, 9>
3. <1, 4, 7, 9>
4. <3, 6, 2, 8>
5. <0, 9, 1, 4>
6. <0, 9, 7, 1>
7. <0, 5, 7, 9>
8. <2, 6, 3, 1>
9. <2, 8, 7, 1>
10. <4, 7, 1, 8>
11. <7, 9, 3, 1>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:
1. <0, 4, 7, 9>, chord: (0, 7)
2. <2, 6, 3, 9>, chord: (2, 3)
3. <1, 4, 7, 9>, chord: (1, 7)
4. <3, 6, 2, 8>, chord: (6, 8)
5. <0, 9, 1, 4>, chord: (9, 1)
6. <0, 9, 7, 1>, chord: (0, 1)
7. <0, 5, 7, 9>, chord: (5, 7)
8. <2, 6, 3, 1>, chord: (2, 1)
9. <2, 8, 7, 1>, chord: (8, 1)
10. <4, 7, 1, 8>, chord: (4, 1)
11. <7, 9, 3, 1>, chord: (9, 3)

Step 3:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. Therefore, the count of chordless cycles is [0].
