Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <4, 7, 1, 3, 4>
- Cycle 2: <4, 10, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 3: <4, 10, 12, 7, 4>
- Cycle 4: <7, 12, 13, 0, 2, 7>
- Cycle 5: <7, 14, 2, 0, 13, 5, 7>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 9, 13, 0, 2, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 6, 1>
- Cycle 8: <3, 9, 13, 12, 10, 6, 11, 5, 3>
- Cycle 9: <10, 6, 11, 5, 13, 12, 7, 4, 8, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Checking Cycle 1: <4, 7, 1, 3, 4> has a chord (7, 3)
- Checking Cycle 2: <4, 10, 6, 1, 4> has a chord (10, 1)
- Checking Cycle 3: <4, 10, 12, 7, 4> has a chord (10, 7)
- Checking Cycle 4: <7, 12, 13, 0, 2, 7> has a chord (12, 0)
- Checking Cycle 5: <7, 14, 2, 0, 13, 5, 7> has a chord (14, 0)
- Checking Cycle 6: <1, 3, 9, 13, 0, 2, 1> has a chord (3, 13)
- Checking Cycle 7: <1, 3, 5, 7, 4, 6, 1> has a chord (3, 7)
- Checking Cycle 8: <3, 9, 13, 12, 10, 6, 11, 5, 3> has a chord (9, 10)
- Checking Cycle 9: <10, 6, 11, 5, 13, 12, 7, 4, 8, 10> has a chord (6, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final result is [0].
