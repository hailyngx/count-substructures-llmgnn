Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 9, 7, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 4, 1, 7, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 7, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 4, 3, 1, 2)
- Cycle 5: (4, 7, 1, 3, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 7, 5, 1, 4)
- Cycle 7: (6, 7, 4, 3, 6)
- Cycle 8: (7, 4, 3, 8, 7)
- Cycle 9: (7, 5, 1, 0, 7)
- Cycle 10: (7, 5, 1, 2, 7)
- Cycle 11: (9, 4, 3, 8, 9)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (1, 7).
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord (4, 1).
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord (7, 1).
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord (3, 8).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles = [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 4, 1, 7>
- <2, 4, 3, 1>
- <4, 7, 1, 3>
- <6, 7, 4, 3>
