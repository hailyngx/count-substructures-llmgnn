Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 12, 7, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 9, 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 6, 12, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 12, 3, 1>
- Cycle 5: <3, 14, 11, 10, 3>
- Cycle 6: <4, 9, 8, 13, 4>
- Cycle 7: <4, 9, 11, 10, 4>
- Cycle 8: <4, 0, 7, 8, 4>
- Cycle 9: <5, 11, 14, 1, 5>
- Cycle 10: <9, 8, 7, 12, 9>
- Cycle 11: <9, 4, 13, 14, 9>
- Cycle 12: <10, 11, 14, 13, 10>
- Cycle 13: <11, 14, 13, 12, 11>
  
Step 2: Checking for each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycle 1: <0, (7, 12), 5>
- Chordal cycle 2: <0, (8, 9), 4>
- Chordal cycle 3: <0, (1, 6), 12>
- Chordal cycle 4: <1, (12, 3), 6>
- Chordal cycle 5: <3, (10, 11), 14>
- Chordal cycle 6: <4, (8, 13), 9>
- Chordal cycle 7: <4, (11, 10), 9>
- Chordal cycle 8: <4, (7, 8), 0>
- Chordal cycle 9: <5, (1, 14), 11>
- Chordal cycle 10: <7, (8, 9), 12>
- Chordal cycle 11: <9, (13, 14), 4>
- Chordal cycle 12: <10, (13, 14), 11>
- Chordal cycle 13: <11, (12, 13), 14>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
