Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 0, 21, 14, 26, 13, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 16, 25, 2, 5, 22, 19, 12, 11, 19, 22, 5, 6, 9, 13, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 16, 29, 23, 24, 15, 7, 26, 14, 21, 0, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 16, 29, 23, 24, 15, 7, 29, 10, 27, 26, 14, 3, 8, 28, 18, 0, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 5, 28, 13, 9, 6, 5, 2, 20, 17, 20, 2, 25, 16, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 4, 5, 28, 18, 0, 21, 14, 26, 7, 15, 24, 23, 29, 10, 8, 3, 14, 3, 8, 10, 25, 16, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 16, 29, 23>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 0, 21, 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As there are 6 cycles found and 2 of them are chordal, the number of chordless cycles is 4. Therefore, the final count is [4].
