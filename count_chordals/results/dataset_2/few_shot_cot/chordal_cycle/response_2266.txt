Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 4, 8, 9>
2. <0, 4, 3, 5>
3. <0, 5, 3, 2>
4. <0, 7, 9, 4>
5. <0, 7, 8, 5>
6. <1, 4, 3, 2>
7. <1, 4, 8, 9>
8. <1, 8, 5, 0>
9. <2, 3, 5, 6>
10. <2, 3, 4, 8>
11. <2, 5, 8, 7>
12. <2, 6, 1, 8>
13. <3, 4, 1, 8>
14. <4, 1, 6, 5>
15. <4, 3, 2, 6>
16. <5, 6, 1, 8>
17. <5, 8, 4, 9>
18. <7, 8, 5, 0>
19. <7, 9, 4, 1>
20. <9, 7, 8, 4>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, 4, 3, 2> (Chord: (1, 8))
2. <1, 4, 8, 9> (Chord: (4, 0))
3. <3, 4, 1, 8> (Chord: (3, 2))
4. <4, 1, 6, 5> (Chord: (1, 8))
5. <5, 6, 1, 8> (Chord: (5, 0))
6. <7, 8, 5, 0> (Chord: (7, 9))

Step 3:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Hence, the number of chordless cycles is [20-6] = [14].
