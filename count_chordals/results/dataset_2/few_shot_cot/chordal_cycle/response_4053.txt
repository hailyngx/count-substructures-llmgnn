Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0,7,9,5,1,0)
- Cycle 2: (1,5,2,9,6,1)
- Cycle 3: (2,6,3,8,5,2)
- Cycle 4: (4,7,9,6,2,4)
- Cycle 5: (5,2,4,1,9,5)
- Cycle 6: (8,3,6,9,5,8)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (7,5)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (2,6)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (3,8)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (9,6)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (2,4)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (3,6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <0, (7,5), 9, 1)>
2. <1, (2,6), 5, 9)>
3. <2, (3,8), 6, 5)>
4. <4, (9,6), 2, 7)>
5. <5, (2,4), 1, 9)>
6. <8, (3,6), 9, 5)>
