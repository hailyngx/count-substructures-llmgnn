Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 8, 5, 2>
- <0, 8, 4, 6>
- <0, 7, 5, 2>
- <0, 7, 6, 4>
- <1, 3, 5, 2>
- <1, 3, 4, 6>
- <2, 5, 8, 0>
- <2, 5, 7, 6>
- <3, 5, 7, 0>
- <3, 5, 9, 0>
- <3, 5, 8, 0>
- <3, 7, 0, 9>
- <3, 7, 6, 4>
- <4, 6, 7, 0>
- <4, 6, 3, 1>
- <5, 7, 0, 9>
- <5, 7, 2, 1>
- <8, 4, 6, 7>
- <8, 4, 3, 1>
- <8, 5, 2, 1>

Step 2:
Checking for chords:
- <0, 8, 5, 2> has a chord (8, 2)
- <0, 7, 5, 2> has a chord (7, 5)
- <1, 3, 5, 2> has a chord (3, 5)
- <2, 5, 8, 0> has a chord (5, 0)
- <3, 5, 7, 0> has a chord (5, 0)
- <3, 7, 0, 9> has a chord (7, 9)
- <4, 6, 7, 0> has a chord (6, 7)
- <5, 7, 2, 1> has a chord (7, 1)
- <8, 5, 2, 1> has a chord (5, 1)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles = [9]
