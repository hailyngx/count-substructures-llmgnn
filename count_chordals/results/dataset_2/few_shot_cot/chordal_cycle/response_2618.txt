Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <3, 15, 25, 1>
- Cycle 2: <3, 15, 24, 18>
- Cycle 3: <3, 13, 12, 2>
- Cycle 4: <3, 13, 28, 4>

- Cycle 8: <6, 9, 13, 3>
- Cycle 9: <6, 9, 22, 21>
- Cycle 10: <9, 13, 12, 8>

- Cycle 36: <4, 28, 13, 12>
- Cycle 37: <7, 10, 11, 21>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, 15, 25, 1, (2, 29)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, 13, 28, 4, (20, 16)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <22, 25, 1, 2, (29, 19)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, 23, 7, 10, (11, 21)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <26, 17, 23, 8, (15, 24)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 37 cycles found in total, and there are 5 chordal cycles. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is 37 - 5 = [32].
