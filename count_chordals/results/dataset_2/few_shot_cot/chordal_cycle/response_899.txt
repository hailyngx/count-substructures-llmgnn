Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 9, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more where every edge exists:
- Cycle <0, 4, 7, 8, 0>
- Cycle <1, 3, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle <2, 1, 3, 6, 2>
- Cycle <4, 2, 1, 5, 4>
- Cycle <5, 4, 7, 8, 5>
- Cycle <6, 3, 7, 8, 6>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 4, 7, 8, 0> (Chord: 7-8)
- Cycle <1, 3, 7, 4, 1> (Chord: 3-4)
- Cycle <4, 2, 1, 5, 4> (Chord: 1-5)
- Cycle <5, 4, 7, 8, 5> (Chord: 4-8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found.

Final Answer: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 4, 7, 8, 0> (Chord: 7-8)
<1, 3, 7, 4, 1> (Chord: 3-4)
<4, 2, 1, 5, 4> (Chord: 1-5)
<5, 4, 7, 8, 5> (Chord: 4-8)
