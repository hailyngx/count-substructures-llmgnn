Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 7, 4, 9, 1, 2)
- Cycle 3: (3, 6, 1, 9, 5, 3)
- Cycle 4: (4, 9, 5, 2, 8, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 2, 7, 4, 8, 5)
- Cycle 6: (6, 3, 5, 2, 7, 6)
- Cycle 7: (7, 4, 9, 1, 6, 7)
- Cycle 8: (8, 4, 7, 2, 5, 8)
- Cycle 9: (9, 1, 6, 3, 5, 9)
- Cycle 10: (0, 2, 5, 9, 4, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (2, 4)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (2, 5)
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 9 has exactly one chord: (3, 5)
- Cycle 10 has exactly one chord: (2, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Putting this final number inside brackets, the answer is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 7, 4, 9, (1, 7)>
<2, 7, 4, 9, (2, 4)>
<3, 6, 1, 9, (1, 9)>
<4, 9, 5, 2, (5, 8)>
<5, 2, 7, 4, (4, 7)>
<6, 3, 5, 2, (2, 5)>
<7, 4, 9, 1, (1, 9)>
<8, 4, 7, 2, (4, 7)>
<9, 1, 6, 3, (3, 5)>
<0, 2, 5, 9, (2, 9)>
