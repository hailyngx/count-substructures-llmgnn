Response:
Step 1: 
There are many cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph, but only one unique chordal 4-cycle is found. 

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, the chordal 4-cycle is <3, 15, 1, 2> with a chord between nodes 1 and 15.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, the final answer is [0].
