Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 17, 28, 0> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 17, 28, 12, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 17, 28, 12, 29, 8, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 2, 20, 29, 8, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 2, 20, 29, 12, 28, 0, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 2, 20, 29, 12, 28, 17, 0, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 20, 29, 12, 28, 17, 0, 1, 10, 19, 7, 15, 24, 5, 23, 13, 6, 18, 25, 9, 7, 19, 16, 27, 21, 10>
- Cycle 8: <2, 20, 29, 12, 28, 17, 0, 1, 10, 19, 16, 27, 21, 13, 6, 22, 18>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (0, 28) and (17, 28)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (28, 12)
- Cycle 3 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 4 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 5 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 6 does not have exactly one chord.
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (6, 13)
- Cycle 8 does not have exactly one chord.
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There is 1 chordless cycle found, which is <0, 1, 2, 20, 29, 12, 28, 17, 0>. 

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
