Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 5, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 4, 9)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 5, 4)
- Cycle 3: (1, 3, 5, 6)
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 8, 7)
- Cycle 5: (1, 5, 8, 9)
- Cycle 6: (3, 4, 6, 1)
- Cycle 7: (3, 4, 9, 8)
- Cycle 8: (3, 5, 8, 9)
- Cycle 9: (4, 5, 6, 1)
- Cycle 10: (4, 5, 8, 9)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (3, 5)
- Cycle 3 is not a chordal cycle
- Cycle 4 is not a chordal cycle
- Cycle 5 is not a chordal cycle
- Cycle 6 is not a chordal cycle
- Cycle 7 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 8 is not a chordal cycle
- Cycle 9 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 10 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (5, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 3, 4, 9> (chord: (3, 9))
<1, 3, 5, 4> (chord: (3, 5))
<4, 5, 6, 1> (chord: (5, 6))
<4, 5, 8, 9> (chord: (5, 8))
