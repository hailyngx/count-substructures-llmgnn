Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 14, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 12, 5, 3, 10, 6, 2, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 14, 7, 6, 2, 4, 12, 13, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 12, 5, 3, 10, 8, 14, 1, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 8, 10, 11, 14, 7, 13, 12, 5, 3, 9, 4, 2, 6, 0, 1>

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
- <0, 1, 14, 8, 4, 0> has a chord: (1, 8)
- <0, 1, 12, 5, 3, 10, 6, 2, 4, 0> has a chord: (5, 10)
- <0, 1, 14, 7, 6, 2, 4, 12, 13, 0> has a chord: (6, 12)
- <0, 4, 12, 5, 3, 10, 8, 14, 1, 0> has a chord: (5, 10)
- <1, 8, 10, 11, 14, 7, 13, 12, 5, 3, 9, 4, 2, 6, 0, 1> has a chord: (3, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
