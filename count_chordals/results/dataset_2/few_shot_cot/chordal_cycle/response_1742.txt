Node 7 is connected to node 14, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, 11, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 11, 14, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 5, 8, and node 1
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 2, 13, 0, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 12, 0, 14, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 8, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 4, 3, 12, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 6, 3, 12, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 11, 9, 6, 3, 12, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 8, 11, 9, 6, 3, 12, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 8, 5, 4, 14, 13, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 4, 5, 8, 1, 13, 14, 7, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 5, 11, 9, 10, 3, 12, 13, 14, 7, 2>
- Cycle 9: <3, 4, 5, 8, 1, 11, 9, 6, 12, 13, 14, 7, 3>
  
Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has chord (3, 4).
- Cycle 3 has chord (0, 6).
- Cycle 4 has chord (0, 12).
- Cycle 5 has chord (1, 9).
- Cycle 6 has chord (8, 14).
- Cycle 7 has chord (2, 13).
- Cycle 8 has no chords as there are two chords.
- Cycle 9 has no chords as there are two chords.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
