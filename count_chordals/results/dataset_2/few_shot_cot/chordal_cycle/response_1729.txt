Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (2, 18) (2, 8) (2, 14) (2, 11) (18, 2) (18, 14) (18, 8) (4, 19) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 11) (8, 2) (8, 18) (8, 3) (5, 13) (5, 19) (5, 17) (5, 15) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 16) (13, 1) (13, 19) (0, 17) (7, 3) (19, 4) (19, 5) (19, 13) (19, 11) (16, 4) (16, 13) (16, 15) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 6) (11, 2) (11, 4) (11, 19) (14, 2) (14, 18) (14, 3) (14, 1) (15, 5) (15, 16) (15, 9) (9, 15) (9, 1) (12, 13) (12, 1) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 9) (1, 12) (10, 4) (10, 6) (6, 3) (6, 10) (17, 5) (17, 0)

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: <2, 18, 8, 3> 
- Cycle 2: <2, 11, 4, 19>
- Cycle 3: <2, 14, 3, 6>
- Cycle 4: <2, 14, 1, 13>
- Cycle 5: <4, 19, 13, 16>
- Cycle 6: <4, 11, 2, 18>
- Cycle 7: <4, 11, 19, 5>
- Cycle 8: <5, 19, 13, 1>
- Cycle 9: <5, 17, 0, 5>
- Cycle 10: <13, 19, 4, 16>
- Cycle 11: <13, 1, 14, 2>
- Cycle 12: <15, 5, 17, 0>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<4, 19, 13, 16> with the chord (4, 16)

Step 3:
There is only 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
