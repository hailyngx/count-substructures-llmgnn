Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 18, 4, 13>
- Cycle 2: <1, 17, 3, 5>
- Cycle 3: <1, 10, 5, 15>
- Cycle 4: <1, 12, 8, 10>
- Cycle 5: <2, 17, 3, 19>
- Cycle 6: <4, 18, 11, 9>
- Cycle 7: <4, 11, 8, 10>
- Cycle 8: <6, 10, 1, 12>
- Cycle 9: <6, 15, 5, 3>
- Cycle 10: <6, 19, 3, 17>
- Cycle 11: <11, 18, 4, 14>
- Cycle 12: <13, 16, 0, 18>
- Cycle 13: <13, 4, 14, 3>
- Cycle 14: <15, 9, 11, 18>

Step 2: Checking for chords:
- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <0, 4>.
- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <1, 3>.
- Cycle 3 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <5, 15>.
- Cycle 4 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <1, 8>.
- Cycle 5 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <3, 19>.
- Cycle 6 is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 7 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <4, 8>.
- Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <1, 12>.
- Cycle 9 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <5, 15>.
- Cycle 10 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <3, 17>.
- Cycle 11 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <11, 14>.
- Cycle 12 is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 13 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <4, 14>.
- Cycle 14 is not a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Putting the final number inside brackets: [9].
