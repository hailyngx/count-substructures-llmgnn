Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 1-7-4-5-1
- Cycle 2: 2-6-7-1-2
- Cycle 3: 3-7-4-5-3
- Cycle 4: 0-9-2-6-0
- Cycle 5: 6-8-0-3-6
- Cycle 6: 9-1-7-4-9
- Cycle 7: 2-5-4-7-2
- Cycle 8: 9-1-6-5-9
- Cycle 9: 8-6-7-4-8
- Cycle 10: 0-8-1-7-0
- Cycle 11: 0-2-5-1-0
- Cycle 12: 3-1-8-0-3
- Cycle 13: 0-9-1-5-0
- Cycle 14: 3-7-6-2-3

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (7, 6), 5>
- <2, (7, 1), 6>
- <4, (7, 5), 3>
- <6, (2, 7), 1>
- <7, (4, 5), 3>
- <9, (1, 7), 6>
- <5, (2, 4), 7>
- <8, (1, 6), 7>
- <0, (2, 5), 1>
- <3, (0, 8), 1>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [5].
