Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycles with length 4:
            <0, 4, 9, 8>
            <0, 4, 12, 13>
            <0, 4, 1, 6>
            <0, 2, 7, 13>
            <0, 12, 13, 7>
            <1, 4, 9, 8>
            <1, 4, 0, 2>
            <1, 6, 5, 8>
            <2, 0, 4, 9>
            <2, 7, 6, 1>
            <2, 13, 12, 4>
            <3, 5, 8, 9>
            <3, 7, 6, 1>
            <3, 13, 12, 4>
            <4, 12, 13, 7>
            <5, 8, 9, 4>
            <5, 6, 1, 4>
            <6, 1, 4, 12>
            <7, 2, 0, 4>
            <7, 3, 13, 12>
            <8, 5, 6, 1>
            <9, 4, 1, 6>
            <10, 4, 9, 8>
        - Cycles with length 5:
            <0, 4, 9, 8, 5>
            <0, 2, 7, 6, 1>
            <1, 4, 9, 8, 5>
            <3, 5, 8, 9, 4>
            <4, 12, 13, 7, 6>
            <5, 6, 1, 4, 9>
            <7, 2, 0, 4, 9>
            <9, 8, 5, 6, 1>
        
Step 2: Checking for chordal 4-cycles:
        <0, 4, 12, 13>, Chord: (4, 12) or (0, 13)
        <0, 4, 1, 6>, Chord: (4, 1)
        <0, 2, 7, 13>, Chord: (0, 7)
        <0, 12, 13, 7>, Chord: (13, 7)
        <1, 4, 9, 8>, Chord: (4, 9)
        <2, 0, 4, 9>, Chord: (0, 9)
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
