Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2: 
- Since there are no cycles found in the graph, we cannot determine any chordal 4-cycles.

Step 3:
- As we did not find any chordal 4-cycles, the count of chordless cycles is 0.

Therefore, the answer is [0].
