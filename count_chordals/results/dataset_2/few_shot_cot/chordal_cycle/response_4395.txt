Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
<3, 6, 9, 5, 3>
<3, 6, 9, 8, 5, 3>
<6, 9, 5, 8, 6>
<6, 9, 8, 5, 6>
<3, 1, 5, 8, 3>
<3, 1, 8, 5, 3>
<1, 5, 8, 4, 1>
<1, 5, 0, 7, 1>
<1, 8, 4, 6, 1>
<1, 8, 5, 9, 1>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, 6, 9, 8, 5, 3> with a chord (6, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 9 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
