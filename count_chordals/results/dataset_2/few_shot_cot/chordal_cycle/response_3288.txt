- <1, 3, 8, 6, 1> has one chord: (3, 8)
- <2, 5, 13, 8, 2> has one chord: (5, 8)
- <3, 1, 18, 17, 3> has one chord: (1, 17)
- <4, 14, 0, 2, 4> has one chord: (14, 2)
- <5, 9, 2, 17, 5> has one chord: (9, 17)
- <6, 16, 11, 0, 6> has one chord: (16, 0)
- <10, 11, 16, 6, 10> has one chord: (11, 6)
- <11, 16, 19, 6, 11> has one chord: (16, 19)
- <12, 10, 17, 0, 12> has one chord: (10, 17)
- <13, 5, 2, 17, 13> has one chord: (5, 17)
