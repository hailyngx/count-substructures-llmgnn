Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. <0, 10, 14, 9>
2. <0, 10, 5, 8>
3. <0, 12, 4, 5>
4. <1, 3, 8, 5>
5. <3, 6, 0, 5>
6. <3, 4, 12, 7>
7. <4, 8, 5, 10>
8. <7, 11, 6, 13>
9. <9, 1, 3, 13>
10. <10, 11, 7, 14>
11. <11, 6, 3, 1>
12. <12, 4, 8, 11>
13. <13, 3, 1, 9>
14. <14, 10, 5, 4>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, 3, 8, 5> (chord: (3, 8))
2. <3, 4, 12, 7> (chord: (4, 7))
3. <4, 8, 5, 10> (chord: (5, 8))

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [11].
