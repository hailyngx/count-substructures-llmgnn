Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 present in the graph. Here are some of them:
1. <0, 5, 2, 11>
2. <0, 11, 6, 10>
3. <1, 7, 8, 6>
4. <2, 5, 13, 4>
5. <3, 11, 6, 14>
6. <4, 13, 3, 14>
7. <5, 2, 4, 6>
8. <6, 11, 2, 5>
9. <7, 1, 12, 9>
10. <8, 6, 4, 13>
11. <9, 12, 1, 10>
12. <10, 6, 4, 13>
13. <11, 0, 5, 2>
14. <12, 9, 5, 13>
15. <13, 4, 6, 10>
16. <14, 7, 1, 8>

Step 2:
Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, (5, 11), 6, 10>
2. <7, (1, 8), 6, 14>
3. <2, (5, 13), 4, 6>
4. <3, (11, 6), 14, 4>
5. <4, (13, 3), 14, 6>
6. <5, (2, 4), 13, 6>
7. <6, (11, 2), 5, 9>
8. <1, (7, 12), 9, 10>
9. <8, (6, 13), 4, 10>
10. <9, (12, 1), 7, 14>
11. <10, (6, 13), 4, 3>
12. <12, (9, 5), 13, 4>
13. <13, (4, 6), 10, 2>
14. <14, (7, 1), 8, 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we get [14].
