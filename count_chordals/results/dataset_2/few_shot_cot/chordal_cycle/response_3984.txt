Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Potential cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
1. <0, 1, 2, 3, 0>
2. <0, 2, 3, 7, 4, 9, 5, 8, 0>
3. <1, 6, 5, 9, 2, 1>
4. <2, 8, 7, 4, 9, 3, 2>
5. <4, 7, 3, 1, 6, 5, 4>
6. <5, 6, 7, 4, 5>
7. <9, 3, 1, 2, 9>
8. <9, 5, 8, 7, 9>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 2, 3, 7, 4, 9, 5, 8, 0> has one chord: (4, 5)
2. <1, 6, 5, 9, 2, 1> has one chord: (5, 9)
3. <2, 8, 7, 4, 9, 3, 2> has one chord: (4, 7)
4. <4, 7, 3, 1, 6, 5, 4> has one chord: (1, 6)
5. <5, 6, 7, 4, 5> has one chord: (4, 7)
6. <9, 3, 1, 2, 9> has one chord: (1, 2)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found gives us [6].
