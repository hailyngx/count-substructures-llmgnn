Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. Some of them are:
1. Cycle <6, 9, 13, 8>
2. Cycle <2, 11, 19, 17>
3. Cycle <4, 3, 17, 18>
4. Cycle <8, 0, 15, 11>
5. Cycle <10, 1, 12, 4>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
1. Cycle <6, 9, 13, 8> has chord (9, 13).
2. Cycle <2, 11, 19, 17> has chord (11, 19).
3. Cycle <4, 3, 17, 18> has chord (3, 17).
4. Cycle <8, 0, 15, 11> has chord (0, 15).
5. Cycle <10, 1, 12, 4> has chord (1, 12).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
