Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 1, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 5: <3, 5, 1, 4, 3>
- Cycle 6: <3, 5, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle 7: <3, 5, 9, 6, 3>
- Cycle 8: <4, 7, 5, 1, 4>
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 9, 5, 4>
- Cycle 10: <8, 4, 7, 5, 8>
- Cycle 11: <8, 4, 0, 5, 8>
- Cycle 12: <8, 4, 1, 5, 8>
- Cycle 13: <8, 4, 0, 3, 8>
- Cycle 14: <8, 4, 7, 0, 8>
- Cycle 15: <8, 6, 2, 8, 6>
- Cycle 16: <8, 6, 3, 5, 8>
- Cycle 17: <8, 6, 9, 5, 8>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord <1, 4>
- Cycle 2 has chord <5, 9>
- Cycle 3 has chord <5, 7>
- Cycle 4 has chord <1, 7>
- Cycle 5 has chord <5, 1>
- Cycle 6 has chord <5, 7>
- Cycle 7 has chord <5, 9>
- Cycle 8 has chord <5, 7>
- Cycle 9 has chord <5, 7>
- Cycle 10 has chord <4, 5>
- Cycle 11 has chord <4, 5>
- Cycle 12 has chord <4, 5>
- Cycle 13 has chord <0, 4>
- Cycle 14 has chord <4, 0>
- Cycle 15 has chord <6, 8>
- Cycle 16 has chord <5, 3>
- Cycle 17 has chord <5, 9>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 17 cycles with exactly one chord, hence the number of chordless cycles is [0].
