Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <5, (8, 10), 3>. 

Now, let's count the number of chordless cycles:

Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 8 - 13 - 6 - 5 (Chord: 8 - 13)
- Cycle 2: 5 - 13 - 6 - 1 - 5 (Chord: 6 - 1)
- Cycle 3: 5 - 13 - 6 - 4 - 5 (Chord: 6 - 4)
- Cycle 4: 5 - 8 - 10 - 11 - 5 (Chord: 10 - 11)
- Cycle 5: 3 - 5 - 8 - 13 - 3 (Chord: 5 - 8)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle.
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (8, 13)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (6, 1)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (6, 4)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (10, 11)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (5, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordless cycles in the graph is [0].
