Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
- <0, 5, 8, 1> 
- <0, 5, 9, 4> 
- <0, 4, 6, 8> 
- <0, 3, 8, 1> 
- <1, 4, 9, 7> 
- <2, 3, 7, 8> 

Step 2: 
- <0, 5, 8, 1> has exactly one chord (0, 1)
- <0, 5, 9, 4> has exactly one chord (5, 4)
- <1, 4, 9, 7> has exactly one chord (4, 7)

Step 3: 
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
