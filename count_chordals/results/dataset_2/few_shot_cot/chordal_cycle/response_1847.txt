Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. <0, 7, 14, 6>
2. <0, 7, 13, 1>
3. <0, 1, 2, 6>
4. <0, 2, 14, 5>
5. <0, 3, 9, 4>
6. <0, 3, 10, 13>
7. <1, 7, 13, 4>
8. <1, 7, 14, 5>
9. <1, 11, 12, 5>
10. <1, 11, 3, 0>
11. <2, 0, 7, 6>
12. <2, 0, 3, 9>
13. <2, 12, 11, 1>
14. <2, 14, 5, 12>
15. <3, 0, 7, 6>
16. <3, 0, 2, 14>
17. <3, 9, 12, 5>
18. <3, 10, 4, 9>
19. <4, 9, 12, 5>
20. <4, 9, 3, 11>
21. <4, 10, 13, 7>
22. <5, 12, 9, 4>
23. <5, 12, 11, 1>
24. <6, 7, 14, 2>
25. <7, 0, 3, 9>
26. <7, 1, 11, 3>
27. <8, 10, 4, 9>
28. <9, 3, 11, 1>
29. <10, 4, 13, 7>
30. <12, 5, 14, 7>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
<1, (2, 4), 5>
<3, (7, 9), 10>
<5, (11, 1), 12>
<6, (0, 14), 7>
<7, (3, 1), 11>
<8, (9, 13), 4>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we have a total of [6].
