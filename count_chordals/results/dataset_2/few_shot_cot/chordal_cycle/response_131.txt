Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 5, 9>
2. <0, 3, 4, 7>
3. <0, 3, 6, 8>
4. <0, 9, 5, 7>
5. <1, 4, 5, 7>
6. <2, 3, 4, 7>
7. <2, 3, 6, 8>
8. <2, 5, 7, 9>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 1, 5, 9> - chord: (1, 9)
2. <2, 5, 7, 9> - chord: (5, 9)

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, 1, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 7, 9>
