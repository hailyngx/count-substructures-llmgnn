Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, 10, (4, 14), 5>. Following the steps provided:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-13-3-7-2-5-14-11-4
- Cycle 2: 0-13-3-7-2-6-12-9-1
- Cycle 3: 1-3-7-11-4-8-6-2-5
- Cycle 4: 1-5-2-6-12-9-7-3-13
- Cycle 5: 2-7-3-13-0-10-4-11-14
- Cycle 6: 4-8-6-2-5-1-9-7-11
- Cycle 7: 4-10-0-13-3-7-11-14
- Cycle 8: 5-2-7-3-1-9-12-6-10
- Cycle 9: 6-8-4-11-14-5-2-7-3
- Cycle 10: 10-8-4-11-14-5-1-9-12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (4, 14)
- Cycle 2 has no chord
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has no chord
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has no chord
- Cycle 7 has chord (4, 14)
- Cycle 8 has no chord
- Cycle 9 has no chord
- Cycle 10 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 7 chordless cycles found, so the final number is [7].
