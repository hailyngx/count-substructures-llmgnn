Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- There are 4-cycles: <11, 16, 6, 14>, <11, 16, 14, 4>, <11, 16, 14, 13>, <11, 7, 18, 16>, <5, 11, 16, 14>, <5, 11, 7, 18>, <5, 19, 10, 17>, <9, 5, 11, 7>, <9, 5, 11, 16>, <9, 5, 19, 10>, <9, 13, 14, 16>, <14, 13, 9, 5>, <17, 10, 1, 15>, <17, 10, 19, 5>, <17, 18, 16, 14>, <17, 18, 16, 11>, <1, 15, 3, 9>, <2, 10, 17, 18>, <18, 7, 2, 10>, <7, 18, 16, 11>
- There are 5-cycles: <11, 16, 6, 0, 19>, <11, 16, 14, 4, 9>, <11, 16, 14, 13, 9>, <5, 11, 16, 14, 4>, <5, 11, 16, 14, 13>, <5, 19, 12, 8, 6>, <9, 5, 11, 7, 2>, <9, 5, 11, 16, 6>, <9, 5, 11, 16, 14>, <9, 5, 19, 12, 8>, <9, 13, 14, 16, 11>, <14, 13, 9, 5, 19>, <17, 10, 19, 12, 8>, <17, 10, 19, 12, 0>, <17, 18, 7, 2, 10>, <17, 18, 16, 11, 5>, <1, 15, 3, 9, 5>, <2, 10, 19, 12, 8>, <18, 7, 2, 10, 1>, <7, 18, 16, 11, 5>
- There is a 6-cycle: <11, 16, 6, 0, 8, 12>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The cycle <11, 16, 14, 4> has one chord (16, 14).
- The cycle <11, 16, 14, 13> has one chord (16, 14).
- The cycle <9, 5, 19, 10> has one chord (5, 10).
- The cycle <11, 7, 18, 16> has one chord (7, 16).
- The cycle <11, 16, 6, 14> has one chord (16, 6).
- The cycle <11, 16, 6, 0, 19> has one chord (6, 19).
- The cycle <17, 18, 7, 2, 10> has one chord (18, 2).
- The cycle <7, 18, 16, 11, 5> has one chord (18, 11).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 13 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [13].
