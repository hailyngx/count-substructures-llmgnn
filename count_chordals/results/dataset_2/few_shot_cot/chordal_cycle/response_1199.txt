Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-6-3-0
- Cycle 2: 1-0-5-9-4-1
- Cycle 3: 2-5-9-4-2
- Cycle 4: 2-5-6-3-2
- Cycle 5: 2-6-10-14-2
- Cycle 6: 3-6-10-7-3
- Cycle 7: 4-9-5-6-4
- Cycle 8: 4-9-12-11-4
- Cycle 9: 4-14-10-6-4
- Cycle 10: 7-3-6-5-7
- Cycle 11: 9-5-6-10-9
- Cycle 12: 10-6-3-2-10
- Cycle 13: 11-1-0-5-11
- Cycle 14: 12-9-5-13-12
- Cycle 15: 12-9-4-1-12
- Cycle 16: 12-11-7-3-12
- Cycle 17: 13-5-9-12-13
- Cycle 18: 14-0-5-9-14

Step 2:
Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: <2, 3>
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: <4, 5>
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: <6, 9>
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: <7, 8>
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord: <10, 11>
- Cycle 11 has exactly one chord: <12, 13>
- Cycle 15 has exactly one chord: <14, 15>
- Cycle 17 has exactly one chord: <16, 17>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 5, 6, 3>
- <1, 0, 5, 9>
- <2, 5, 9, 4>
- <3, 6, 10, 7>
- <11, 1, 0, 5>
- <12, 9, 5, 13>
- <14, 0, 5, 9>
