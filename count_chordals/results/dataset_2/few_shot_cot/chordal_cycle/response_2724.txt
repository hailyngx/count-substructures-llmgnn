Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <0, 7, 10, 6>
2. <0, 7, 17, 14>
3. <0, 7, 17, 18>
4. <0, 6, 4, 12>
5. <0, 6, 14, 13>
6. <0, 18, 17, 4>
7. <1, 9, 8, 5>
8. <3, 13, 15, 19>
9. <3, 13, 14, 17>
10. <3, 4, 6, 10>
11. <4, 6, 10, 12>
12. <5, 8, 19, 15>
13. <7, 10, 12, 16>
14. <8, 19, 11, 16>
15. <9, 12, 16, 11>
16. <13, 14, 17, 18>
17. <10, 12, 16, 11>
18. <11, 16, 12, 4>
19. <13, 14, 6, 10>
20. <14, 17, 18, 3>
21. <19, 11, 10, 6>
22. <19, 15, 13, 3>
23. <17, 14, 6, 0>
24. <17, 18, 3, 13>

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <4, 6, 10, 12>
2. Step 3: There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [22].
