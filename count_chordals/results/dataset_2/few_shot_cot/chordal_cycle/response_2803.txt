Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
  - Cycle 1: <0, 5, 2, 8, 4>
  - Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 4, 8>
  - Cycle 3: <0, 5, 9, 1, 8>
  - Cycle 4: <0, 5, 6, 1, 8>
  - Cycle 5: <0, 4, 9, 1, 6>
  - Cycle 6: <1, 9, 4, 8, 2>
  - Cycle 7: <1, 9, 5, 6, 0>
  - Cycle 8: <1, 6, 7, 3, 8>
  - Cycle 9: <2, 5, 9, 1, 6>
  - Cycle 10: <3, 5, 9, 4, 8>
  - Cycle 11: <3, 5, 2, 8, 7>
  - Cycle 12: <3, 0, 5, 9, 4>
  - Cycle 13: <4, 9, 5, 6, 0>
  - Cycle 14: <4, 8, 7, 6, 1>
  - Cycle 15: <5, 9, 4, 0, 6>
  - Cycle 16: <5, 6, 1, 8, 2>
  - Cycle 17: <5, 2, 8, 7, 3>
  
Step 2:
- Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles (cycles with a single chord) are:
  - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 5, 2, 8> with chord (5, 8)
  - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 4> with chord (5, 9)
  - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 9, 5, 6> with chord (9, 6)
  - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, 5, 2, 8> with chord (5, 2)
  
Step 3:
- Finally, the number of chordless cycles found is [13].
