Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, 0, 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- <0, 4, 9, 2, 0> (length 4)
- <1, 3, 8, 1> (length 3)
- <1, 3, 7, 0, 1> (length 4)
- <1, 4, 8, 1> (length 3)
- <1, 4, 9, 8, 1> (length 4)
- <1, 8, 5, 3, 1> (length 4)
- <2, 3, 1, 4, 2> (length 4)
- <2, 3, 8, 1, 4, 2> (length 5)
- <2, 4, 1, 3, 2> (length 4)
- <2, 4, 8, 1, 3, 2> (length 5)
- <2, 6, 5, 8, 2> (length 4)
- <2, 6, 5, 3, 2> (length 4)
- <2, 7, 3, 1, 4, 2> (length 5)
- <2, 7, 3, 8, 1, 4, 2> (length 6)
- <2, 9, 4, 1, 3, 2> (length 5)
- <2, 9, 4, 8, 1, 3, 2> (length 6)
- <3, 1, 4, 2, 3> (length 4)
- <3, 1, 8, 4, 2, 3> (length 5)
- <4, 1, 3, 8, 4> (length 4)
- <4, 1, 8, 5, 4> (length 4)
- <4, 2, 3, 1, 4> (length 4)
- <4, 2, 3, 8, 5, 4> (length 5)
- <4, 9, 8, 1, 4> (length 4)
- <5, 3, 1, 8, 5> (length 4)
- <5, 3, 7, 0, 5> (length 4)
- <5, 8, 1, 3, 5> (length 4)
- <7, 3, 1, 4, 7> (length 4)
- <7, 3, 2, 4, 7> (length 4)
- <8, 1, 3, 7, 8> (length 4)
- <8, 1, 4, 9, 8> (length 4)
- <9, 4, 1, 3, 9> (length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Only <2, 3, 1, 4, 2> is a chordal 4-cycle with the chord (1,4).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
