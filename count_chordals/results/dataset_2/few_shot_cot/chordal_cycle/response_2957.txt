Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <3, 10, 14, 17, 13>
- <3, 10, 14, 17, 13, 5>
- <3, 10, 14, 17, 13, 15, 6>
- <4, 6, 15, 13>
- <4, 6, 15, 13, 5>
- <4, 6, 15, 13, 17>
- <6, 15, 13, 17>
- <6, 15, 13, 5>
- <6, 15, 13, 17, 14>
- <7, 0, 5, 13>
- <7, 0, 5, 13, 17>
- <7, 0, 5, 13, 17, 14>
- <7, 5, 13, 14>
- <7, 5, 13, 17>
- <7, 5, 13, 17, 14>
- <15, 13, 17, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, 10, 14, 17, 13> has a chord: (14, 17)
- <3, 10, 14, 17, 13, 15, 6> has a chord: (13, 17)
- <4, 6, 15, 13, 5> has a chord: (6, 15)
- <7, 0, 5, 13, 17> has a chord: (7, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [12]
