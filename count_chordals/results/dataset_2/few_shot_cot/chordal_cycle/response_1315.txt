Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 9 chordless cycles found, so the final number inside brackets is [9].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, 14, 12, 7>
<1, 14, 0, 17>
<1, 14, 13, 3>
<1, 5, 4, 7>
<9, 0, 17, 3>
<6, 8, 18, 0>
<6, 8, 18, 7>
<11, 2, 4, 7>
<5, 4, 7, 15>
