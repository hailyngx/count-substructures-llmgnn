Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 9, 1, 0> 
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 4, 8, 1> 
- Cycle 3: <2, 3, 1, 9, 2> 
- Cycle 4: <7, 1, 9, 5, 7> 

Step 2: 
- Checking cycle 1: <0, 5, 9, 1, 0> has a chord (5, 1)
- Checking cycle 2: <1, 3, 4, 8, 1> has a chord (3, 8)
- Checking cycle 3: <2, 3, 1, 9, 2> has a chord (3, 9)
- Checking cycle 4: <7, 1, 9, 5, 7> has a chord (1, 5)

Step 3: 
- There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
