Response:
Step 1: 
There are a total of 8 cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
1. Cycle: <0, 6, 4, 2, 0> 
2. Cycle: <1, 7, 4, 2, 1> 
3. Cycle: <2, 5, 14, 12, 2> 
4. Cycle: <3, 1, 7, 4, 3> 
5. Cycle: <4, 7, 6, 0, 4> 
6. Cycle: <8, 5, 14, 10, 8> 
7. Cycle: <9, 8, 4, 7, 9> 
8. Cycle: <10, 12, 14, 2, 10> 

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 6, 4, 2, 0> has chord (4, 6).
- Cycle <1, 7, 4, 2, 1> has chord (1, 4).
- Cycle <3, 1, 7, 4, 3> has chord (1, 4).
- Cycle <4, 7, 6, 0, 4> has chord (0, 6).
- Cycle <9, 8, 4, 7, 9> has chord (8, 7).
- Cycle <10, 12, 14, 2, 10> has chord (12, 14).

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <2, 5, 14, 12, 2>
2. <8, 5, 14, 10, 8>
