Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 7, 5, 4> (missing edge 0-4)
- Cycle <0, 7, 5, 8> (missing edge 0-8)
- Cycle <1, 6, 9, 0> (missing edge 1-0)
- Cycle <1, 6, 8, 5> (missing edge 1-5)
- Cycle <1, 12, 8, 5> (missing edge 1-8)
- Cycle <2, 7, 13, 12> (missing edge 2-12)
- Cycle <2, 13, 7, 0> (missing edge 2-0)
- Cycle <4, 5, 7, 0> (missing edge 4-0)
- Cycle <5, 4, 14, 6> (missing edge 5-6)
- Cycle <6, 14, 9, 0> (missing edge 6-0)
- Cycle <7, 0, 8, 12> (missing edge 7-12)
- Cycle <8, 6, 1, 12> (missing edge 8-1)
- Cycle <9, 6, 1, 12> (missing edge 9-12)
- Cycle <10, 0, 7, 13> (missing edge 10-13)
- Cycle <13, 7, 2, 12> (missing edge 13-12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycle <0, 7, 5, 4> (chord: 5-7)
- Chordal cycle <0, 7, 5, 8> (chord: 0-8)
- Chordal cycle <1, 6, 8, 5> (chord: 1-5)
- Chordal cycle <2, 7, 13, 12> (chord: 2-13)
- Chordal cycle <4, 5, 7, 0> (chord: 0-7)
- Chordal cycle <5, 4, 14, 6> (chord: 4-6)
- Chordal cycle <6, 14, 9, 0> (chord: 6-9)
- Chordal cycle <7, 0, 8, 12> (chord: 7-8)
- Chordal cycle <8, 6, 1, 12> (chord: 1-6)
- Chordal cycle <9, 6, 1, 12> (chord: 9-1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 1 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
