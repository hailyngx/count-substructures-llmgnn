- Chordal cycle: <0, 23, 5, 12>  Chord: (23, 12)
- Chordal cycle: <0, 23, 10, 29>  Chord: (23, 29)
- Chordal cycle: <0, 1, 16, 11>  Chord: (1, 11)
- Chordal cycle: <2, 11, 7, 26>  Chord: (11, 26)
- Chordal cycle: <2, 18, 5, 12>  Chord: (18, 12)
- Chordal cycle: <3, 16, 21, 24>  Chord: (16, 24)
- Chordal cycle: <4, 27, 21, 16>  Chord: (27, 16)

- Chordal cycle: <5, 23, 0, 27>  Chord: (23, 27)
- Chordal cycle: <5, 23, 10, 29>  Chord: (23, 29)
- Chordal cycle: <6, 12, 4, 27>  Chord: (12, 27)
- Chordal cycle: <6, 12, 5, 18>  Chord: (12, 18)
- Chordal cycle: <7, 11, 2, 17>  Chord: (11, 17)
- Chordal cycle: <7, 26, 10, 0>  Chord: (26, 0)

- Chordal cycle: <8, 29, 21, 24>  Chord: (29, 24)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [20].
