Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 2, 5, 1> with chord (0, 5)
- Cycle 2: <0, 2, 3, 5> with chord (2, 3)
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 9, 5> with chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 7, 4> with chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 5: <2, 5, 7, 4> with chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 6: <3, 5, 7, 4> with chord (3, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Among the cycles listed above, cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 6, 9, 5>.
