Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <6, (0, 9), 13>.

Let's count the number of chordless cycles:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycles of length 4: 
  - (6, 9, 0, 13, 6)
  - (6, 0, 11, 14, 6)
  - (6, 13, 0, 9, 6)
  - (9, 0, 11, 14, 9)
  - (9, 6, 13, 0, 9)
  - (0, 6, 9, 17, 0)
  - (0, 9, 6, 13, 0)
  - (0, 11, 14, 1, 0)
  - (0, 13, 6, 9, 0)
  - (11, 0, 13, 6, 11)
  - (11, 14, 1, 2, 11)
  - (11, 17, 9, 6, 11)
  - (14, 11, 17, 9, 14)
  - (14, 1, 2, 18, 14)
  - (14, 6, 13, 0, 14)
  - (17, 9, 0, 11, 17)
  - (17, 11, 14, 1, 17)
  - (2, 1, 14, 11, 2)
  - (18, 2, 1, 14, 18)
  - (18, 12, 7, 4, 18)
  - (18, 8, 7, 4, 18)
  - (12, 7, 4, 19, 12)
  - (12, 19, 8, 16, 12)
  - (12, 1, 14, 11, 12)
  - (12, 18, 8, 16, 12)
  - (15, 10, 6, 13, 15)
  - (16, 8, 18, 12, 16)
  - (16, 19, 12, 1, 16)
  - (16, 1, 14, 11, 16)
  - (13, 6, 9, 0, 13)
- Cycles of length more than 4 are not available in the graph.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The cycle (6, 9, 0, 13, 6) has exactly one chord which is the edge between nodes 0 and 9.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- We found 1 chordal 4-cycle, so the number of chordless cycles is [0].
