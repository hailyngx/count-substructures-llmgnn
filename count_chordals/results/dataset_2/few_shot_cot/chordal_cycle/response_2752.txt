Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <0, (2, 3), 9>.

Now, let's count the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph. The total number of chordless 4-cycles is [4].
