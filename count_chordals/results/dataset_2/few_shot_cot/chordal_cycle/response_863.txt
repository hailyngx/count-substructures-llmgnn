Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 7, 3, 12>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 11, 2, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 2, 13, 3, 7>
- Cycle 4: <2, 13, 12, 3, 7>
- Cycle 5: <3, 7, 12, 11, 8>
- Cycle 6: <4, 1, 2, 13, 3>
- Cycle 7: <4, 1, 5, 7, 3>
- Cycle 8: <5, 0, 10, 6, 13>
- Cycle 9: <5, 0, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle 10: <8, 4, 1, 2, 13>
- Cycle 11: <9, 7, 3, 13, 2>
- Cycle 12: <10, 0, 9, 7, 3>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 2, (13, 3), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, 13, (3, 12), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, 1, (2, 13), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, 0, (9, 7), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <8, 4, (1, 2), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, 7, (3, 13), 2>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
Total number of unique chordal 4-cycles: [6]
