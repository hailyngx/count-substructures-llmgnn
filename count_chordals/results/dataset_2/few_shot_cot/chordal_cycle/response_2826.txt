Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

<1, 7, 18, 19, 2> - No chord
<2, 19, 18, 7, 1> - No chord
<3, 18, 19, 10, 4> - No chord
<3, 18, 7, 1, 4> - No chord
<4, 10, 19, 18, 6> - No chord
<5, 0, 4, 12, 11> - No chord
<5, 0, 4, 2, 19> - No chord
<5, 8, 17, 14, 1> - No chord
<5, 3, 18, 19, 10> - No chord
<6, 17, 14, 1, 7> - No chord
<6, 17, 12, 4, 0> - No chord
<6, 18, 19, 10, 4> - No chord
<7, 0, 4, 2, 19> - No chord
<7, 18, 6, 17, 14> - No chord
<8, 17, 14, 1, 7> - No chord
<8, 11, 9, 14, 1> - No chord
<8, 5, 0, 7, 1> - No chord
<8, 6, 17, 14, 1> - No chord
<9, 14, 17, 6, 18> - No chord
<9, 11, 12, 17, 6> - No chord
<10, 19, 18, 7, 1> - No chord
<11, 9, 14, 17, 12> - No chord
<12, 17, 14, 1, 4> - No chord
<13, 7, 0, 4, 12> - No chord
<14, 17, 6, 18, 19> - No chord
<15, 9, 14, 17, 6> - No chord
<16, 18, 7, 1, 4> - No chord

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
Total = 36

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [36].
