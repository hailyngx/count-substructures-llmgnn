Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 2) (9, 10) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 13) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 12) (3, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 7) (11, 5) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 10) (12, 3) (12, 10) (12, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (14, 11) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 4) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 11) (4, 11) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6)

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
- As there are no cycles of length 4 or more, we cannot find any chordal 4-cycles.

Step 3:
- Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found in the graph is [0].
