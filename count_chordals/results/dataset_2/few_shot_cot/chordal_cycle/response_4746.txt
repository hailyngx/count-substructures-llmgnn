Step 2: Checking for chordal cycles:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <0, 5, 6, 1> (Chord: (0, 1))
- Chordal Cycle 2: <5, 8, 1, 7> (Chord: (8, 7))
- Chordal Cycle 3: <5, 8, 4, 7> (Chord: (4, 7))
- Chordal Cycle 4: <5, 8, 4, 3> (Chord: (4, 3))
- Chordal Cycle 5: <5, 0, 6, 1> (Chord: (0, 1))
- Chordal Cycle 6: <5, 7, 4, 8> (Chord: (7, 8))
- Chordal Cycle 7: <6, 1, 7, 4> (Chord: (1, 4))
- Chordal Cycle 8: <7, 5, 8, 4> (Chord: (5, 4))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph are:
<0, 5, 6, 1>, <5, 8, 1, 7>, <5, 8, 4, 7>, <5, 8, 4, 3>, <5, 0, 6, 1>, <5, 7, 4, 8>, <6, 1, 7, 4>, <7, 5, 8, 4>
