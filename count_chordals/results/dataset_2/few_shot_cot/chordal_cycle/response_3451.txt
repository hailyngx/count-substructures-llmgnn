Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <7, 10, 13, 11>
2. <4, 2, 1, 17>
3. <4, 2, 13, 11>
4. <4, 12, 1, 17>
5. <6, 12, 1, 17>
6. <1, 15, 9, 7>
7. <15, 9, 7, 4>
8. <15, 9, 7, 15>
9. <15, 7, 4, 12>
10. <15, 7, 4, 7>
11. <15, 7, 10, 13>
12. <15, 18, 14, 6>
13. <16, 14, 6, 12>
14. <16, 15, 9, 7>
15. <16, 15, 7, 10>
16. <17, 1, 12, 11>
17. <18, 15, 9, 7>
18. <18, 15, 7, 10>
19. <18, 14, 6, 12>
20. <19, 0, 6, 14>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:
1. <4, 2, 1, 17> (chord: (2, 1))
2. <4, 2, 13, 11> (chord: (2, 13))
3. <15, 7, 4, 12> (chord: (7, 12))
4. <15, 7, 4, 7> (chord: (7, 4))
5. <15, 7, 10, 13> (chord: (7, 10))
6. <16, 14, 6, 12> (chord: (14, 6))

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <4, 2, 1, 17>
2. <4, 2, 13, 11>
3. <15, 7, 4, 12>
4. <15, 7, 4, 7>
5. <15, 7, 10, 13>
6. <16, 14, 6, 12>
