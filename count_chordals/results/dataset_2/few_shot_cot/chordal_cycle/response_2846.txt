Response:
Let's go through the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Here are the cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <3, 15, 5, 9>
- Cycle 2: <3, 15, 12, 14>
- Cycle 3: <3, 15, 12, 8>
- Cycle 4: <15, 12, 14, 6>
- Cycle 5: <15, 12, 8, 9>
- Cycle 6: <12, 14, 6, 10>
- Cycle 7: <14, 6, 10, 7>
- Cycle 8: <6, 10, 7, 17>
- Cycle 9: <10, 7, 17, 19>
- Cycle 10: <7, 17, 19, 11>
- Cycle 11: <17, 19, 11, 5>
- Cycle 12: <19, 11, 5, 9>
- Cycle 13: <11, 5, 9, 3>
- Cycle 14: <5, 9, 3, 15>
- Cycle 15: <9, 3, 15, 0>
- Cycle 16: <3, 15, 0, 18>
- Cycle 17: <15, 0, 18, 13>
- Cycle 18: <0, 18, 13, 1>
- Cycle 19: <18, 13, 1, 14>
- Cycle 20: <13, 1, 14, 6>
- Cycle 21: <1, 14, 6, 10>
- Cycle 22: <14, 6, 10, 16>
- Cycle 23: <6, 10, 16, 7>
- Cycle 24: <10, 16, 7, 17>
- Cycle 25: <16, 7, 17, 4>
- Cycle 26: <7, 17, 4, 19>
- Cycle 27: <17, 4, 19, 11>
- Cycle 28: <4, 19, 11, 5>
- Cycle 29: <19, 11, 5, 15>
- Cycle 30: <11, 5, 15, 12>
- Cycle 31: <5, 15, 12, 8>
- Cycle 32: <15, 12, 8, 9>
- Cycle 33: <12, 8, 9, 2>
- Cycle 34: <8, 9, 2, 7>
- Cycle 35: <9, 2, 7, 10>
- Cycle 36: <2, 7, 10, 14>
- Cycle 37: <7, 10, 14, 1>
- Cycle 38: <10, 14, 1, 13>
- Cycle 39: <14, 1, 13, 18>
- Cycle 40: <1, 13, 18, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Here are the chordal 4-cycles:
<3, 15, 12, 8>, chord: (12, 8)
<12, 14, 6, 10>, chord: (14, 6)
<14, 6, 10, 7>, chord: (6, 10)
<7, 17, 4, 19>, chord: (17, 19)
<17, 19, 11, 5>, chord: (19, 11)
<19, 11, 5, 9>, chord: (11, 5)
<11, 5, 9, 3>, chord: (5, 9)
<119, 11, 5, 15>, chord: (11, 5)
<4, 19, 11, 5>, chord: (19, 11)
<18, 13,1, 14>, chord: (13, 1)
<13, 1, 14, 6>, chord: (1, 14)
<1, 14, 6, 10>, chord: (14, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [12].
