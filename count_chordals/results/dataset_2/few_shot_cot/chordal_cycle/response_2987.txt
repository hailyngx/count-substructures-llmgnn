Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <2, 5, 8, 4> with non-adjacent chord (2, 4).

To find the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph, we need to count the number of chordless 4-cycles. Based on the given information, there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle, so the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
