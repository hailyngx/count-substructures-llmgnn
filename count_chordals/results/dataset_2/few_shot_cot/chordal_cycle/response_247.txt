Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- <0, 1, 4, 9, 0>
- <1, 2, 4, 9, 1>
- <3, 5, 7, 4, 3>
- <4, 7, 3, 1, 4>
- <5, 9, 4, 7, 5>
- <6, 7, 4, 9, 6>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 1, 4, 9, 0> has chord (1, 9)
- <1, 2, 4, 9, 1> has chord (2, 4)
- <3, 5, 7, 4, 3> has chord (5, 4)
- <4, 7, 3, 1, 4> has chord (1, 3)
- <5, 9, 4, 7, 5> has chord (9, 7)
- <6, 7, 4, 9, 6> has chord (7, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles found, so the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
