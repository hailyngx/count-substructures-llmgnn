42. <3, 4, 8, 18>
43. <3, 11, 29, 5>
44. <3, 21, 18, 7>
45. <3, 21, 7, 8>
46. <10, 13, 29, 11>
47. <10, 13, 20, 17>
48. <10, 21, 7, 8>
49. <10, 21, 18, 4>
50. <11, 29, 5, 28>
51. <13, 20, 17, 2>
52. <15, 0, 25, 26>
53. <22, 16, 19, 14>
54. <22, 16, 11, 29>
55. <22, 5, 19, 16>
56. <23, 28, 5, 29>
57. <23, 6, 10, 21>
58. <23, 6, 9, 27>
59. <23, 9, 27, 20>
60. <24, 12, 22, 16>
61. <24, 12, 9, 27>
62. <25, 0, 15, 1>
63. <25, 0, 15, 1>
64. <27, 9, 23, 6>
65. <27, 9, 12, 24>
66. <29, 11, 3, 20>

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <8, 18, 21, 7> has a chord (18, 21), resulting in the chordal 4-cycle <<8, 18, 21, 7>, (18, 21)>.
- The cycle <21, 3, 4, 8> has a chord (3, 8), resulting in the chordal 4-cycle <<21, 3, 4, 8>, (3, 8)>.
- The cycle <21, 18, 2, 10> has a chord (18, 2), resulting in the chordal 4-cycle <<21, 18, 2, 10>, (18, 2)>.

Finally, the number of chordless cycles found is [63].
