Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:\
<0, 4, 10, 1>\
<0, 4, 13, 7>\
<0, 8, 12, 6>\
<1, 6, 13, 7>\
<2, 14, 11, 4>\
<2, 7, 3, 9>\
<2, 14, 3, 9>\
<3, 13, 5, 4>\
<3, 14, 11, 4>\
<3, 8, 12, 6>\
<4, 0, 8, 12>\
<4, 0, 6, 12>\
<4, 11, 14, 8>\
<5, 13, 7, 1>\
<6, 0, 4, 5>\
<6, 1, 14, 11>\
<7, 1, 10, 9>\
<7, 2, 14, 11>\
<8, 0, 6, 1>\
<8, 12, 6, 1>\
<8, 14, 11, 4>\
<9, 10, 1, 7>\
<9, 3, 13, 6>\
<9, 3, 7, 2>\
<10, 1, 14, 11>\
<10, 4, 5, 13>\
<11, 4, 5, 13>\
<12, 6, 1, 10>\
<12, 6, 13, 3>\
<12, 8, 0, 4>\
<13, 6, 12, 8>\
<13, 7, 1, 10>\
<13, 7, 2, 14>\
<14, 3, 8, 0>\
<14, 3, 9, 10>\

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:\
<0, 4, 10, 1> has chord (4, 10)\
<0, 8, 12, 6> has chord (8, 6)\
<1, 6, 13, 7> has chord (6, 7)\
<2, 7, 3, 9> has chord (7, 9)\
<3, 14, 11, 4> has chord (14, 11)\
<4, 0, 8, 12> has chord (0, 8)\
<6, 0, 4, 5> has chord (0, 4)\
<6, 1, 14, 11> has chord (1, 11)\
<8, 14, 11, 4> has chord (14, 11)\
<9, 3, 13, 6> has chord (3, 6)\
<10, 1, 14, 11> has chord (1, 14)\
<13, 7, 2, 14> has chord (7, 14)\

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:\
[1]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <2, 14, 3, 9>.
