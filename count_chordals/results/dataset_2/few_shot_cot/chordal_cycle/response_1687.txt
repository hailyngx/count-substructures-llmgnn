Step 2: Checking for chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 4, 2, 10> has exactly one chord (0, 7).
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 10, 2, 4> has exactly one chord (0, 7).
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 4, 2, 10> has exactly one chord (1, 7).
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 7, 10, 0> has exactly one chord (1, 4).
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 7, 10, 2> has exactly one chord (1, 4).
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 4, 0, 7> has exactly one chord (2, 1).
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 4, 0, 9> has exactly one chord (2, 1).
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 4, 2, 10> has exactly one chord (3, 14).
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, 1, 4, 0> has exactly one chord (7, 12).
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, 10, 13, 5> has exactly one chord (7, 1).
- Chordal 4-cycle <11, 13, 5, 14> has exactly one chord (11, 9).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the answer is [9].
