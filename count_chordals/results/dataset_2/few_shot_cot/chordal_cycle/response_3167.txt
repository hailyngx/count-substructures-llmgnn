Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
<0, 9, 5, 7> - chordless
<0, 9, 5, 2> - chordless
<0, 9, 5, 8> - chordless
<0, 3, 2, 5> - chordless
<1, 6, 9, 5> - chordless
<1, 6, 8, 5> - chordless
<2, 9, 5, 8> - chordless
<2, 9, 5, 7> - chordless
<2, 0, 7, 5> - chordless
<3, 7, 0, 9> - chordless
<4, 5, 9, 6> - chordless
<4, 6, 8, 5> - chordless
<4, 8, 2, 5> - chordless
<7, 5, 8, 6> - chordless

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0, 9, 5, 7> - has a chord (9, 5) 
<0, 9, 5, 2> - has a chord (9, 5)
<0, 9, 5, 8> - has a chord (9, 5)
<0, 3, 2, 5> - has a chord (3, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
