Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 14, 4, 3, 2, 13>
2. <0, 14, 13, 19, 18, 16>
3. <0, 1, 16, 18, 10, 5>
4. <0, 1, 16, 6, 2, 13>
5. <0, 1, 16, 18, 19, 13>
6. <0, 18, 16, 6, 15, 11>
7. <0, 18, 19, 13, 2, 3>
8. <0, 18, 19, 13, 3, 4>
9. <1, 16, 18, 19, 13, 0>
10. <1, 0, 14, 4, 3, 2>
11. <2, 3, 4, 14, 13, 0>
12. <2, 6, 15, 11, 8, 7>
13. <2, 6, 16, 18, 19, 13>
14. <2, 6, 16, 1, 0, 13>
15. <3, 13, 14, 4, 0, 1>
16. <6, 2, 13, 19, 18, 16>
17. <6, 16, 18, 10, 5, 7>
18. <6, 16, 1, 0, 14, 4>
19. <6, 15, 11, 8, 7, 17>
20. <15, 11, 8, 7, 17, 2>
21. <15, 6, 16, 1, 0, 13>

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 1, 16, (6, 2), 13>
<0, 18, 16, (6, 15), 11>
<0, 18, (19, 13), 2, 3>
<1, 16, 18, (19, 13), 0>
<2, (6, 15), 11, 8, 7>
<2, 6, 16, (1, 0), 13>
