Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <6, 9, (6, 25), 5>.

Following the steps provided earlier: 
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 
- (6, 8, 4, 15) 
- (6, 25, 5, 29) 
- (6, 25, 5, 19) 
- (6, 25, 15, 25) 
- (9, 6, 8, 4)
- (10, 19, 5, 17)
- (10, 19, 5, 20)
- (10, 19, 17, 23)
- (10, 12, 11, 26)
- (17, 5, 19, 10)
- (17, 19, 10, 12)
- (17, 19, 5, 20)
- (10, 12, 22, 7)
- (5, 25, 15, 4)
- (5, 19, 10, 12)
- (5, 19, 17, 23)
- (5, 29, 0, 4)
- (19, 10, 12, 11)
- (15, 25, 5, 29)
- (15, 25, 6, 28)
- (12, 22, 7, 3)
- (12, 11, 26, 14)
- (13, 18, 8, 4)
- (13, 18, 23, 17)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle). 
The cycle (6, 25, 5, 29) has the chord (6, 25).
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found. Therefore, the final count is [1].
