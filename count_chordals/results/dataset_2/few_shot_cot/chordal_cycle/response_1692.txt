Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <0, 4, 16, 17>
        - <0, 10, 5, 3>
        - <1, 16, 4, 8>
        - <2, 10, 6, 9>
        - <2, 10, 5, 3>
        - <3, 15, 7, 8>
        - <5, 10, 6, 9>
        - <7, 8, 4, 16>
        - <7, 8, 13, 9>
        - <11, 1, 5, 14>
        - <12, 19, 0, 10>
        - <13, 9, 17, 16>
        - <14, 19, 7, 8>
        - <15, 3, 9, 17>
        - <19, 14, 5, 3>
        - <19, 0, 10, 6>

    Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
        - Chord <16, 17> in <0, 4, 16, 17>
        - Chord <10, 5> in <0, 10, 5, 3>
        - Chord <8, 4> in <1, 16, 4, 8>
        - Chord <6, 9> in <2, 10, 6, 9>
        - Chord <10, 5> in <2, 10, 5, 3>
        - Chord <15, 7> in <3, 15, 7, 8>
        - Chord <10, 6> in <5, 10, 6, 9>
        - Chord <13, 9> in <7, 8, 13, 9>
        - Chord <11, 14> in <11, 1, 5, 14>
        - Chord <0, 10> in <12, 19, 0, 10>
        - Chord <17, 16> in <13, 9, 17, 16>
        - Chord <14, 8> in <14, 19, 7, 8>
        - Chord <9, 17> in <15, 3, 9, 17>
        - Chord <0, 10> in <19, 14, 5, 3>
        - Chord <19, 7> in <19, 0, 10, 6>

    Step 3: Counting the number of chordal cycles found:
        Total number of unique chordal 4-cycles = [15]
