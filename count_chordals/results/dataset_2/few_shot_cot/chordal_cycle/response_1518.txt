Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
    - Cycle 1: <6, 9, 4, 7>
    - Cycle 2: <6, 1, 4, 5>
    - Cycle 3: <6, 2, 4, 7>
    - Cycle 4: <9, 4, 7, 5>
    - Cycle 5: <9, 4, 1, 6>
    - Cycle 6: <9, 7, 0, 4>
    - Cycle 7: <4, 1, 8, 5>
    - Cycle 8: <4, 1, 5, 7>
    - Cycle 9: <4, 2, 7, 5>
    - Cycle 10: <7, 0, 4, 5>
    - Cycle 11: <7, 2, 4, 9>
    - Cycle 12: <7, 5, 8, 1>
    - Cycle 13: <1, 6, 9, 4>
    - Cycle 14: <1, 8, 5, 4>
    - Cycle 15: <2, 6, 9, 4>
    - Cycle 16: <2, 4, 7, 5>
    - Cycle 17: <2, 3, 8, 1>
    - Cycle 18: <3, 8, 5, 4>
    - Cycle 19: <5, 1, 4, 9>

Step 2:
- Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6, 9, 4, 7, (6, 7)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, 1, 4, 5, (1, 4)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, 2, 4, 7, (2, 7)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, 4, 7, 5, (4, 5)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 5: <9, 4, 1, 6, (1, 6)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, 7, 0, 4, (7, 0)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, 1, 8, 5, (1, 8)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, 1, 5, 7, (1, 7)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, 2, 7, 5, (2, 5)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 10: <7, 0, 4, 5, (0, 5)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 11: <7, 2, 4, 9, (2, 9)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 12: <7, 5, 8, 1, (5, 8)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 13: <1, 6, 9, 4, (9, 6)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 14: <1, 8, 5, 4, (8, 4)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 15: <2, 6, 9, 4, (6, 9)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 16: <2, 4, 7, 5, (4, 5)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 17: <2, 3, 8, 1, (3, 1)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 18: <3, 8, 5, 4, (8, 4)>
    - Unique Chordal 4-cycle 19: <5, 1, 4, 9, (1, 9)>

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]
