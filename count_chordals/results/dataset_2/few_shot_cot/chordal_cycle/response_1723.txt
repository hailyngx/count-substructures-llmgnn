Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 9) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 9) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, 6, 1, 9, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 2, 8, 1> with chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 6, 2, 8> with chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 2, 1, 4> with chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 2, 7, 9> with chord (2, 9)
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 4, 3, 5> with chord (4, 5)
- Cycle 6: <0, 1, 2, 9, 3> with chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 7: <0, 1, 2, 7, 9> with chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 6, 0, 1> with chord (0, 6)
- Cycle 9: <2, 5, 3, 9, 1> with chord (3, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 2 has one chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 3 has one chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 4 has one chord (2, 9)
- Cycle 5 has one chord (4, 5)
- Cycle 6 has one chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 7 has one chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 8 has one chord (0, 6)
- Cycle 9 has one chord (3, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
As all cycles listed have exactly one chord, there are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
