Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 7) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 4) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 14) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 7) (1, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 2) (3, 5) (3, 12) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (12, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 3)

Node 3 is connected to node 5, 12, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 13, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 12, 1, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 13, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, 2, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 10, 14, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 13, 0, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 8, 12, and node 4
Node 14 is connected to node 10, 11, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
Some cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle <5, 1, 4, 3>
- Cycle <5, 12, 13, 9>
- Cycle <0, 10, 14, 11>
- Cycle <1, 6, 4, 3>
- Cycle <5, 7, 2, 10>
- Cycle <2, 11, 8, 7>
- Cycle <0, 6, 4, 13>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes):
- Only cycle <5, 12, 13, 9> has exactly one chord, which is edge (13, 9)

Step 3:
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <5, 12, 13, 9>
