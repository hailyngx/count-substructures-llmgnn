Response:
Let's follow the steps to find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 10, 6>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 12, 7>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 14, 5>
- Cycle 4: <1, 4, 11, 7>
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 12, 6>
- Cycle 6: <1, 12, 13, 5>
- Cycle 7: <2, 1, 4, 3>
- Cycle 8: <2, 1, 9, 10>
- Cycle 9: <3, 4, 11, 14>
- Cycle 10: <3, 4, 1, 2>
- Cycle 11: <3, 8, 2, 6>
- Cycle 12: <5, 7, 11, 13>
- Cycle 13: <5, 13, 9, 10>
- Cycle 14: <6, 10, 9, 0>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 9, 10, 6> has a chord 9-10.
- <0, 6, 12, 7> has a chord 6-12.
- <0, 6, 14, 5> has a chord 6-14.
- <1, 4, 11, 7> has no chord.
- <1, 7, 12, 6> has a chord 7-12.
- <1, 12, 13, 5> has no chord.
- <2, 1, 4, 3> has no chord.
- <2, 1, 9, 10> has no chord.
- <3, 4, 11, 14> has no chord.
- <3, 4, 1, 2> has a chord 4-1.
- <3, 8, 2, 6> has no chord.
- <5, 7, 11, 13> has no chord.
- <5, 13, 9, 10> has no chord.
- <6, 10, 9, 0> has no chord.

Step 3: Counting the chordless cycles:
- There are 5 chordless 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [5].
