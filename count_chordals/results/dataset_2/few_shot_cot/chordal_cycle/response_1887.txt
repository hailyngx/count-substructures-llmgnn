Response:
Step 1: 
   - Consider all cycles of length 4: 
        - Cycle 1: <5, 4, 1, 7, 5>
        - Cycle 2: <5, 4, 2, 6, 5>
        - Cycle 3: <5, 7, 3, 2, 5>  
        - Cycle 4: <9, 6, 2, 3, 9>  
        - Cycle 5: <9, 7, 1, 4, 9>  
        - Cycle 6: <6, 5, 4, 8, 6>   
        - Cycle 7: <6, 5, 7, 9, 6>  
        - Cycle 8: <6, 9, 2, 4, 6>  
        - Cycle 9: <7, 5, 9, 1, 7>  
        - Cycle 10: <7, 9, 2, 3, 7>  
        - Cycle 11: <4, 5, 7, 1, 4>  
        - Cycle 12: <4, 6, 2, 9, 4>  

Step 2: 
   - Checking each cycle for exactly one chord: 
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (4, 2), 6, 5>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <9, (2, 3), 6, 9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <9, (7, 1), 4, 9>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <6, (5, 9), 2, 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6, (5, 7), 9, 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (2, 4), 9, 6>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (5, 9), 1, 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 8: <7, (2, 3), 9, 7>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, (5, 7), 1, 4>
        - Chordal 4-cycle 10: <4, (2, 9), 6, 4>

Step 3: 
   - Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
         - There are [0] chordless 4-cycles in this graph.
