Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (0, 9, 4, 5, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 7, 8, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 9, 8, 7, 2)
- Cycle 4: (3, 6, 7, 3)
- Cycle 5: (4, 9, 8, 4)
- Cycle 6: (5, 6, 7, 5)

Step 2:
Checking for exacty one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (4, 5), 0>
- Cycle 2: <2, (6, 8), 1>
- Cycle 3: <3, (7, 8), 2>
- Cycle 4: <4, (6, 7), 3>
- Cycle 5: <5, (4, 8), 4>
- Cycle 6: <6, (5, 7), 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (4, 5), 0>
<2, (6, 8), 1>
<3, (7, 8), 2>
<4, (6, 7), 3>
<5, (4, 8), 4>
<6, (5, 7), 6>
