Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:  
1. <0, 1, 5, 14>  
2. <0, 6, 2, 5>  
3. <0, 6, 8, 13>  
4. <2, 3, 8, 13>  
5. <2, 5, 14, 6>  
6. <2, 11, 1, 5>  
7. <3, 8, 13, 14>  
8. <4, 6, 2, 5>  
9. <4, 6, 8, 13>  
10. <4, 7, 0, 1>  
11. <4, 9, 3, 8>  
12. <5, 13, 7, 4>  
13. <5, 13, 8, 2>  
14. <5, 14, 6, 4>  
15. <6, 4, 9, 3>  
16. <7, 13, 8, 2>  
17. <8, 6, 4, 7>  
18. <8, 13, 5, 2>  
19. <9, 4, 7, 0>  
20. <10, 8, 3, 9>  
21. <11, 1, 5, 2>  
22. <11, 2, 5, 13>  
23. <11, 12, 3, 9>  
24. <12, 0, 6, 4>  
25. <12, 3, 9, 4>  

Step 2:  
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:  
1. <0, 1, 5, 14>, chord: (1, 14)  
2. <0, 6, 2, 5>, chord: (6, 5)  
3. <2, 3, 8, 13>, chord: (3, 8)  
4. <2, 5, 14, 6>, chord: (5, 6)  
5. <4, 7, 0, 1>, chord: (7, 1)  
6. <4, 6, 8, 13>, chord: (6, 8)  
7. <5, 14, 6, 4>, chord: (14, 4)  
8. <8, 13, 5, 2>, chord: (13, 5)  
9. <9, 4, 7, 0>, chord: (4, 7)  
10. <10, 8, 3, 9>, chord: (8, 9)  

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we find that there are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles. So, the final count is [10].
