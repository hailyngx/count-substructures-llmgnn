Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <1, (10, 5), 6>.

Here's the explanation:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (4, 8, 3, 12)
- Cycle 2: (4, 8, 10, 6)
- Cycle 3: (4, 9, 11, 5)
- Cycle 4: (4, 16, 7, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 11, 18, 14)
- Cycle 6: (5, 6, 1, 16)
- Cycle 7: (8, 4, 5, 6)
- Cycle 8: (9, 4, 16, 7)
- Cycle 9: (10, 8, 4, 5)
- Cycle 10: (10, 8, 3, 9)
- Cycle 11: (10, 19, 2, 18)
- Cycle 12: (11, 9, 3, 8)
- Cycle 13: (11, 15, 10, 6)
- Cycle 14: (13, 0, 12, 3)
- Cycle 15: (15, 13, 0, 19)
- Cycle 16: (18, 11, 5, 6)
- Cycle 17: (19, 10, 8, 3)

Step 2: Checking for chords:
- Cycle 6: (5, 6, 1, 16) has only one chord (10, 5).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1].
