Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 5>  
- Cycle 2: <3, 4, 1, 5>  
- Cycle 3: <3, 4, 1, 9>  
- Cycle 4: <3, 4, 0, 13>  
- Cycle 5: <5, 1, 4, 0>  
- Cycle 6: <5, 1, 9, 3>  
- Cycle 7: <5, 14, 19, 7>  
- Cycle 8: <5, 14, 19, 15>  
- Cycle 9: <5, 19, 14, 16>  
- Cycle 10: <5, 19, 7, 2>  
- Cycle 11: <15, 16, 11, 0>  
- Cycle 12: <15, 16, 5, 1>  
- Cycle 13: <15, 19, 14, 5>  
- Cycle 14: <15, 19, 7, 2>  
- Cycle 15: <16, 11, 0, 4>  
- Cycle 16: <16, 11, 0, 13>  
- Cycle 17: <16, 15, 5, 1>  
- Cycle 18: <16, 15, 19, 14>  
- Cycle 19: <16, 15, 19, 7>  
- Cycle 20: <17, 10, 12, 11>  
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:  
- <0, 4, 1, 5> has a chord (1, 5)  
- <3, 4, 1, 5> does not have a chord  
- <3, 4, 1, 9> does not have a chord  
- <3, 4, 0, 13> does not have a chord  
- <5, 1, 4, 0> does not have a chord  
- <5, 1, 9, 3> does not have a chord  
- <5, 14, 19, 7> does not have a chord  
- <5, 14, 19, 15> does not have a chord  
- <5, 19, 14, 16> does not have a chord  
- <5, 19, 7, 2> does not have a chord  
- <15, 16, 11, 0> does not have a chord  
- <15, 16, 5, 1> does not have a chord  
- <15, 19, 14, 5> does not have a chord  
- <15, 19, 7, 2> does not have a chord  
- <16, 11, 0, 4> does not have a chord  
- <16, 11, 0, 13> does not have a chord  
- <16, 15, 5, 1> does not have a chord  
- <16, 15, 19, 14> does not have a chord  
- <16, 15, 19, 7> does not have a chord  
- <17, 10, 12, 11> does not have a chord  
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:  
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found.  
Therefore, the result is [1].  
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 4, 1, 5>.
