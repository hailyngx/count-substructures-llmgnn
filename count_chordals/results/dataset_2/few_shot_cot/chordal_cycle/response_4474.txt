Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is <5, 9, 17, 13>. 

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-17-13-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-15-18-5
- Cycle 3: 9-15-18-17-9
- Cycle 4: 15-18-12-6-15
- Cycle 5: 18-12-19-12-18
- Cycle 6: 12-19-12-16-12

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- In Cycle 1: 5-9-13-17-5, chord 9-13 is present
- In Cycle 2: 5-9-15-18-5, no chord present
- In Cycle 3: 9-15-18-17-9, no chord present
- In Cycle 4: 15-18-12-6-15, no chord present
- In Cycle 5: 18-12-19-12-18, no chord present
- In Cycle 6: 12-19-12-16-12, no chord present

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
Since there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
