Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, 9, 0, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the given graph, but we will focus on finding the chordal 4-cycles:
- Cycle 1: (5, 6, 3, 4)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 4, 6)
- Cycle 3: (5, 0, 9, 7)
- Cycle 4: (6, 3, 7, 9)
- Cycle 5: (6, 4, 1, 5)
- Cycle 6: (6, 5, 8, 1)
- Cycle 7: (7, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 8: (7, 9, 2, 5)
- Cycle 9: (9, 2, 5, 1)
- Cycle 10: (9, 1, 0, 5)

Step 2: 
We will now check each of the identified cycles for the presence of exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has the chord <1, 4>.
- Cycle 6 has the chord <5, 1>.
- Cycle 7 has the chord <3, 6>.
- Cycle 8 has the chord <5, 7>.
- Cycle 9 has no chord.
- Cycle 10 has no chord.

Step 3:
The total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is given by the number of cycles with exactly one chord, which is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<6, 5, 1, 4> with chord <1, 4>
<6, 5, 8, 1> with chord <5, 1>
<7, 3, 6, 5> with chord <3, 6>
<7, 9, 2, 5> with chord <5, 7>
