Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
    - <0, 1, 5, 4, 0>
    - <0, 1, 5, 3, 7, 0>
    - <0, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 0>
    - <0, 2, 4, 5, 9, 3, 7, 0>
    - <1, 5, 4, 9, 3, 1>
    - <1, 5, 3, 9, 4, 6, 5>
    - <2, 4, 5, 9, 3, 2>
    - <3, 5, 4, 6, 5>
    - <3, 5, 9, 4, 6, 5>
    - <4, 5, 9, 3, 4>

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - Chordal 4-cycle <0, 1, 5, 4, 0> has chord (1, 4).
    - Chordal 4-cycle <0, 1, 5, 3, 7, 0> has chord (1, 3).
    - Chordal 4-cycle <0, 2, 4, 5, 3, 7, 0> has chord (4, 7).
    - Chordal 4-cycle <0, 2, 4, 5, 9, 3, 7, 0> has chord (2, 9).
    - Chordal 4-cycle <1, 5, 4, 9, 3, 1> has chord (4, 9).
    - Chordal 4-cycle <1, 5, 3, 9, 4, 6, 5> has chord (3, 6).
    - Chordal 4-cycle <2, 4, 5, 9, 3, 2> has chord (4, 9).
    - Chordal 4-cycle <3, 5, 4, 6, 5> has chord (4, 6).
    - Chordal 4-cycle <3, 5, 9, 4, 6, 5> has chord (9, 6).
    - Chordal 4-cycle <4, 5, 9, 3, 4> has chord (5, 3).

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have 10 chordal 4-cycles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [10].
