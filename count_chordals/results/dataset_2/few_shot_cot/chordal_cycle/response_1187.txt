Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, but we are interested in cycles of length 4 or more:
1. Cycle 1: <1, 5, 9, 4, 1>
2. Cycle 2: <1, 5, 8, 3, 1>
3. Cycle 3: <3, 5, 9, 4, 3>
4. Cycle 4: <4, 9, 5, 8, 4>
5. Cycle 5: <5, 6, 1, 3, 5>
6. Cycle 6: <5, 6, 4, 7, 5>
7. Cycle 7: <5, 7, 2, 1, 5>
8. Cycle 8: <8, 5, 9, 4, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the cycles listed above, only Cycle 1: <1, 5, 9, 4, 1> has exactly one chord which is (1, 9). The other cycles either have multiple chords or no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

As we have found one unique chordal 4-cycle <1, 5, 9, 4> with exactly one chord (1, 9), the final count is [1].
