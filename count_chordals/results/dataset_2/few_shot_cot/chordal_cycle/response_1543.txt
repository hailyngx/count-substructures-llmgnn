- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 14, 5>
- Cycle 3: <0, 15, 17, 6>
- Cycle 4: <0, 15, 17, 9>
- Cycle 5: <0, 15, 17, 18>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 2, 19>
- Cycle 7: <1, 5, 6, 17>
- Cycle 8: <1, 5, 14, 7>
- Cycle 9: <1, 13, 18, 17>
- Cycle 10: <1, 13, 10, 8>
- Cycle 11: <2, 3, 5, 6>
- Cycle 12: <3, 2, 19, 2>
- Cycle 13: <3, 5, 14, 7>
- Cycle 14: <3, 12, 16, 7>
