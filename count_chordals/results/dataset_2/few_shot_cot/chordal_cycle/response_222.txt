Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2: 
- There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3:
- There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
