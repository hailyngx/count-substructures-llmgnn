Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 9) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 0, 3, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 8, 5, 2) with edges (4, 8), (8, 5), (5, 2)
- Cycle 2: (4, 8, 3, 9) with edges (4, 8), (8, 3), (3, 9)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 1, 7) with edges (4, 8), (8, 1), (1, 7)
- Cycle 4: (4, 8, 5, 4) with edges (4, 8), (8, 5), (5, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 8, 3, 4) with edges (4, 8), (8, 3), (3, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 9, 3, 8) with edges (4, 9), (9, 3), (3, 8)
- Cycle 7: (4, 9, 2, 5) with edges (4, 9), (9, 2), (2, 5)
- Cycle 8: (4, 9, 0, 6) with edges (4, 9), (9, 0), (0, 6)
- Cycle 9: (4, 0, 6, 1) with edges (4, 0), (0, 6), (6, 1)
- Cycle 10: (4, 0, 9, 3) with edges (4, 0), (0, 9), (9, 3)
- Cycle 11: (8, 5, 2, 1) with edges (8, 5), (5, 2), (2, 1)
- Cycle 12: (8, 1, 6, 2) with edges (8, 1), (1, 6), (6, 2)
- Cycle 13: (8, 1, 7, 8) with edges (8, 1), (1, 7), (7, 8)
- Cycle 14: (5, 2, 6, 1) with edges (5, 2), (2, 6), (6, 1)
- Cycle 15: (6, 1, 8, 4) with edges (6, 1), (1, 8), (8, 4)
- Cycle 16: (9, 3, 4, 8) with edges (9, 3), (3, 4), (4, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <4, 9, 2, 5> has one chord (4, 8), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
