Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (9, 26, 24, 0, 9)
- Cycle 2: (9, 26, 17, 2, 14, 4, 24, 0, 23, 9)
- Cycle 3: (15, 27, 0, 24, 4, 22, 5, 1, 19, 6, 23, 28, 11, 19, 8, 11, 28, 23, 0, 27, 15)
- Cycle 4: (15, 27, 3, 25, 20, 16, 6, 23, 0, 24, 26, 17, 2, 14, 4, 12, 13, 21, 7, 18, 29, 27)
- Cycle 5: (15, 27, 29, 18, 13, 21, 7, 18, 29, 22, 10, 16, 25, 3, 14, 2, 17, 26, 24, 0, 12, 4, 22)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <9, (9, 26), 26, 24, 0, 9>
- Cycle 2 <9, (9, 26), 17, 2, 14, 4, 24, 0, 23, 9>
- Cycle 3 <15, (15, 27), 0, 24, 4, 22, 5, 1, 19, 6, 23, 28, 11, 19, 8, 11, 28, 23, 0, 27>
- Cycle 4 <15, (15, 27), 3, 25, 20, 16, 6, 23, 0, 24, 26, 17, 2, 14, 4, 12, 13, 21, 7, 18, 29>
- Cycle 5 <15, (15, 27), 29, 18, 13, 21, 7, 18, 29, 22, 10, 16, 25, 3, 14, 2, 17, 26, 24, 0, 12, 4, 22>
