Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <5, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 3, 7, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 7, 9, 5>

Step 2:
Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- <5, 7, 4, 5> has chord (7, 4)
- <5, 3, 7, 5> has chord (3, 7)
- <5, 7, 9, 5> has chord (7, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycle: None
