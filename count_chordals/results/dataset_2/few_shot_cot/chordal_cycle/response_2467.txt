Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
1. <0, 4, 5, 6, 0>
2. <1, 2, 7, 1>
3. <2, 6, 7, 2>
4. <4, 5, 9, 4>
5. <5, 6, 9, 5>
6. <6, 7, 2, 6>
7. <7, 1, 9, 7>
8. <8, 0, 2, 8>
9. <9, 1, 8, 9>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are: 
1. <4, 5, 9, 4, (9, 4)>
2. <5, 6, 9, 5, (6, 9)>
3. <6, 7, 2, 6, (7, 2)>
4. <7, 1, 9, 7, (1, 9)>
5. <8, 0, 2, 8, (0, 2)>

Step 3:
As there are 5 chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [5].
