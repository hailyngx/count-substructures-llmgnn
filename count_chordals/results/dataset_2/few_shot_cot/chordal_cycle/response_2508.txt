Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 1, 9, 4, 0>
- <0, 1, 6, 2, 0>
- <0, 1, 10, 13, 8, 0>
- <0, 4, 12, 9, 1, 0>
- <3, 1, 6, 2, 3>
- <3, 1, 9, 12, 3>
- <3, 1, 10, 13, 3>
- <3, 7, 9, 4, 3>
- <3, 12, 4, 11, 3>
- <4, 0, 8, 13, 4>
- <6, 1, 9, 12, 6>
- <7, 3, 12, 11, 7>
- <8, 0, 10, 13, 8>
- <8, 0, 11, 4, 8>
- <8, 0, 6, 2, 8>
- <8, 3, 12, 11, 8>
- <8, 10, 13, 14, 8>
- <8, 12, 4, 0, 8>
- <9, 1, 6, 2, 9>
- <9, 1, 10, 13, 9>
- <9, 3, 12, 4, 9>
- <10, 0, 4, 12, 10>
- <10, 1, 6, 2, 10>
- <12, 3, 1, 6, 12>
- <12, 4, 0, 8, 12>
- <12, 4, 11, 7, 12>
- <13, 5, 8, 0, 13>
- <13, 8, 14, 3, 13>
- <13, 8, 14, 2, 13>
- <14, 3, 7, 11, 14>
- <14, 3, 12, 8, 14>

Step 2:
From the list of cycles above, the unique chordal 4-cycle is: 
<3, (1, 12), 4, 11>)
<3, (1, 10), 13, 8)>
<8, (0, 10), 13, 4)>
<8, (0, 6), 2, 13)>
<8, (3, 11), 12, 4)>
<9, (1, 6), 2, 9)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [27].
