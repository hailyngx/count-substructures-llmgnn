Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <9, 5, 9>
- Cycle 2: <9, 6, 7, 9>
- Cycle 3: <9, 2, 4, 1, 9>
- Cycle 4: <9, 3, 2, 4, 1, 9>
- Cycle 5: <9, 1, 4, 7, 9>
- Cycle 6: <4, 8, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 7: <4, 1, 9, 5, 4>
- Cycle 8: <7, 6, 8, 4, 7>
- Cycle 9: <6, 9, 2, 8, 6>
- Cycle 10: <8, 1, 9, 3, 8>
- Cycle 11: <8, 2, 3, 9, 8>
- Cycle 12: <3, 8, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle 13: <0, 6, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle 14: <5, 9, 1, 0, 5>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <9, 5, 9> has 1 chord: (5, 9)
- <9, 6, 7, 9> has 1 chord: (6, 7)
- <9, 2, 4, 1, 9> has 1 chord: (2, 1)
- <9, 3, 2, 4, 1, 9> has 1 chord: (3, 4)
- <9, 1, 4, 7, 9> has 1 chord: (4, 7)
- <4, 8, 6, 7, 4> has 1 chord: (6, 8)
- <4, 1, 9, 5, 4> has 1 chord: (1, 5)
- <7, 6, 8, 4, 7> has 1 chord: (6, 8)
- <6, 9, 2, 8, 6> has 1 chord: (2, 8)
- <8, 1, 9, 3, 8> has 1 chord: (1, 3)
- <8, 2, 3, 9, 8> has 1 chord: (2, 9)
- <3, 8, 4, 7, 3> has 1 chord: (4, 7)
- <0, 6, 8, 4, 0> has 1 chord: (6, 8)
- <5, 9, 1, 0, 5> has 1 chord: (1, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
