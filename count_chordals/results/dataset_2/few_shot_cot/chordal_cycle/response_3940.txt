Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 2, 0>
2. Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 4, 0>
3. Cycle 3: <0, 5, 7, 4, 0>
4. Cycle 4: <0, 5, 1, 3, 0>
5. Cycle 5: <0, 5, 7, 8, 0>
6. Cycle 6: <0, 9, 4, 7, 0>
7. Cycle 7: <0, 9, 8, 6, 0>
8. Cycle 8: <0, 9, 8, 7, 0>
9. Cycle 9: <2, 1, 3, 0, 2>
10. Cycle 10: <3, 4, 9, 8, 3>
11. Cycle 11: <3, 4, 0, 5, 3>
12. Cycle 12: <4, 9, 8, 7, 4>
13. Cycle 13: <5, 9, 4, 7, 5>
14. Cycle 14: <5, 9, 8, 6, 5>
15. Cycle 15: <6, 5, 7, 8, 6>
16. Cycle 16: <7, 4, 9, 8, 7>
17. Cycle 17: <8, 9, 4, 7, 8>
18. Cycle 18: <9, 5, 7, 4, 9>

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, only Cycle 12: <4, 9, 8, 7, 4> has exactly one chord (edge 9-7).

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle in the given graph, so the final count is [1].
