Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 20, 8, 13>
- <0, 20, 26, 8>
- <0, 7, 3, 25>
- <3, 8, 20, 26>
- <3, 25, 27, 18>
- <3, 25, 27, 17>
- <3, 25, 28, 13>
- <4, 18, 27, 25>
- <5, 12, 7, 0>
- <9, 15, 2, 23>
- <9, 15, 17, 18>
- <9, 17, 18, 27>
- <10, 2, 23, 11>
- <11, 25, 27, 18>
- <11, 25, 27, 17>
- <11, 25, 28, 13>
- <15, 9, 17, 18>
- <17, 18, 27, 25>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 20, 8, 13> - Chord: (8, 20)
- <0, 20, 26, 8> - Chord: (20, 8)
- <3, 8, 20, 26> - Chord: (8, 20)
- <4, 18, 27, 25> - Chord: (18, 27)
- <9, 15, 17, 18> - Chord: (15, 17)
- <10, 2, 23, 11> - Chord: (2, 23)
- <11, 25, 27, 18> - Chord: (25, 27)
- <15, 9, 17, 18> - Chord: (9, 15)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [4]
