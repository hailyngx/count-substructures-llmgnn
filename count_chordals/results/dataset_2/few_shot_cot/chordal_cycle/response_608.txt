Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 14, 12, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 11, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, 10, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, 10, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 8, 2, 1, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 0, 14, 12, 1, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 14, 6, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<1, (11, 7), 5, 4>  
<1, (6, 14), 2, 9>  
<1, (5, 8), 3, 13>  
<1, (1, 10), 8, 5>  
<1, (11, 14), 12, 6>  
<1, (6, 7), 4, 3>  
<1, (2, 10), 8, 3>  
<1, (12, 11), 5, 13>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<1, (11, 7), 5, 4> has one chord: (7, 5)  
<1, (6, 14), 2, 9> has one chord: (14, 2)  
<1, (5, 8), 3, 13> has one chord: (8, 3)  
<1, (1, 10), 8, 5> has one chord: (10, 1)  
<1, (11, 14), 12, 6> has one chord: (11, 12)  
<1, (6, 7), 4, 3> has one chord: (6, 4)  
<1, (2, 10), 8, 3> has one chord: (10, 8)  
<1, (12, 11), 5, 13> has one chord: (12, 13)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].
