Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 3 - 7 - 4 - 8 - 9 - 6 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 5 - 9 - 8 - 4 - 7 - 3 - 6 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 4 - 3 - 6 - 1 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 9 - 6 - 3 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 5: 0 - 2 - 6 - 9 - 8 - 4 - 7 - 3 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 6: 0 - 2 - 7 - 4 - 8 - 9 - 6 - 3 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 7: 1 - 6 - 9 - 8 - 4 - 3 - 7 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 8: 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 9: 2 - 3 - 5 - 0 - 9 - 6 - 7 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 10: 2 - 7 - 4 - 8 - 9 - 6 - 3 - 2
- Cycle 11: 3 - 6 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 4 - 5 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 12: 3 - 7 - 4 - 8 - 9 - 6 - 2 - 1 - 3
- Cycle 13: 4 - 7 - 3 - 5 - 9 - 6 - 2 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 14: 5 - 9 - 6 - 2 - 7 - 4 - 3 - 5

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3 <0, 9, 8, (7, 4), 3, 6, 1, 2, 0>
- Cycle 7 <1, 6, 9, 8, 4, (3, 7), 2, 1>
- Cycle 10 <2, 7, 4, 8, 9, 6, (3, 5), 0, 2>

Step 3:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found within the graph, so the answer is [3].
