Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 7

Response:
Step 1:  
There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Thus, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [0].
