- <4, 13, 6, 10> with a chord (4, 13)
- <5, 15, 8, 11> with a chord (5, 8)
- <6, 10, 15, 18> with a chord (6, 15)
- <8, 19, 4, 0> with a chord (8, 4)
- <9, 2, 11, 8> with a chord (9, 11)
- <12, 13, 6, 10> with a chord (12, 6)
- <12, 14, 5, 17> with a chord (12, 5)
- <13, 4, 19, 16> with a chord (13, 19)

Step 3:
Counting the chordless cycles found, we have a total of [76].
