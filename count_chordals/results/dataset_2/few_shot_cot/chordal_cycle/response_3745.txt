Response:
Let's find all the chordal 4-cycles in this graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 24, 23, 12>
- Cycle 2: <0, 15, 13, 12, 23>
- Cycle 3: <0, 15, 1, 27, 20>
- Cycle 4: <0, 15, 1, 4, 2>
- Cycle 5: <0, 15, 12, 4, 2>
- Cycle 6: <0, 15, 12, 23, 24>
- Cycle 7: <0, 6, 3, 17, 18>
- Cycle 8: <0, 6, 21, 7, 14>
- Cycle 9: <0, 6, 21, 9, 19>
- Cycle 10: <0, 6, 21, 7, 29>
- Cycle 11: <1, 27, 20, 25, 9>
- Cycle 12: <1, 4, 2, 17, 18>
- Cycle 13: <1, 4, 12, 23, 24>
- Cycle 14: <1, 4, 12, 13, 15>
- Cycle 15: <1, 4, 26, 2, 17>
- Cycle 16: <4, 12, 13, 11, 22>
- Cycle 17: <7, 14, 23, 12, 13>
- Cycle 18: <7, 14, 10, 5, 27>
- Cycle 19: <7, 21, 9, 19, 22>
- Cycle 20: <7, 21, 9, 25, 20>
- Cycle 21: <7, 29, 19, 22, 11>
- Cycle 22: <8, 24, 23, 12, 13>
- Cycle 23: <8, 24, 15, 13, 12>
- Cycle 24: <8, 24, 15, 0, 6>
- Cycle 25: <13, 11, 22, 19, 9>
- Cycle 26: <15, 24, 23, 14, 10>
- Cycle 27: <15, 24, 23, 12, 13>
- Cycle 28: <16, 22, 11, 13, 15>
- Cycle 29: <16, 24, 15, 0, 6>
- Cycle 30: <16, 24, 8, 18, 17>
- Cycle 31: <19, 29, 7, 14, 10>
- Cycle 32: <19, 29, 7, 21, 9>
- Cycle 33: <20, 27, 5, 10, 14>
- Cycle 34: <22, 19, 29, 7, 14>
- Cycle 35: <22, 19, 29, 7, 21>
- Cycle 36: <23, 14, 10, 5, 27>
- Cycle 37: <24, 23, 12, 13, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 15, 12, 23> has chord (0, 12)
- <1, 27, 20, 25> has chord (1, 20)
- <0, 15, 12, 4> has chord (15, 4)
- <0, 6, 21, 7> has chord (6, 21)
- <4, 12, 13, 15> has chord (12, 15)
- <7, 14, 23, 12> has chord (14, 23)
- <8, 24, 23, 12> has chord (24, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- We found 31 chordless cycles.

Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [31].
