Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 23, (13, 6), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <8, 23, (13, 6), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <8, 29, (2, 5), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <10, 25, (4, 28), 24>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <18, 14, (22, 26), 10>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 50 cycles found, out of which 5 are chordal. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [45].
