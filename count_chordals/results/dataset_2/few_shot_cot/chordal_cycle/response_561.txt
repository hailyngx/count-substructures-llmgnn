Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <5, 11, 16, 10>. 

Following the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4:
- Cycle: <5, 11, 16, 10>
- Cycle: <5, 11, 14, 17>
- Cycle: <5, 11, 16, 7>
- Cycle: <5, 11, 14, 8>
- Cycle: <5, 19, 4, 9>
- Cycle: <5, 19, 4, 13>
- Cycle: <5, 12, 0, 16>
- Cycle: <5, 12, 18, 13>
- Cycle: <5, 12, 18, 2>
- Cycle: <5, 4, 9, 6>
- Cycle: <5, 4, 9, 7>
- Cycle: <5, 4, 13, 14>
- Cycle: <5, 4, 13, 18>
- Cycle: <5, 4, 19, 1>
- Cycle: <5, 4, 19, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle: <5, 11, 16, 10> has exactly one chord (edges 16-10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found, which is 1.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
