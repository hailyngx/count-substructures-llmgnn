Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: (3, 10, 17, 1, 4, 13)
- Cycle 2: (2, 8, 5, 6, 18, 7, 19)
- Cycle 3: (0, 16, 5, 8, 2, 19, 12)
- Cycle 4: (11, 19, 15, 14, 9, 13, 4, 1)
- Cycle 5: (12, 17, 1, 4, 13, 16, 0)
- Cycle 6: (5, 6, 18, 7, 19, 15, 14, 9)
- Cycle 7: (10, 17, 12, 16, 13, 11, 9, 14)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 11) <1, (1, 11), 4>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 7) <2, (5, 7), 18>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (8, 12) <3, (8, 12), 16>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (14, 1) <4, (14, 1), 9>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (4, 12) <5, (4, 12), 17>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (6, 15) <6, (6, 15), 18>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (9, 10) <7, (9, 10), 12>
  
Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
Since we found 7 unique chordal 4-cycles, the final number is [7].
