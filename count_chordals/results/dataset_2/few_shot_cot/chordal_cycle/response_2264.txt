Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1:
Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 1, 4, 5, 0>
- <1, 4, 7, 6, 1>
- <2, 3, 4, 7, 2>
- <3, 4, 8, 2, 3>
- <4, 5, 8, 1, 4>
- <5, 9, 7, 4, 5>
- <6, 7, 2, 3, 6>
- <7, 9, 5, 4, 7>
- <8, 1, 6, 3, 8>
- <9, 5, 0, 1, 9>


Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 4, 5, 0> has chord (1, 4)
- <1, 4, 7, 6, 1> has chord (4, 7)
- <2, 3, 4, 7, 2> has chord (3, 7)
- <3, 4, 8, 2, 3> has chord (4, 8)
- <4, 5, 8, 1, 4> has chord (5, 8)
- <5, 9, 7, 4, 5> has chord (7, 9)
- <6, 7, 2, 3, 6> has chord (7, 3)
- <7, 9, 5, 4, 7> has chord (5, 9)
- <8, 1, 6, 3, 8> has chord (1, 6)
- <9, 5, 0, 1, 9> has chord (0, 5)


Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [0].
