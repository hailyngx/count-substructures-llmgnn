Response:
Step 1:
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (3, 9, 13, 8)
- Cycle 2: (4, 3, 11, 14)
- Cycle 3: (2, 9, 13, 7)
- Cycle 4: (10, 6, 2, 12)
- Cycle 5: (5, 11, 3, 14)
- Cycle 6: (0, 8, 13, 0)
- Cycle 7: (1, 9, 2, 6)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (3, 9, 13, 8) has one chord (9, 8) 
- Cycle 2: (4, 3, 11, 14) has one chord (3, 14)
- Cycle 3: (2, 9, 13, 7) has one chord (9, 7)
- Cycle 4: (10, 6, 2, 12) has one chord (6, 2)
- Cycle 5: (5, 11, 3, 14) has one chord (11, 3)
- Cycle 6: (0, 8, 13, 0) has one chord (8, 13)
- Cycle 7: (1, 9, 2, 6) has one chord (9, 2)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph are:
<3, (9, 8)>
<4, (3, 14)>
<2, (9, 7)>
<10, (6, 2)>
<5, (11, 3)>
<0, (8, 13)>
<1, (9, 2)>
