Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 7, 3, 6>
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 6, 8>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 7, 5, 2>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 4, 7>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 2, 9>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle 7: <1, 9, 7, 6>
- Cycle 8: <1, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 2, 5, 7>
- Cycle 10: <3, 7, 6, 8>
- Cycle 11: <5, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 12: <5, 7, 6, 3>
- Cycle 13: <7, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 14: <0, 9, 7, 5>

Step 2:
Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 6, 8> - Chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 7, 5, 2> - Chord: (3, 5)
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 4, 7> - Chord: (5, 4)
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 2, 9> - Chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 7, 4> - Chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 8: <1, 9, 7, 3> - Chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 10: <3, 7, 6, 8> - Chord: (7, 6)
- Cycle 11: <5, 4, 8, 6> - Chord: (4, 8)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found:
Total = 14 cycles - 7 cycles with exactly one chord = 7 chordless cycles
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
