Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <1, 27, 2, 25, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 7, 2>
- Cycle 4: <3, 28, 24, 27, 2, 11, 29, 17, 5, 19, 18, 26, 8, 15, 13, 24, 28, 3>
- Cycle 5: <5, 17, 27, 24, 13, 15, 29, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle found:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, 28, 24, 27, 2, 11, 29, 17, 5, 19, 18, 26, 8, 15, 13, 24, 28, 3> (Chord: 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Final number: [1]
