Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 13, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 9, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 4, 7, 12, 2>
- Cycle 4: <3, 6, 7, 12, 3>
- Cycle 5: <4, 2, 12, 7, 4>
- Cycle 6: <5, 9, 6, 3, 5>
- Cycle 7: <6, 9, 8, 10, 6>
- Cycle 8: <7, 4, 1, 12, 7>
- Cycle 9: <8, 5, 0, 10, 8>
- Cycle 10: <11, 13, 3, 12, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycle 1: <0, (5, 13), 1, 0>
- Chordal cycle 2: <1, (9, 5), 8, 1>
- Chordal cycle 3: <2, (4, 7), 12, 2>
- Chordal cycle 4: <3, (6, 7), 12, 3>
- Chordal cycle 5: <4, (2, 12), 7, 4>
- Chordal cycle 6: <5, (9, 6), 3, 5>
- Chordal cycle 7: <6, (9, 8), 10, 6>
- Chordal cycle 8: <7, (4, 1), 12, 7>
- Chordal cycle 9: <8, (5, 0), 10, 8>
- Chordal cycle 10: <11, (13, 3), 12, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found, which is 10. 
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
