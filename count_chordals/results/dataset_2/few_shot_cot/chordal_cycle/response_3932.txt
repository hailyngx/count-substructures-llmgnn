Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 7, 5>, Chord: (9, 7)

- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, 0, 2, 9, 5>, Chord: (0, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 0, 8, 7, 5>, Chord: (0, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, 4, 7, 5, 9>, Chord: (4, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <9, 4, 6, 5, 9>, Chord: (4, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <9, 7, 4, 6, 9>, Chord: (7, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 24 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [24].
