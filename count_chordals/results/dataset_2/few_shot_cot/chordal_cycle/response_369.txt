- <1, 14, 9, 20> has a chord 14-9
- <2, 12, 25, 21> has a chord 12-21
- <3, 10, 8, 5> has a chord 10-8
- <3, 10, 18, 9> has a chord 10-18
- <4, 12, 25, 21> has a chord 12-21
- <5, 17, 28, 6> has a chord 17-6
- <5, 17, 27, 20> has a chord 17-27
- <6, 28, 17, 5> has a chord 28-5
- <6, 15, 24, 15> has a chord 15-24
- <8, 10, 18, 9> has a chord 10-18
