Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 6 - 9 - 3 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 6 - 7 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 6 - 5 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 2 - 8 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 5: 0 - 2 - 3 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 6: 0 - 3 - 7 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 7: 1 - 9 - 4 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 8: 1 - 9 - 4 - 3 - 1
- Cycle 9: 2 - 0 - 6 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 10: 2 - 0 - 3 - 9 - 2
- Cycle 11: 2 - 4 - 3 - 8 - 2
- Cycle 12: 3 - 9 - 1 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 13: 3 - 9 - 4 - 2 - 3
- Cycle 14: 4 - 9 - 3 - 2 - 4
- Cycle 15: 5 - 6 - 0 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 16: 5 - 8 - 7 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 17: 6 - 7 - 8 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 18: 7 - 6 - 0 - 3 - 7
- Cycle 19: 7 - 1 - 9 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 20: 8 - 5 - 6 - 0 - 8
- Cycle 21: 8 - 3 - 2 - 4 - 8

Step 2: Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- No chord present in Cycle 1
- No chord present in Cycle 2
- No chord present in Cycle 3
- No chord present in Cycle 4
- Chord present in Cycle 5: Chord - (0, 9)
- No chord present in Cycle 6
- No chord present in Cycle 7
- No chord present in Cycle 8
- No chord present in Cycle 9
- No chord present in Cycle 10
- No chord present in Cycle 11
- No chord present in Cycle 12
- No chord present in Cycle 13
- No chord present in Cycle 14
- No chord present in Cycle 15
- No chord present in Cycle 16
- No chord present in Cycle 17
- No chord present in Cycle 18
- No chord present in Cycle 19
- No chord present in Cycle 20
- No chord present in Cycle 21

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 14 chordless cycles found. Hence, the final count is [14].

Unique chordless 4-cycle: 
<0, 6, 9, 3>
<0, 6, 7, 1>
<0, 6, 5, 8>
<0, 2, 8, 5>
<1, 9, 4, 7>
<2, 4, 3, 8>
<3, 9, 1, 7>
<4, 9, 3, 2>
<5, 6, 0, 2>
<5, 8, 7, 6>
<6, 7, 8, 5>
<7, 6, 0, 3>
<8, 5, 6, 0>
<8, 3, 2, 4>
