Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 14, 7, 11, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 10
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 14, 11, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 11, 14, and node 12

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:

(1) Cycle: 5 - 6 - 9 - 11 - 5
(2) Cycle: 1 - 5 - 10 - 3 - 1
(3) Cycle: 6 - 9 - 12 - 6
(4) Cycle: 5 - 2 - 12 - 3 - 5
(5) Cycle: 0 - 4 - 7 - 6 - 0
(6) Cycle: 1 - 8 - 14 - 13 - 1
(7) Cycle: 1 - 3 - 12 - 6 - 1
(8) Cycle: 6 - 11 - 8 - 1 - 6
(9) Cycle: 2 - 5 - 10 - 3 - 2
(10) Cycle: 2 - 12 - 9 - 14 - 2
(11) Cycle: 13 - 1 - 11 - 8 - 13
(12) Cycle: 0 - 13 - 14 - 9 - 0
(13) Cycle: 4 - 10 - 7 - 6 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
 
<1, (11, 13), 8>
<2, (10, 3), 5>
<6, (9, 12), 6>
<9, (2, 14), 12>
<10, (7, 6), 4>
<11, (6, 1), 8>
<12, (9, 14), 6>
<13, (11, 8), 1>
<4, (7, 6), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [9].
