Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 6, 9, 4> has chord (6, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 6, 3, 1> has chord (3, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 6, 3, 5> has chord (6, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 6, 9, 7> has chord (6, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, 3, 6, 9> has chord (3, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, 3, 4, 8> has chord (3, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, 5, 3, 4> has chord (3, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, 5, 7, 6> has chord (5, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <2, 3, 6, 9> has chord (3, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <2, 3, 4, 8> has chord (3, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <3, 6, 9, 7> has chord (6, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <3, 6, 7, 5> has chord (6, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <4, 6, 9, 7> has chord (6, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <4, 6, 8, 1> has chord (6, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <5, 1, 7, 0> has chord (1, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <7, 6, 9, 4> has chord (6, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 16 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [16].
