Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 5, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 5, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 5, 3, 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 8, 0, 6, 5, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 8, 0, 6, 5, 3, 7, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 0, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 1, 4, 8, 0, 6, 5, 9, 7, 0, 2>
- Cycle 10: <3, 5, 9, 6, 0, 8, 4, 3>
- Cycle 11: <3, 4, 8, 0, 6, 5, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle 12: <5, 9, 6, 0, 8, 4, 3, 7, 5>

Step 2: Checking for chords:
- Cycle 1 has chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 2 has chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 3 has chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 4 does not have a chord
- Cycle 5 has chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 6 has chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 7 has chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 8 has chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 9 has chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 10 does not have a chord
- Cycle 11 does not have a chord
- Cycle 12 does not have a chord

Step 3: Counting chordal 4-cycles:
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 6, 5, 3, 0> (chord: (5, 3))
<0, 6, 5, 9, 6, 0> (chord: (5, 9))
<0, 6, 5, 7, 0> (chord: (5, 7))
<1, 4, 8, 0, 6, 5, 9, 7, 1> (chord: (5, 9))
<2, 1, 4, 8, 0, 6, 5, 9, 7, 0, 2> (chord: (8, 4))
<1, 4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 1> (chord: (5, 9))
<2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 0, 2> (chord: (5, 9))
