Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle <1, 8, 2, 4>
- Cycle <1, 12, 3, 1>
- Cycle <1, 8, 2, 16>
- Cycle <1, 8, 10, 19>
- Cycle <1, 8, 10, 5>
- Cycle <1, 3, 12, 6>
- Cycle <2, 8, 10, 19>
- Cycle <3, 12, 15, 4>
- Cycle <3, 12, 9, 16>
- Cycle <4, 15, 14, 13>
- Cycle <4, 2, 16, 9>
- Cycle <5, 7, 11, 18>
- Cycle <5, 7, 11, 5>
- Cycle <6, 13, 14, 15>
- Cycle <6, 12, 1, 8>
- Cycle <8, 1, 3, 12>
- Cycle <8, 2, 16, 9>
- Cycle <9, 16, 18, 17>
- Cycle <10, 2, 16, 18>
- Cycle <10, 2, 4, 15>
- Cycle <10, 5, 7, 11>
- Cycle <11, 18, 17, 13>
- Cycle <13, 14, 15, 4>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
<1, 8, 2, 4, (8, 10)>
<1, 12, 3, 1, (1, 8)>
<1, 8, 2, 16, (8, 10)>
<1, 8, 10, 19, (8, 10)>
<1, 3, 12, 6, (3, 12)>
<2, 8, 10, 19, (8, 10)>
<3, 12, 15, 4, (4, 15)>
<3, 12, 9, 16, (12, 9)>
<4, 15, 14, 13, (13, 14)>
<4, 2, 16, 9, (2, 16)>
<5, 7, 11, 18, (7, 11)>
<6, 13, 14, 15, (13, 14)>
<8, 1, 3, 12, (1, 8)>
<8, 2, 16, 9, (2, 16)>
<9, 16, 18, 17, (16, 18)>
<10, 2, 16, 18, (2, 16)>
<10, 2, 4, 15, (2, 4)>
<10, 5, 7, 11, (5, 7)>
<11, 18, 17, 13, (17, 13)>
<13, 14, 15, 4, (14, 15)>

Step 3:
There are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles found. 
So, the final count is [20].
