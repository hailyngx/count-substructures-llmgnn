Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: <3, 15, 17, 7>
        - Cycle 2: <3, 15, 17, 12>
        - Cycle 3: <3, 15, 17, 11>
        - Cycle 4: <3, 10, 6, 1>
        - Cycle 5: <15, 17, 12, 14>
        - Cycle 6: <15, 17, 12, 0>
        - Cycle 7: <6, 1, 13, 5>
        - Cycle 8: <6, 10, 3, 2>
        - Cycle 9: <6, 10, 8, 1>
        - Cycle 10: <6, 8, 10, 2>
        - Cycle 11: <6, 4, 19, 14>
        - Cycle 12: <6, 4, 19, 12>
        - Cycle 13: <6, 4, 16, 2>

        - Cycle 17: <5, 13, 11, 17>
        - Cycle 18: <5, 13, 1, 6>
        - Cycle 19: <13, 11, 17, 12>
        - Cycle 20: <13, 11, 17, 7>
        - Cycle 21: <13, 1, 6, 10>
        - Cycle 22: <0, 7, 13, 5>
        - Cycle 23: <0, 12, 14, 19>
        - Cycle 24: <7, 17, 12, 0>
        - Cycle 25: <7, 17, 12, 14>
        - Cycle 26: <7, 11, 17, 12>

        - Cycle 29: <10, 2, 16, 4>
        - Cycle 30: <11, 13, 1, 6>
        - Cycle 31: <16, 2, 3, 15>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Cycle 3 <3, 15, 17, 11> has a chord (15, 17)
        - Cycle 4 <3, 10, 6, 1> has a chord (10, 6)
        - Cycle 6 <15, 17, 12, 0> has a chord (17, 12)
        - Cycle 7 <6, 1, 13, 5> has a chord (1, 13)
        - Cycle 9 <6, 10, 8, 1> has a chord (10, 8)
        - Cycle 10 <6, 8, 10, 2> has a chord (8, 10)
        - Cycle 12 <6, 4, 19, 12> has a chord (4, 19)
        - Cycle 13 <6, 4, 16, 2> has a chord (4, 16)
        - Cycle 15 <9, 2, 16, 4> has a chord (2, 16)
        - Cycle 16 <5, 13, 11, 7> has a chord (13, 11)
        - Cycle 17 <5, 13, 11, 17> has a chord (13, 11)
        - Cycle 22 <0, 7, 13, 5> has a chord (7, 13)
        - Cycle 23 <0, 12, 14, 19> has a chord (12, 14)
        - Cycle 24 <7, 17, 12, 0> has a chord (17, 12)
        - Cycle 25 <7, 17, 12, 14> has a chord (17, 12)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
        There are 30 cycles in total, and 14 cycles have exactly one chord.
        Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles is: [30-14 = 16].
