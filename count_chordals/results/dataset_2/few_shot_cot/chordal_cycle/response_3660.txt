Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle with 4 nodes: <4, 7, 14, 16, 4>
        - Cycle with 4 nodes: <4, 9, 8, 1, 4>
        - Cycle with 5 nodes: <5, 13, 2, 6, 1, 5>
        - Cycle with 4 nodes: <7, 3, 11, 10, 7>
        - Cycle with 4 nodes: <7, 16, 14, 18, 7>
        - Cycle with 5 nodes: <8, 19, 15, 12, 17, 8>
        - Cycle with 4 nodes: <9, 16, 10, 11, 9>
        - Cycle with 4 nodes: <12, 4, 7, 16, 12>
        - Cycle with 4 nodes: <13, 5, 19, 15, 13>
        - Cycle with 4 nodes: <17, 3, 7, 16, 17>
        - Cycle with 4 nodes: <18, 5, 13, 17, 18>
        - Cycle with 4 nodes: <2, 10, 11, 0, 2>
        - Cycle with 4 nodes: <6, 1, 8, 9, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Chordless cycle: <4, 7, 14, 16, 4>
        - Chordless cycle: <4, 9, 8, 1, 4>
        - Chordless cycle: <7, 3, 11, 10, 7>
        - Chordless cycle: <8, 19, 15, 12, 17, 8>
        - {Chordal cycle: <12, (4, 17), 15, 12>}
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [4]

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
