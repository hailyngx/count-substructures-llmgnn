Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 17, 15, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 4, 13, 2, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 5, 14, 5, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 1, 3, 8, 19, 16, 6, 7, 12, 4, 2>
- Cycle 5: <2, 13, 4, 3, 9, 17, 0, 2>
- Cycle 6: <4, 3, 9, 19, 11, 7, 12, 4>
- Cycle 7: <4, 11, 7, 12, 16, 19, 9, 3, 4>
- Cycle 8: <6, 7, 11, 19, 16, 12, 18, 6>
- Cycle 9: <16, 12, 7, 11, 19, 8, 3, 1, 2, 10, 16>
- Cycle 10: <17, 9, 3, 1, 2, 13, 4, 0, 17>

Step 2: Identify and count chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <2, (1, 4), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (3, 16), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, (7, 12), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, (3, 16), 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <8, (3, 16), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, (3, 16), 19>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <15, (2, 13), 17>

Step 3: Count the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are [7] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
