Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Based on the given graph, we can identify the following cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 9, 6>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 4, 9>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 4, 7>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 5, 4>
- Cycle 6: <0, 9, 7, 4>
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 9, 7>
- Cycle 8: <1, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 9: <1, 7, 4, 9>
- Cycle 10: <2, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle 11: <3, 4, 7, 9>
- Cycle 12: <3, 4, 5, 9>
- Cycle 13: <7, 9, 4, 5>
- Cycle 14: <8, 4, 5, 9>
- Cycle 15: <8, 4, 7, 9>

Step 2:
Next, we need to check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 <0, 5, 4, 9> has a chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 3 <0, 5, 4, 7> has a chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 5 <0, 9, 5, 4> has a chord (5, 4)
- Cycle 6 <0, 9, 7, 4> has a chord (7, 4)
- Cycle 9 <1, 7, 4, 9> has a chord (7, 9)

Step 3:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph. Therefore, the answer is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 5, 4, 9> with the chord (5, 9)
- <0, 5, 4, 7> with the chord (4, 7)
- <0, 9, 5, 4> with the chord (5, 4)
- <0, 9, 7, 4> with the chord (7, 4)
- <1, 7, 4, 9> with the chord (7, 9)
