        - Cycle 47: <27, 9, 8, 15>
        - Cycle 48: <29, 28, 13, 25>
        - Cycle 49: <29, 3, 20, 17>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 5, 21, 7> (Chord: (5,7))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, 21, 7, 12> (Chord: (21,12))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, 5, 26, 16> (Chord: (5,16))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There are 46 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [46].
