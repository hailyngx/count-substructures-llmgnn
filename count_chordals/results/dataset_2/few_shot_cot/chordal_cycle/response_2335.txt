Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 10, 11, 9, 0>
2. <0, 1, 8, 14, 9, 0>
3. <0, 9, 5, 8, 14, 0>
4. <1, 10, 11, 9, 5, 1>
5. <2, 4, 11, 6, 13, 12, 3, 4>
6. <2, 4, 11, 10, 7, 2>
7. <2, 7, 10, 11, 6, 13, 12, 3, 2>
8. <4, 11, 6, 13, 12, 5, 9, 4>
9. <5, 6, 11, 9, 0, 13, 12, 5>
10. <5, 7, 10, 11, 9, 0, 13, 12, 5>
11. <5, 8, 14, 9, 0, 13, 12, 5>
12. <6, 11, 9, 0, 13, 12, 5, 6>
13. <7, 10, 11, 6, 13, 12, 5, 8, 7>
14. <8, 5, 9, 11, 10, 7, 2, 4, 8>
15. <9, 11, 6, 13, 0, 14, 8, 5, 9>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, 1, 10, 11, 9, 0> (Chord: (1, 10))
2. <0, 1, 8, 14, 9, 0> (Chord: (1, 8))
3. <0, 9, 5, 8, 14, 0> (Chord: (5, 14))
4. <1, 10, 11, 9, 5, 1> (Chord: (10, 5))
5. <2, 7, 10, 11, 6, 13, 12, 3, 2> (Chord: (7, 6))
6. <4, 11, 6, 13, 12, 5, 9, 4> (Chord: (6, 9))
7. <5, 6, 11, 9, 0, 13, 12, 5> (Chord: (6, 0))
8. <5, 7, 10, 11, 9, 0, 13, 12, 5> (Chord: (7, 0))
9. <6, 11, 9, 0, 13, 12, 5, 6> (Chord: (11, 5))
10. <9, 11, 6, 13, 0, 14, 8, 5, 9> (Chord: (11, 8))

Step 3:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
