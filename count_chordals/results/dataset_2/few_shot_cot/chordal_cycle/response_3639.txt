Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        <0, 9, 5, 10, 7>
        <0, 9, 5, 11, 8>
        <0, 9, 5, 4, 7>
        <0, 9, 5, 4, 14>
        <0, 4, 7, 6, 3>
        <2, 9, 5, 10, 7>
        <2, 9, 5, 11, 8>
        <2, 9, 5, 4, 7>
        <2, 9, 5, 4, 14>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        <0, 9, 5, 10, 7> (Chord: (0, 7))
        <0, 9, 5, 11, 8> (Chord: (9, 11))
        <0, 9, 5, 4, 7> (Chord: (4, 5))
        <0, 9, 5, 4, 14> (Chord: (4, 14))
        <2, 9, 5, 10, 7> (Chord: (9, 5))
        <2, 9, 5, 11, 8> (Chord: (9, 11))
        <2, 9, 5, 4, 7> (Chord: (9, 5))
        <2, 9, 5, 4, 14> (Chord: (9, 5))
        <3, 5, 9, 14, 7> (Chord: (9, 5))
        <3, 5, 9, 14, 4> (Chord: (9, 5))
        <3, 5, 4, 7, 6> (Chord: (4, 7))
        <3, 5, 4, 14, 7> (Chord: (4, 7))
        <4, 5, 11, 1, 8> (Chord: (5, 11))
        <4, 7, 6, 3, 12> (Chord: (6, 3))
        <5, 9, 2, 13, 11> (Chord: (9, 11))
        <5, 9, 14, 7, 4> (Chord: (9, 5))
        <5, 10, 7, 14, 3> (Chord: (10, 7))
        <6, 7, 0, 9, 5> (Chord: (0, 7))
        <6, 7, 10, 5, 9> (Chord: (7, 9))
        <7, 4, 14, 3, 12> (Chord: (4, 12))
        <8, 11, 1, 5, 9> (Chord: (5, 9))
        <10, 5, 11, 8, 0> (Chord: (5, 8))
        <11, 5, 10, 7, 14> (Chord: (5, 10))
        <12, 8, 0, 9, 5> (Chord: (8, 9))
        <12, 8, 11, 5, 10> (Chord: (8, 11))
        <12, 3, 6, 7, 4> (Chord: (3, 7))
        <14, 9, 5, 10, 7> (Chord: (9, 5))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
        There are [26] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
