Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-6-1-4-7-0
        - Cycle 2: 0-6-2-3-0
        - Cycle 3: 0-6-2-1-0

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord (1,4)
        - Cycle 2 has a chord (2,3)
        - Cycle 3 does not have a chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        Final count: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
        <0, 6, 2, 1>
