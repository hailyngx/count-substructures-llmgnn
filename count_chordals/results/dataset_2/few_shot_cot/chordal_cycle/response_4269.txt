Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (1, 5, 2, 8, 13, 9, 1) is a 6-cycle
- (4, 11, 3, 7, 3, 11, 4) is a 6-cycle
- (6, 0, 1, 11, 12, 10, 4, 8, 2, 13, 6) is a 10-cycle
- (9, 13, 8, 5, 2, 1, 9) is a 7-cycle
- (9, 3, 7, 3, 9) is a 5-cycle

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- The cycle (1, 5, 2, 8, 13, 9, 1) has a chord 2-9
- The cycle (4, 11, 3, 7, 3, 11, 4) has a chord 4-11

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 3 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, 5, 2, 8, 13, 9, 1>
<4, 11, 3, 7, 3, 11, 4>
<9, 13, 8, 5, 2, 1, 9>
