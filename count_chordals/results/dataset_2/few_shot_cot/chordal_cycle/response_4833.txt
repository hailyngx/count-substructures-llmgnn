Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. <0, 15, 3, 1, 0>
2. <0, 15, 7, 19, 0>
3. <0, 15, 8, 11, 1, 6, 5, 12, 0>
4. <1, 3, 15, 7, 17, 2, 1>
5. <1, 3, 15, 8, 11, 14, 4, 17, 2, 1>
6. <1, 3, 10, 4, 17, 2, 1>
7. <1, 6, 5, 12, 17, 4, 14, 11, 1>
8. <2, 17, 7, 19, 13, 14, 4, 0, 12, 2>
9. <3, 15, 7, 17, 4, 14, 13, 19, 0, 3>
10. <4, 17, 7, 15, 3, 10, 5, 12, 0, 4>
11. <8, 11, 14, 13, 19, 0, 12, 18, 3, 8>

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 15, 3, 1, 0> (Chord: 1-3)
2. <0, 15, 7, 19, 0> (Chord: 7-19)
3. <1, 3, 15, 7, 17, 2, 1> (Chord: 17-7)
4. <1, 6, 5, 12, 17, 4, 14, 11, 1> (Chord: 5-14)
5. <2, 17, 7, 19, 13, 14, 4, 0, 12, 2> (Chord: 2-19)
6. <3, 15, 7, 17, 4, 14, 13, 19, 0, 3> (Chord: 7-19)
7. <4, 17, 7, 15, 3, 10, 5, 12, 0, 4> (Chord: 3-10)
8. <8, 11, 14, 13, 19, 0, 12, 18, 3, 8> (Chord: 14-13)

Step 3: 
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
