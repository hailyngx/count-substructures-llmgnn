Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 7, 5, 1, 0>
- <0, 7, 5, 2, 3, 0>
- <1, 5, 2, 8, 9, 1>
- <1, 5, 7, 9, 1>
- <2, 5, 9, 8, 2>
- <3, 7, 5, 9, 8, 3>
- <4, 7, 5, 1, 4>
- <4, 7, 3, 8, 2, 5, 9, 6, 4>
- <5, 7, 9, 8, 3, 6, 5>
- <6, 9, 5, 7, 3, 8, 2, 6>
- <7, 5, 9, 8, 4, 1, 0, 7>
- <8, 9, 5, 7, 3, 6, 2, 8>
- <9, 5, 7, 0, 1, 9>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 5, 7, 9, 1> (chord: (7, 9))
- <2, 5, 9, 8, 2> (chord: (5, 9))
- <4, 7, 5, 1, 4> (chord: (7, 1))

Step 3:
There are [3] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
