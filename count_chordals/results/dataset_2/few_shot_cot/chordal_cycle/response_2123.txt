Response:
Step 1:  
List of cycles of length 4 or more:  
- <0, 4, 7, 10>  
- <0, 4, 6, 13>  
- <0, 4, 8, 1>  
- <0, 4, 8, 2>  
- <0, 7, 10, 5>  
- <0, 7, 3, 2>  
- <0, 3, 2, 8>  
- <1, 8, 2, 3>  
- <2, 8, 4, 6>  
- <2, 8, 4, 7>  
- <2, 8, 0, 3>  
- <3, 7, 0, 8>  
- <4, 8, 1, 9>  
- <5, 10, 7, 4>  
- <5, 10, 13, 6>  
- <5, 12, 14, 11>  
- <5, 12, 6, 4>  
- <6, 13, 12, 5>  
- <6, 13, 10, 7>  
- <6, 13, 10, 11>  
- <7, 10, 13, 12>  
- <7, 10, 5, 14>  
- <8, 2, 1, 9>  
- <10, 7, 4, 8>  
- <10, 7, 4, 0>  
- <10, 13, 6, 12>  
- <11, 14, 12, 6>  

Step 2:  
Checking for chords in the cycles:  
- <0, 4, 7, 10> has chord (4, 10)  
- <0, 4, 6, 13> has chord (4, 13)  
- <0, 4, 8, 1> has chord (4, 8)  
- <0, 4, 8, 2> has chord (4, 8)  
- <0, 7, 10, 5> has chord (7, 5)  
- <0, 7, 3, 2> has chord (7, 2)  
- <2, 8, 4, 6> has chord (8, 6)  
- <5, 10, 7, 4> has chord (10, 4)  
- <5, 10, 13, 6> has chord (10, 6)  
- <5, 12, 14, 11> has chord (12, 11)  

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have a total of [17] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.  
Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 4, 7, 10>
- <0, 4, 6, 13>
- <0, 4, 8, 1>
- <0, 4, 8, 2>
- <0, 7, 10, 5>
- <0, 7, 3, 2>
- <2, 8, 4, 6>
- <5, 10, 7, 4>
- <5, 10, 13, 6>
- <5, 12, 14, 11>
