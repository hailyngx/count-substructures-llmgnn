Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles with length 4 or more in the graph are: 
   - <9, 12, 3, 5> 
   - <15, 27, 10, 9> 
   - <2, 6, 10, 9> 
   - <7, 23, 18, 27> 
   - <4, 22, 10, 6> 
   - <13, 11, 21, 15> 
   - <14, 8, 19, 28> 
   - <17, 25, 14, 1> 
   - <16, 24, 21, 15> 
   - <20, 23, 18, 4> 
   - <10, 27, 5, 3> 
   - <14, 19, 8, 9> 
   - <21, 22, 16, 24>

Step 2: 
- The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
   - <15, (27, 10), 9>
   - <2, (6, 10), 9>
   - <21, (11, 15), 13>
   - <16, (21, 24), 22>

Step 3: 
- Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 9 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
