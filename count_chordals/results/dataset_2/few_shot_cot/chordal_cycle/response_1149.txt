Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 8, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 4, 8, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 3, 2, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 3, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 4, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 8: (3, 5, 4, 8, 3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 5, 1, 4, 3)
- Cycle 10: (3, 5, 9, 3)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Checking cycle 1: (1, 5, 8, 4, 1) has chord (5, 4)
- Checking cycle 2: (1, 5, 3, 1) has chord (5, 3)
- Checking cycle 3: (1, 5, 4, 8, 1) has chord (5, 8)
- Checking cycle 4: (1, 3, 7, 0, 1) has no chord
- Checking cycle 5: (1, 3, 2, 1) has no chord
- Checking cycle 6: (1, 3, 8, 5, 1) has chord (3, 5)
- Checking cycle 7: (1, 4, 8, 5, 1) has chord (4, 8)
- Checking cycle 8: (3, 5, 4, 8, 3) has chord (5, 8)
- Checking cycle 9: (3, 5, 1, 4, 3) has no chord
- Checking cycle 10: (3, 5, 9, 3) has no chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are [5] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5, 4), 8, 1>
- <1, (5, 3), 1>
- <1, (5, 8), 4, 1>
- <1, 3, (5, 8), 1>
- <3, (5, 8), 4, 3>
