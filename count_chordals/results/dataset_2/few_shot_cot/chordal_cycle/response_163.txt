Response:
Let's follow the steps to find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: <9, 26, 3, 15, 9>
- Cycle 2: <20, 9, 26, 22, 20>
- Cycle 3: <3, 15, 10, 14, 3>
- Cycle 4: <20, 0, 24, 11, 22, 20>
- Cycle 5: <9, 26, 22, 14, 29, 27, 16, 18, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <9, 26, 3, 15, 9> has a chord: (3, 15)
- <20, 9, 26, 22, 20> has a chord: (9, 22)
- <3, 15, 10, 14, 3> has a chord: (15, 14)
- <20, 0, 24, 11, 22, 20> has a chord: (0, 11)
- <9, 26, 22, 14, 29, 27, 16, 18, 9> has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [1].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <9, 26, 22, 14, 29, 27, 16, 18, 9> and the total count of chordless cycles is [1].
