Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 3, 1, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 6, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 2, 7, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 8, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 8, 0, 6, 5)
- Cycle 8: (9, 4, 7, 5, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 3, 1, 5, 9)
- Cycle 10: (9, 7, 4, 5, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 7, 3, 1, 9)
- Cycle 12: (4, 7, 9, 3, 4)
- Cycle 13: (7, 9, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 9, 4, 5, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 4, 9, 3, 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 3, 9, 1, 7)
- Cycle 17: (7, 2, 1, 3, 7)
- Cycle 18: (7, 2, 8, 5, 7)
- Cycle 19: (1, 9, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 20: (3, 9, 1, 7, 3)
- Cycle 21: (3, 9, 4, 7, 3)
- Cycle 22: (3, 4, 7, 9, 3)
- Cycle 23: (8, 5, 7, 4, 8)
- Cycle 24: (8, 7, 9, 3, 8)
- Cycle 25: (2, 7, 4, 9, 2)
- Cycle 26: (2, 1, 9, 5, 2)
- Cycle 27: (2, 8, 7, 4, 2)
- Cycle 28: (2, 6, 5, 8, 2)
- Cycle 29: (0, 5, 8, 7, 0)
- Cycle 30: (0, 6, 7, 4, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 16: (7, 3, 9, 1, 7) has one chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 25: (2, 7, 4, 9, 2) has one chord (7, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the answer is [2].
Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <7, (3, 9), 1, 7>
- <2, (7, 9), 4, 2>
