Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 8, 13, 7, 1> with 1 chord <1, 12>
- Cycle <0, 8, 13, 16, 7> with 1 chord <8, 16>
- Cycle <11, 12, 17, 15, 1> with 1 chord <12, 1>
- Cycle <11, 12, 17, 18, 9> with 1 chord <12, 9>
- Cycle <11, 17, 15, 19, 5> with 1 chord <15, 5>
- Cycle <13, 16, 14, 6, 4> with 1 chord <16, 6>
- Cycle <13, 16, 14, 6, 14> with 1 chord <16, 14>
- Cycle <15, 19, 5, 0, 8> with 1 chord <5, 8>
- Cycle <17, 15, 19, 5, 0> with 1 chord <15, 0>
- Cycle <17, 18, 9, 4, 2> with 1 chord <9, 2>

Step 2: Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 8, 13, 7> with chord (7, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle <11, 12, 17, 15> with chord (12, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle <17, 15, 19, 5> with chord (15, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle <13, 16, 14, 6> with chord (16, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle <15, 19, 5, 0> with chord (5, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle <17, 18, 9, 4> with chord (9, 2)

Step 3: Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found, we get [6].
