Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 6, 3>

- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 6, 3, 9>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 6, 8, 9>
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 3, 6>
- Cycle 6: <0, 9, 8, 6>
- Cycle 7: <0, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 8: <0, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle 9: <0, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle 10: <0, 7, 4, 3, 1>
- Cycle 11: <0, 7, 4, 2, 3>
- Cycle 12: <0, 7, 8, 6>
- Cycle 13: <0, 2, 4, 7>
- Cycle 14: <0, 2, 4, 3>
- Cycle 15: <0, 2, 4, 7, 8>
- Cycle 16: <0, 2, 8, 6>
- Cycle 17: <1, 4, 7, 2>
- Cycle 18: <1, 4, 3, 9>
- Cycle 19: <2, 4, 7, 8>
- Cycle 20: <3, 1, 4, 7>
- Cycle 21: <3, 1, 4, 2>
- Cycle 22: <3, 4, 7, 8>
- Cycle 23: <6, 5, 0, 9>
- Cycle 24: <6, 5, 0, 7>
- Cycle 25: <6, 5, 0, 2>
- Cycle 26: <6, 5, 0, 7, 8>
- Cycle 27: <6, 8, 7, 4>
- Cycle 28: <6, 8, 2, 4>
- Cycle 29: <7, 4, 1, 3>
- Cycle 30: <7, 4, 3, 6>
- Cycle 31: <7, 4, 2, 0>
- Cycle 32: <7, 4, 3, 1>
- Cycle 33: <7, 4, 2, 3>
- Cycle 34: <7, 8, 6, 5>
- Cycle 35: <7, 8, 2, 4>
- Cycle 36: <8, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 37: <8, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle 38: <8, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle 39: <9, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle 40: <9, 8, 7, 4>

Step 2:
The only chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 5, 6, 3> with the chord (2, 9).

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the count is [1].
