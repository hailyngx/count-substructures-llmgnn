Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 13) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 8) (6, 14) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 8) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 11) (11, 5) (11, 10) (11, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 14) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 6) (0, 1) (0, 11) (0, 14) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (13, 5) (13, 7) (13, 0) (13, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 11, 14, 13, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 0, 14, and node 13
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 10, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, 12, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 14, 2, 12, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 12, 13, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 10, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 11
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 10, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 6
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        1. <0, 1, 4, 7>
        2. <0, 1, 7, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        For the cycle <0, 1, 4, 7> we have one chord (1, 4), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        Only 1 chordal 4-cycle is found.
        
Therefore, the final answer is [1].
