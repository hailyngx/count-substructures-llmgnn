Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 11) (13, 9) (5, 13) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 10) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 12) (12, 7) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 9) (11, 2) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (2, 14) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 2) (10, 5) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 1)

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in this graph are as follows:
<0, 3, (14, 2), 4)>
<2, 5, (12, 9), 11)>
<3, 8, (0, 4), 1)>
<9, 10, (1, 5), 13)>
<10, 5, (6, 1), 9)>
<5, 13, (9, 12), 6)>
<12, 2, (14, 4), 7)>

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
