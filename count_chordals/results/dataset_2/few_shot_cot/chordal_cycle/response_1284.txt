Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord: 
- <0, 7, 9, 5> has the chord (0, 5)
- <0, 3, 14, 9> has the chord (3, 9)
- <0, 11, 13, 2> has the chord (11, 13)
- <0, 4, 12, 6> has the chord (4, 6)
- <1, 5, 9, 14> has the chord (5, 14)
- <2, 5, 9, 13> has the chord (5, 13)
- <2, 7, 9, 13> has the chord (7, 13)
- <4, 10, 14, 9> has the chord (10, 9)
- <4, 10, 2, 13> has the chord (10, 13)
- <4, 12, 6, 10> has the chord (6, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = 82 - 10 = 72
Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [72].
