Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 11) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (13, 12) (13, 3) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (0, 13) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 11) (3, 6) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 5) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 12) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (12, 5) (1, 8) (1, 5) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 5) (14, 10) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 14) (10, 2) (10, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 13, 2, 7, 3, 12, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 4, 0, 10, 7, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 13, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 3, 7, 12, 1, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 11, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 11, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 2, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 14, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 13, 0, 11, and node 5
Node 13 is connected to node 12, 3, 14, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 13, 11, 5, and node 10

Response:
There are two chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles are: 
<0, 5, 14, 13> with chord 12,
<2, 11, 14, 10> with chord 14.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
