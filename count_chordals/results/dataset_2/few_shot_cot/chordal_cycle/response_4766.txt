Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <1, 6, 9, 0, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 6, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 6, 9, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 3, 9, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 7, 8, 9, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 7, 5, 1, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 7, 5, 1, 6, 9, 0>
- Cycle 8: <1, 6, 4, 0, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 6, 4, 3, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 7, 5, 1>
- Cycle 11: <1, 7, 8, 9, 1>
- Cycle 12: <1, 7, 8, 3, 1>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <1, 6, 9, 3, 1> with chord (3, 9)
- Chordal Cycle 2: <0, 4, 6, 9, 0> with chord (4, 6)
- Chordal Cycle 3: <0, 4, 3, 9, 0> with chord (3, 4)
- Chordal Cycle 4: <0, 7, 8, 9, 0> with chord (7, 8)
- Chordal Cycle 5: <0, 7, 5, 1, 0> with chord (5, 7)

Step 3:
As we have found 5 unique chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [5].
