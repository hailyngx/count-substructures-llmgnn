This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2)

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 4, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 1, 7>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 1, 8>
- Cycle 4: <0, 2, 6, 9>
- Cycle 5: <0, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle 6: <0, 7, 5, 8>
- Cycle 7: <0, 6, 2, 8>
- Cycle 8: <1, 9, 4, 7>
- Cycle 9: <1, 9, 5, 7>
- Cycle 10: <1, 8, 5, 7>
- Cycle 11: <2, 6, 8, 5>
- Cycle 12: <3, 5, 9, 1>
- Cycle 13: <3, 5, 9, 4>
- Cycle 14: <3, 7, 1, 8>
- Cycle 15: <4, 9, 6, 2>
- Cycle 16: <4, 7, 3, 5>
- Cycle 17: <5, 9, 6, 2>
- Cycle 18: <5, 7, 1, 9>
- Cycle 19: <5, 7, 3, 2>
- Cycle 20: <6, 9, 5, 7>
- Cycle 21: <6, 9, 4, 7>
- Cycle 22: <6, 2, 3, 5>
- Cycle 23: <7, 5, 8, 6>
- Cycle 24: <8, 5, 9, 4>
- Cycle 25: <8, 5, 7, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 4, 7> has chord (9, 4)
- <0, 9, 1, 7> has chord (9, 1)
- <0, 9, 1, 8> has chord (9, 1)
- <0, 2, 6, 9> has chord (2, 6)
- <0, 7, 4, 8> has chord (4, 8)
- <0, 7, 5, 8> has chord (5, 8)
- <0, 6, 2, 8> has chord (6, 2)
- <1, 9, 4, 7> has chord (4, 7)
- <1, 9, 5, 7> has chord (5, 7)
- <1, 8, 5, 7> has chord (5, 7)
- <2, 6, 8, 5> has chord (6, 8)
- <3, 5, 9, 1> has chord (5, 9)
- <3, 5, 9, 4> has chord (5, 9)
- <3, 7, 1, 8> has chord (1, 8)
- <4, 9, 6, 2> has chord (6, 2)
- <4, 7, 3, 5> has chord (3, 5)
- <5, 9, 6, 2> has chord (6, 2)
- <5, 7, 1, 9> has chord (1, 9)
- <5, 7, 3, 2> has chord (3, 2)
- <6, 9, 5, 7> has chord (5, 7)
- <6, 9, 4, 7> has chord (4, 7)
- <6, 2, 3, 5> has chord (3, 5)
- <7, 5, 8, 6> has chord (8, 6)
- <8, 5, 9, 4> has chord (9, 4)
- <8, 5, 7, 4> has chord (5, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
