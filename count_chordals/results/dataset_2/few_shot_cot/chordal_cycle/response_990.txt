Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- <0, 13, 9, 4>
- <0, 13, 8, 12>
- <0, 14, 5, 11>
- <0, 14, 4, 11>
- <1, 8, 13, 9>
- <1, 8, 10, 6>
- <1, 8, 12, 14>
- <1, 6, 7, 2>
- <1, 6, 10, 0>
- <1, 11, 5, 14>
- <1, 11, 7, 3>
- <2, 10, 8, 12>
- <2, 10, 0, 14>
- <2, 7, 6, 1>
- <2, 7, 1, 11>
- <3, 5, 11, 7>
- <3, 5, 14, 0>
- <3, 7, 6, 1>
- <3, 7, 11, 4>
- <4, 9, 13, 8>
- <4, 9, 11, 5>
- <4, 9, 13, 0>
- <4, 2, 7, 6>
- <4, 2, 10, 8>
- <4, 0, 14, 5>
- <4, 0, 10, 3>
- <5, 11, 7, 3>
- <6, 1, 8, 13>
- <6, 1, 7, 11>
- <6, 7, 2, 10>
- <7, 6, 10, 2>
- <8, 13, 9, 4>
- <8, 13, 0, 14>
- <8, 10, 12, 14>
- <9, 4, 11, 7>
- <9, 4, 0, 14>
- <10, 8, 13, 9>
- <10, 8, 12, 14>
- <10, 6, 1, 11>
- <11, 5, 14, 0>
- <12, 8, 13, 9>
- <12, 8, 10, 6>
- <13, 9, 4, 11>
- <14, 5, 11, 7>

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 13, 9, 4> has one chord: (13, 9)
- <0, 14, 5, 11> has one chord: (14, 11)
- <0, 14, 4, 11> has no chord
- <1, 8, 13, 9> has one chord: (8, 9)
- <1, 11, 5, 14> has one chord: (11, 5)
- <2, 10, 0, 14> has one chord: (10, 14)
- <3, 7, 11, 4> has one chord: (7, 11)
- <4, 9, 11, 5> has one chord: (9, 5)
- <6, 7, 2, 10> has one chord: (7, 2)
- <8, 10, 12, 14> has one chord: (10, 12)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found.
So, the final count is [9].
