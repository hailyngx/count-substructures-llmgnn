Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 0>
- <0, 1, 2, 0>
- <0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 2, 8, 1>
- <0, 1, 4, 9, 7, 3, 0>
- <0, 6, 7, 9, 4, 8, 1, 0>
- <1, 2, 7, 4, 8, 2, 1>
- <1, 3, 4, 9, 7, 6, 0, 1>
- <1, 3, 7, 6, 2, 8, 1>
- <2, 6, 7, 3, 9, 4, 8, 2>
- <3, 4, 9, 7, 6, 2, 1, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 1, 2, 0> has chord (1, 2)
- <0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 2, 8, 1> has chord (2, 8)
- <0, 1, 4, 9, 7, 3, 0> has chord (1, 4)
- <0, 6, 7, 9, 4, 8, 1, 0> has chord (1, 4)
- <1, 2, 7, 4, 8, 2, 1> has chord (1, 4)
- <1, 3, 4, 9, 7, 6, 0, 1> has chord (1, 4)
- <1, 3, 7, 6, 2, 8, 1> has chord (1, 7)
- <2, 6, 7, 3, 9, 4, 8, 2> has chord (2, 7)
- <3, 4, 9, 7, 6, 2, 1, 3> has chord (3, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
