- Cycle 29: <7, 0, 4, 9, 5>
- Cycle 30: <8, 9, 5, 2, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (7, 8), 9, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (7, 8), 1, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (3, 9), 8, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, (4, 9), 5, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, (4, 6), 1, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (6, 4), 9, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, (6, 5), 9, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, (2, 5), 9, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <2, (7, 8), 9, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <2, (5, 6), 1, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <3, (0, 7), 8, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <3, (4, 9), 5, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <4, (9, 5), 2, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <5, (9, 8), 1, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <5, (9, 4), 6, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <8, (9, 5), 2, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are [14] chordless 4-cycles.
