- <13, 4, 5, 6> (Cycle of length 4)
- <14, 9, 6, 5> (Cycle of length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 6, 5, 7> has a chord 6
- The cycle <1, 4, 5, 7> has a chord 4
- The cycle <2, 9, 6, 5> has a chord 9
- The cycle <3, 13, 4, 5> has a chord 13
- The cycle <5, 6, 9, 10> has a chord 9
- The cycle <6, 9, 10, 11> has a chord 10
- The cycle <9, 6, 5, 4> has a chord 6

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
There are 6 unique chordal cycles found, therefore the final count is [6].
