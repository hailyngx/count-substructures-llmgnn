Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (7, 5, 9, 6)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 1, 7)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 9, 6)
- Cycle 4: (0, 5, 9, 1)
- Cycle 5: (0, 5, 1, 3)
- Cycle 6: (0, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 7: (2, 6, 5, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (5, 1)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (1, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 3 chordless cycles found, so the final answer is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, (7, 5), 9, 6>
- <0, (5, 9), 6, 5>
- <0, (5, 1), 6, 9>
