Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
1. Cycle <0, 4, 8, 1, 0>
2. Cycle <0, 4, 2, 9, 0>
3. Cycle <0, 4, 2, 7, 0>
4. Cycle <0, 4, 3, 6, 1, 0>
5. Cycle <1, 8, 4, 2, 7, 1>
6. Cycle <2, 4, 8, 5, 2>
7. Cycle <2, 4, 3, 6, 7, 2>
8. Cycle <3, 4, 8, 5, 3>
9. Cycle <6, 1, 8, 5, 6>
10. Cycle <7, 2, 4, 8, 1, 7>
11. Cycle <7, 2, 9, 8, 1, 7>
12. Cycle <7, 2, 9, 0, 7>
13. Cycle <7, 2, 4, 3, 6, 7>
14. Cycle <8, 4, 3, 6, 1, 8>
15. Cycle <8, 4, 0, 1, 8>
16. Cycle <8, 4, 0, 7, 8>
17. Cycle <8, 5, 2, 9, 8>
18. Cycle <8, 5, 3, 6, 8>
19. Cycle <9, 2, 4, 8, 1, 9>
20. Cycle <9, 2, 4, 3, 6, 9>

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are: 
1. Chordal 4-cycle <0, (4, 8), 2, 9>
2. Chordal 4-cycle <0, (4, 2), 7, 0>
3. Chordal 4-cycle <7, (2, 9), 8, 1, 7>

Step 3: 
The total number of chordless cycles found is [17].
