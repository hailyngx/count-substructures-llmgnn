Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 9, 8, 2, 1, 7, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 9, 8, 5, 11, 16, 5>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 9, 10, 7, 4, 14, 12>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 9, 10, 3, 10, 7, 4>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 17, 15, 2, 1, 7, 4>
- Cycle 6: <0, 19, 15, 2, 1, 7, 4, 14>
- Cycle 7: <0, 19, 15, 2, 1, 13, 14, 4>
- Cycle 8: <1, 7, 4, 6, 17, 15, 19, 0>
- Cycle 9: <1, 7, 4, 14, 12, 7, 10, 3>
- Cycle 10: <1, 7, 10, 9, 8, 2, 15, 18>
- Cycle 11: <1, 13, 14, 4, 6, 17, 15, 2>
- Cycle 12: <2, 8, 9, 10, 7, 4, 14, 13>
- Cycle 13: <2, 15, 17, 6, 0, 19, 15, 18>
- Cycle 14: <4, 6, 17, 15, 2, 8, 9, 10>
- Cycle 15: <4, 6, 17, 15, 19, 0, 6, 18>
- Cycle 16: <4, 6, 9, 8, 5, 11, 16, 5>
- Cycle 17: <4, 14, 13, 1, 7, 10, 3, 10>
- Cycle 18: <5, 8, 9, 10, 7, 4, 6, 0>
- Cycle 19: <5, 11, 16, 5, 10, 3, 10, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 6, 9, 10, 3, 10, 7, 4> has chord (9, 3)
- <1, 7, 10, 9, 8, 2, 15, 18> has chord (10, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are [18] chordless 4-cycles in the graph.
