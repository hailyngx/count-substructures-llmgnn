Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 6, 5, 8>
- <0, 6, 7, 1>
- <0, 6, 7, 9>
- <0, 6, 7, 8>
- <0, 6, 7, 3>
- <0, 9, 7, 1>
- <0, 9, 7, 8>
- <0, 9, 7, 3>
- <0, 4, 3, 8>
- <0, 4, 5, 8>
- <0, 4, 5, 3>
- <0, 3, 4, 5>
- <1, 9, 7, 8>
- <1, 9, 7, 3>
- <3, 4, 5, 8>
- <3, 4, 5, 0>
- <3, 4, 5, 1>
- <3, 4, 0, 6>
- <5, 6, 7, 1>
- <5, 6, 7, 9>
- <5, 6, 7, 8>
- <5, 6, 7, 3>
- <7, 8, 5, 3>
- <7, 8, 5, 6>
- <7, 8, 5, 1>
- <7, 8, 1, 5>
- <7, 8, 1, 3>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <0, 3, 4, 5>

Step 3:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
