Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- <11, 16, 13, 8, 1>
- <11, 16, 4, 2, 9>
- <11, 5, 7, 14, 3, 6, 1>
- <11, 17, 0, 15, 2, 9, 14, 3, 6, 18, 13>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <11, 16, 13, 8, 1> has a chord (13, 8).
- <11, 16, 4, 2, 9> has a chord (4, 2).
- <11, 5, 7, 14, 3, 6, 1> has a chord (7, 1).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <11, 16, 13, 8, 1>.
