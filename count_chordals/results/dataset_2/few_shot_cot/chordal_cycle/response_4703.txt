Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle 1: <6, 7, 2, 9>
2. Cycle 2: <6, 3, 5, 1>
3. Cycle 3: <6, 4, 0, 2>
4. Cycle 4: <6, 8, 0, 4>
5. Cycle 5: <4, 0, 5, 3>
6. Cycle 6: <2, 0, 5, 1>
7. Cycle 7: <2, 8, 5, 1>
8. Cycle 8: <2, 7, 9, 4>
9. Cycle 9: <7, 9, 4, 0>
10. Cycle 10: <6, 3, 1, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Among the listed cycles, only Cycle 1: <6, 7, 2, 9> has exactly one chord which is chord (7, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<6, 7, 2, 9> with chord (7, 9)
