Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 20, 14, 13> (length 4)
- <0, 20, 21, 25> (length 4)
- <0, 3, 28, 13> (length 4)
- <0, 24, 16, 22> (length 4)
- <2, 9, 6, 5> (length 4)
- <2, 9, 27, 5> (length 4)
- <5, 12, 17, 21> (length 4)
- <5, 12, 13, 28> (length 4)
- <8, 18, 4, 7> (length 4)
- <8, 18, 22, 16> (length 4)
- <10, 5, 27, 9> (length 4)
- <10, 5, 12, 17> (length 4)
- <10, 22, 16, 24> (length 4)
- <13, 28, 7, 4> (length 4)
- <13, 28, 3, 0> (length 4)
- <13, 14, 0, 20> (length 4)
- <14, 20, 0, 3> (length 4)
- <15, 25, 8, 18> (length 4)
- <15, 29, 1, 26> (length 4)
- <16, 22, 8, 25> (length 4)
- <16, 22, 10, 23> (length 4)
- <16, 26, 29, 15> (length 4)
- <19, 2, 0, 3> (length 4)
- <19, 2, 9, 6> (length 4)
- <19, 11, 26, 16> (length 4)
- <21, 17, 12, 5> (length 4)
- <21, 17, 12, 13> (length 4)
- <21, 25, 15, 29> (length 4)
- <23, 16, 22, 10> (length 4)
- <24, 16, 26, 29> (length 4)
- <27, 9, 2, 19> (length 4)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 20, 14, 13> has a chord (0, 14)
- The cycle <2, 9, 6, 5> has a chord (9, 6)
- The cycle <5, 12, 17, 21> has a chord (12, 17)
- The cycle <8, 18, 4, 7> has a chord (18, 7)
- The cycle <10, 5, 12, 17> has a chord (5, 12)
- The cycle <13, 14, 0, 20> has a chord (14, 20)
- The cycle <15, 25, 8, 18> has a chord (25, 8)
- The cycle <19, 11, 26, 16> has a chord (11, 26)
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 27 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [27].
