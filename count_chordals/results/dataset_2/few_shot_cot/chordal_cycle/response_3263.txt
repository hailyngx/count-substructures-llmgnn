Response:
[4]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <3, (0, 20), 16>
Explanation: 
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: 0 - 3 - 20 - 16 - 0
- Cycle 2: 3 - 8 - 13 - 27 - 3
- Cycle 3: 3 - 11 - 19 - 26 - 3
- Cycle 4: 4 - 8 - 13 - 27 - 4
- Cycle 5: 5 - 1 - 24 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 6: 6 - 14 - 5 - 29 - 6
- Cycle 7: 6 - 19 - 21 - 7 - 6
- Cycle 8: 9 - 17 - 28 - 23 - 9
- Cycle 9: 10 - 7 - 21 - 19 - 10
- Cycle 10: 10 - 15 - 22 - 0 - 10
- Cycle 11: 12 - 27 - 20 - 16 - 12
- Cycle 12: 12 - 26 - 19 - 11 - 12
- Cycle 13: 15 - 10 - 7 - 21 - 15
- Cycle 14: 22 - 10 - 26 - 19 - 22
- Cycle 15: 23 - 18 - 2 - 12 - 23
- Cycle 16: 24 - 1 - 5 - 14 - 24
- Cycle 17: 24 - 6 - 19 - 26 - 24
- Cycle 18: 25 - 6 - 14 - 5 - 25
- Cycle 19: 29 - 9 - 17 - 28 - 29

Step 2:
Only Cycle 1: 0 - 3 - 20 - 16 - 0 has exactly one chord (3, 20).

Step 3:
Therefore, there is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph.
