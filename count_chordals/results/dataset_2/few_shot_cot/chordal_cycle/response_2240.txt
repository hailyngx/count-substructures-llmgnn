Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 6, 4, 9>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 5, 13, 7>
- Cycle 4: <0, 2, 12, 13, 7>
- Cycle 5: <0, 10, 11, 14, 7>
- Cycle 6: <1, 8, 12, 7, 14>
- Cycle 7: <3, 5, 13, 12, 7>
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 8, 14, 11>
- Cycle 9: <4, 6, 0, 3, 5>
- Cycle 10: <4, 6, 3, 9, 14>
- Cycle 11: <4, 9, 12, 13, 7>
- Cycle 12: <7, 14, 4, 3, 0>
- Cycle 13: <8, 5, 3, 0, 10>
- Cycle 14: <8, 5, 2, 12, 7>
- Cycle 15: <9, 12, 7, 1, 8>
- Cycle 16: <9, 12, 7, 13, 5>
- Cycle 17: <9, 14, 11, 10, 0>

Step 2:

The cycles with exactly one chord (a non-adjacent edge) are:
- <0, 3, 5, 8, 1> with chord (8, 1)
- <0, 3, 6, 4, 9> with chord (6, 9)
- <0, 2, 12, 13, 7> with chord (2, 12)
- <0, 10, 11, 14, 7> with chord (10, 11)
- <1, 8, 12, 7, 14> with chord (8, 14)
- <3, 5, 13, 12, 7> with chord (5, 13)
- <4, 6, 0, 3, 5> with chord (6, 4)
- <4, 6, 3, 9, 14> with chord (9, 14)
- <9, 12, 7, 1, 8> with chord (1, 8)
- <9, 14, 11, 10, 0> with chord (10, 11)

Step 3:

The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [10].
