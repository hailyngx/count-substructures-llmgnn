Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 3) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- <0, 2, 4, 5>
- <0, 1, 5, 7>
- <0, 1, 2, 7>
- <1, 2, 4, 5>
- <2, 4, 6, 3>
- <3, 4, 6, 8>
- <4, 5, 7, 3>
- <4, 5, 6, 3>
- <4, 6, 8, 3>
- <5, 6, 8, 7>
- <6, 8, 9, 4>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, 2, 4, 5, (1, 7)>
- <0, 1, 5, 7, (2, 4)>
- <1, 2, 4, 5, (7, 3)>
- <2, 4, 6, 3, (0, 7)>
- <3, 4, 6, 8, (7, 5)>
- <4, 5, 7, 3, (6, 8)>
- <4, 5, 6, 3, (9, 7)>
- <4, 6, 8, 3, (5, 7)>
- <5, 6, 8, 7, (1, 4)>
- <6, 8, 9, 4, (3, 5)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
