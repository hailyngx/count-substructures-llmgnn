Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 7, 4, 14>
- <0, 7, 11, 14>
- <0, 7, 4, 17>
- <0, 2, 18, 14>
- <0, 2, 18, 13>
- <0, 2, 8, 5>
- <0, 2, 8, 16>
- <0, 19, 17, 14>
- <0, 19, 17, 4>
- <0, 19, 17, 14>
- <0, 19, 17, 19>
- <1, 15, 5, 8>
- <1, 15, 9, 3>
- <1, 15, 9, 2>
- <1, 15, 9, 10>
- <1, 15, 5, 8>
- <1, 15, 9, 3>
- <1, 15, 9, 2>
- <1, 15, 9, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, (7, 14), 4>
- <0, (7, 11), 14>
- <0, (4, 17), 7>
- <0, (2, 18), 14>
- <0, (2, 18), 13>
- <0, (8, 16), 2>
- <0, (19, 17), 14>
- <0, (19, 17), 4>
- <1, (15, 5), 8>
- <1, (15, 9), 3>
- <1, (15, 9), 2>
- <1, (15, 9), 10>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [4]
Chordal 4-cycles: <0, (4, 17), 7>, <0, (2, 18), 14>, <1, (15, 5), 8>, <1, (15, 9), 3>
