Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 0) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 8, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- From the given edges, we can identify the cycles of length 4 or more in the graph as follows:
  1. Cycle 1: 0 - 1 - 7 - 4 - 0
  2. Cycle 2: 0 - 6 - 4 - 7 - 0
  3. Cycle 3: 1 - 7 - 4 - 6 - 1
  4. Cycle 4: 0 - 7 - 4 - 6 - 0
  5. Cycle 5: 7 - 4 - 6 - 9 - 7
  6. Cycle 6: 7 - 4 - 3 - 8 - 7
  7. Cycle 7: 0 - 6 - 5 - 1 - 0
  8. Cycle 8: 0 - 8 - 5 - 6 - 0
  9. Cycle 9: 5 - 6 - 4 - 2 - 5
  10. Cycle 10: 7 - 1 - 5 - 8 - 7
  11. Cycle 11: 7 - 1 - 9 - 6 - 7
  12. Cycle 12: 9 - 7 - 8 - 3 - 9
  13. Cycle 13: 9 - 6 - 5 - 1 - 9

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
  1. Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle <0, (1, 7), 4>.
  2. Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle <0, (6, 4), 7>.
  3. Cycle 3 is not a chordal 4-cycle (more than one chord present).
  4. Cycle 4 is a chordal 4-cycle <0, (4, 6), 7>.
  5. Cycle 5 is a chordal 4-cycle <7, (4, 6), 9>.
  6. Cycle 6 is not a chordal 4-cycle (more than one chord present).
  7. Cycle 7 is a chordal 4-cycle <0, (5, 6), 1>.
  8. Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle <0, (5, 6), 8>.
  9. Cycle 9 is a chordal 4-cycle <5, (2, 4), 6>.
  10. Cycle 10 is a chordal 4-cycle <1, (5, 8), 7>.
  11. Cycle 11 is a chordal 4-cycle <7, (1, 9), 6>.
  12. Cycle 12 is a chordal 4-cycle <9, (3, 8), 7>.
  13. Cycle 13 is a chordal 4-cycle <9, (1, 5), 6>.

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [6]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, (1, 7), 4>
<0, (6, 4), 7>
<0, (4, 6), 7>
<7, (4, 6), 9>
<0, (5, 6), 1>
<0, (5, 6), 8>
