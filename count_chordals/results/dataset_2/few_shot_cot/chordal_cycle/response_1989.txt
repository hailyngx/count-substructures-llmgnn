Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 18, 16, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 16, 23, 21, 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 14, 19, 22, 17, 6, 21, 8, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 14, 19, 25, 20, 11, 22, 17, 4, 24, 9, 12, 28, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 14, 19, 25, 8, 0, 16, 18, 23, 21, 6, 26, 2, 4, 24, 9, 25, 27, 15, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 15, 27, 21, 6, 26, 3, 12, 28, 13, 1, 29, 15, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (18, 23).
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (14, 25).
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (19, 28).
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (14, 27).
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (15, 21).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 1 chordless cycle found. 

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
