Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 3, 6, 9, 5>
2. <1, 0, 5, 2, 9>
3. <2, 6, 9, 1, 0>
4. <3, 6, 9, 5, 7>
5. <4, 1, 9, 8, 7>
6. <5, 9, 6, 7, 5>
7. <6, 9, 8, 7, 3>
8. <7, 8, 9, 5, 7>
9. <8, 9, 6, 3, 0>
10. <9, 6, 7, 8, 1>

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 3, 6, 9, 5> has 1 chord: (0, 6)
- Cycle <1, 0, 5, 2, 9> has 1 chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle <2, 6, 9, 1, 0> has 1 chord: (2, 1)
- Cycle <3, 6, 9, 5, 7> has 1 chord: (3, 5)
- Cycle <4, 1, 9, 8, 7> has 1 chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle <5, 9, 6, 7, 5> has 1 chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle <6, 9, 8, 7, 3> has 1 chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle <7, 8, 9, 5, 7> has 1 chord: (7, 9)
- Cycle <8, 9, 6, 3, 0> has 1 chord: (8, 6)
- Cycle <9, 6, 7, 8, 1> has 1 chord: (9, 7)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 0 chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
