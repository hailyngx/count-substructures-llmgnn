Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 13) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 14) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 5) (1, 10) (2, 10) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 6) (11, 8) (11, 2) (11, 5) (11, 4) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 1) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 3) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 4) (3, 10) (3, 5) (10, 6) (10, 1) (10, 2) (10, 3) (10, 5) (5, 1) (5, 11) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 13, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 14, 5, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 10, 3, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 10, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 11, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 11, 4, 3, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 10, 11, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 11, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 5, and node 4
Node 12 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 14, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 13, 7, and node 1

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, 8, 1, 14> with exactly one chord (0, 1).

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles in the graph is [1].
