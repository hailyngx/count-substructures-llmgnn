Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are 8 cycles of length 4 in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: 1-5-2-1
- Cycle 2: 2-5-9-2
- Cycle 3: 4-9-2-4
- Cycle 4: 6-9-2-6
- Cycle 5: 6-9-8-6
- Cycle 6: 6-4-9-6
- Cycle 7: 7-9-2-7
- Cycle 8: 7-4-9-7

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- In Cycle 1: 1-5-2-1, no chord
- In Cycle 2: 2-5-9-2, no chord
- In Cycle 3: 4-9-2-4, chord: (4, 2)
- In Cycle 4: 6-9-2-6, chord: (6, 2)
- In Cycle 5: 6-9-8-6, no chord
- In Cycle 6: 6-4-9-6, chord: (4, 9)
- In Cycle 7: 7-9-2-7, no chord
- In Cycle 8: 7-4-9-7, chord: (4, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 5 chordless cycles found.

Putting the final number inside brackets, we have [5].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, (4, 2), 5)>
<1, (6, 2), 5)>
<1, (4, 9), 7)>
