Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more where every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <16, 11, 12, 4>
- Cycle 2: <4, 7, 5, 16>
- Cycle 3: <11, 19, 16, 5>
- Cycle 4: <7, 17, 8, 1>
- Cycle 5: <4, 12, 15, 10>
- Cycle 6: <15, 0, 18, 4>
- Cycle 7: <14, 9, 17, 7>
- Cycle 8: <9, 16, 5, 7>
- Cycle 9: <16, 19, 11, 12>
- Cycle 10: <18, 4, 14, 13>
- Cycle 11: <12, 11, 16, 5>
- Cycle 12: <2, 6, 3, 14>
- Cycle 13: <18, 10, 2, 7>
- Cycle 14: <15, 12, 4, 7>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <16, 11, 12, 4>, Chord: (11, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, 7, 5, 16>, Chord: (7, 16)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <11, 19, 16, 5>, Chord: (19, 16)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, 17, 8, 1>, Chord: (17, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, 12, 15, 10>, Chord: (12, 15)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <15, 0, 18, 4>, Chord: (0, 18)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <14, 9, 17, 7>, Chord: (9, 17)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <9, 16, 5, 7>, Chord: (16, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <16, 19, 11, 12>, Chord: (19, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <18, 4, 14, 13>, Chord: (4, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <12, 11, 16, 5>, Chord: (11, 16)
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <2, 6, 3, 14>, Chord: (6, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <18, 10, 2, 7>, Chord: (10, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <15, 12, 4, 7>, Chord: (12, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:

There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [14].
