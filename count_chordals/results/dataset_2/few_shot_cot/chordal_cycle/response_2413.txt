Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 4-9-6-5-4
- Cycle 2: 1-6-5-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-9-8-2-7-1
- Cycle 4: 0-9-6-5-0
- Cycle 5: 0-9-8-2-5-0
- Cycle 6: 0-4-9-8-2-0
- Cycle 7: 0-4-1-6-5-0

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (4, 9), 5>
- Cycle 2: <2, (1, 6), 5>
- Cycle 3: <1, (9, 8), 7>
- Cycle 4: <0, (9, 6), 5>
- Cycle 5: <0, (9, 8), 5>
- Cycle 6: <0, (9, 8), 4>
- Cycle 7: <0, (4, 1), 5>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 3 chordless cycles: 
  - Cycle 2: 1-6-5-2-1
  - Cycle 4: 0-9-6-5-0
  - Cycle 7: 0-4-1-6-5-0

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [3].
