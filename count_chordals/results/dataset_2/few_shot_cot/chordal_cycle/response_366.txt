Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 4, 5, 1> with chord (0, 1)
2. Cycle <0, 4, 6, 2> with chord (0, 2)
3. Cycle <1, 3, 7, 4> with chord (1, 7)
4. Cycle <2, 4, 7, 6> with chord (2, 7)
5. Cycle <3, 5, 7, 4> with chord (3, 7)

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed in Step 1, the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 4, 5, 1> with chord (0, 1)

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
