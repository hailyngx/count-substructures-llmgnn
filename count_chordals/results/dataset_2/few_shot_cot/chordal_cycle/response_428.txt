Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 7, 9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 8, 9, 4, 1)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: <(4, 7)>
- Cycle 2 has one chord: <(3, 6)>
- Cycle 3 has no chords

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, 4, 7, 9, 1> with a chord (4, 7)
<1, 3, 6, 2, 5, 1> with a chord (3, 6)
