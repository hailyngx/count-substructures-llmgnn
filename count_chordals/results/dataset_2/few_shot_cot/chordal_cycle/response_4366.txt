Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 0, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, 7, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph (nodes in cycles are listed in cyclic order):
- Cycle 1: (0, 3, 5, 8, 1, 7, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 6, 4, 2, 1, 7, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 7, 9, 4, 2, 3, 5, 8, 1, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 6, 4, 5, 8, 7, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 9, 4, 2, 1, 7, 0)
- Cycle 6: (4, 2, 3, 6, 7, 1, 9, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 5, 8, 7, 6, 3, 2, 4)
- Cycle 8: (8, 7, 6, 0, 3, 2, 1, 9, 8)
- Cycle 9: (8, 9, 4, 5, 3, 0, 7, 1, 2, 8)
- Cycle 10: (9, 0, 7, 6, 3, 2, 1, 8, 5, 9)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: <1, 7>, <5, 8>
- Cycle 2 has 2 chords: <1, 7>, <2, 4>
- Cycle 3 has 3 chords: <0, 6>, <7, 9>, <1, 8>
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: <4, 5>
- Cycle 5 has 2 chords: <1, 7>, <4, 9>
- Cycle 6 has 2 chords: <2, 3>, <6, 7>
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: <2, 4>
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: <7, 8>
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: <4, 5>
- Cycle 10 has 3 chords: <0, 7>, <2, 3>, <8, 9>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 6, 4, 5>
- <0, 6, 7, 9>
- <0, 9, 4, 2>
- <4, 2, 3, 6>
- <8, 7, 6, 0>
