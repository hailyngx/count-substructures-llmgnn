Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 3) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 1) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 8) (11, 5) (11, 14) (11, 6) (8, 1) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 6) (12, 9) (12, 3) (12, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 14) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 1) (14, 11) (14, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 10) (0, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 10, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 14, 10, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, 13, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 13, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, 11, 3, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 10, 11, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 10, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 14, 7, 0, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 14, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 11, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle <3, 5, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle <1, 4, 13, 5, 3, 1>
- Cycle <1, 4, 13, 5, 9, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle <1, 10, 6, 11, 5, 9, 14, 1>
- Cycle <1, 10, 6, 8, 2, 14, 5, 11, 6, 1>

Step 2: 
- Checking for chords in each cycle:
    - <1, 4, (13), 5, 3, 1> - Chord: (13)
    - <1, 4, (13), 5, 9, (7), 3, 1> - Chords: (13), (7)

Step 3: 
- Number of chordless 4-cycles found: [0] 

Therefore, there are no chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
