Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle <0, 10, 8, 5>
- Cycle <0, 18, 15, 2>
- Cycle <0, 1, 13, 14>
- Cycle <1, 13, 7, 17>
- Cycle <1, 13, 14, 16>
- Cycle <2, 9, 10, 0>
- Cycle <2, 9, 7, 17>
- Cycle <2, 15, 18, 0>
- Cycle <2, 4, 11, 14>
- Cycle <3, 17, 7, 13>
- Cycle <3, 8, 19, 11>
- Cycle <4, 12, 11, 14>
- Cycle <4, 12, 16, 15>
- Cycle <4, 11, 19, 5>
- Cycle <5, 8, 3, 17>
- Cycle <5, 19, 11, 14>
- Cycle <6, 17, 7, 13>
- Cycle <7, 17, 3, 8>
- Cycle <7, 13, 1, 0>
- Cycle <8, 10, 0, 1>
- Cycle <8, 19, 11, 4>
- Cycle <9, 10, 0, 18>
- Cycle <9, 2, 4, 12>
- Cycle <9, 7, 13, 14>
- Cycle <10, 0, 18, 15>
- Cycle <11, 19, 5, 3>
- Cycle <12, 4, 2, 9>
- Cycle <13, 7, 17, 3>
- Cycle <14, 11, 4, 2>
- Cycle <15, 18, 0, 10>
- Cycle <16, 15, 2, 9>
- Cycle <17, 7, 13, 1>
- Cycle <18, 0, 1, 13>
- Cycle <19, 5, 3, 8>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle <8, 3, (17, 7), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle <8, 19, (11, 4), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 10, (9, 2), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 17, (7, 13), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 13, (7, 17), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, 11, (19, 5), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle <9, 10, (0, 18), 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle <14, 11, (19, 5), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 8, (3, 17), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle <18, 0, (1, 13), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle <15, 2, (9, 7), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 4, (12, 11), 14>

Step 3:
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [12].
