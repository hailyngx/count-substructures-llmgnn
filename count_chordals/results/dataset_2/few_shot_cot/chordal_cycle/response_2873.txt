Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more:

1. Cycle: <1, 3, 6, 1>
2. Cycle: <1, 3, 7, 2, 1>
3. Cycle: <1, 8, 4, 5, 3, 1>
4. Cycle: <3, 7, 4, 9, 3>
5. Cycle: <3, 7, 4, 5, 3>
6. Cycle: <4, 8, 5, 3, 4>
7. Cycle: <4, 8, 5, 0, 4>
8. Cycle: <6, 8, 5, 3, 6>
9. Cycle: <6, 8, 4, 7, 6>
10. Cycle: <8, 4, 9, 6, 8>
11. Cycle: <8, 4, 7, 2, 8>
12. Cycle: <8, 4, 5, 0, 8>
13. Cycle: <0, 8, 4, 7, 0>

Next, let's identify the cycles with exactly one chord:
- From the above list, we can see that cycle number 12: <8, 4, 5, 0, 8> has exactly one chord (4, 0).

Finally, we count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 12 cycles. Therefore, the final answer is [12].
