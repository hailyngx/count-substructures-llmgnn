Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are many cycles of length 4 in the given graph. Let's list them:
1. (1, 3, 5, 4)
2. (1, 3, 6, 5)
3. (1, 4, 9, 2)
4. (1, 4, 5, 6)
5. (2, 3, 4, 5)
6. (2, 3, 6, 5)
7. (2, 6, 8, 5)
8. (2, 6, 1, 3)
9. (3, 4, 5, 6)
10. (4, 5, 7, 9)
11. (4, 5, 8, 6)
12. (5, 6, 8, 0)
13. (5, 6, 1, 3)
14. (6, 8, 0, 9)
15. (6, 8, 5, 7)
16. (7, 5, 4, 9)
17. (7, 5, 6, 3)
18. (8, 6, 1, 3)
19. (8, 6, 2, 9)
20. (9, 4, 5, 6)

Step 2:
- Let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. <1, (4, 9), 2>
2. <1, (5, 6), 3>
3. <2, (4, 5), 3>
4. <2, (6, 8), 5>
5. <3, (4, 5), 6>
6. <4, (5, 7), 9>
7. <4, (6, 8), 5>
8. <5, (6, 8), 0>
9. <6, (1, 3), 5>
10. <7, (4, 5), 9>
11. <8, (6, 1), 3>
12. <8, (6, 2), 9>
13. <9, (5, 6), 4>

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 13 chordal 4-cycles in total. Therefore, the final answer is [13].
