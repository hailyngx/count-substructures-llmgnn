Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 9, 6> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 6, 9> 
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 9, 3> 
- Cycle 4: <0, 2, 1, 6> 
- Cycle 5: <0, 2, 1, 9> 
- Cycle 6: <0, 2, 5, 8> 
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 9, 3> 
- Cycle 8: <1, 6, 4, 7> 
- Cycle 9: <1, 6, 8, 5> 
- Cycle 10: <1, 7, 4, 8> 
- Cycle 11: <1, 8, 5, 7> 
- Cycle 12: <1, 9, 3, 4> 
- Cycle 13: <2, 0, 3, 9> 
- Cycle 14: <2, 0, 1, 6> 
- Cycle 15: <2, 0, 1, 9> 
- Cycle 16: <2, 1, 6, 4> 
- Cycle 17: <2, 4, 6, 9> 
- Cycle 18: <2, 4, 7, 1> 
- Cycle 19: <3, 0, 2, 5> 
- Cycle 20: <4, 2, 0, 3> 
- Cycle 21: <4, 2, 5, 8> 
- Cycle 22: <4, 6, 9, 3> 
- Cycle 23: <4, 7, 1, 9> 
- Cycle 24: <5, 2, 4, 7> 
- Cycle 25: <5, 7, 1, 9> 
- Cycle 26: <6, 4, 7, 8> 
- Cycle 27: <7, 1, 6, 8> 
- Cycle 28: <8, 1, 6, 9> 


Step 2: 

The chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 6, 9, 3>, chord: (4, 7) 


Step 3: 

The final number of chordless cycles found is [27].
