Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:

1. (0, 8, 7, 1, 0)
2. (0, 8, 7, 10, 0)
3. (0, 8, 7, 17, 3, 11, 12, 14, 2, 0)
4. (0, 8, 7, 17, 3, 11, 19, 0)
5. (0, 8, 7, 10, 19, 0)
6. (0, 8, 4, 6, 15, 9, 3, 11, 12, 14, 5, 16, 14, 1, 7, 10, 0)
7. (1, 7, 0, 10, 19, 11, 12, 14, 2, 0, 8, 4, 6, 15, 9, 18, 5, 11, 3, 17, 7)
8. (3, 11, 19, 10, 7, 17, 3)
9. (3, 11, 12, 14, 5, 11)
10. (5, 11, 19, 10, 7, 1, 14, 2, 0, 8, 4, 6, 15, 9)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (2, 4), 5>
- <3, (9, 15), 12>
- <3, (17, 7), 11>
- <3, (17, 7), 15>
- <5, (16, 14), 18>
- <7, (10, 19), 5>
- <7, (17, 3), 0>
- <11, (12, 14), 19>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]
