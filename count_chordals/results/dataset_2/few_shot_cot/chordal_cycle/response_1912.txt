Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 6, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 1, 8, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 6, 3, 0, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 6, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 6, 1, 8, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 6, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 6, 1, 9, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Checking cycles 1 to 5: No chords present.
- Checking cycles 6 to 10: Chord present in cycles 6 and 7.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Number of chordless cycles = 5, so the final result is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (5, 0), 3>
- <2, (1, 5), 3>
