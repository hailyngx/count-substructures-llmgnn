Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 2, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 7, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- There are several cycles of length 4 in this graph:
1. (4, 5, 1, 9, 4)
2. (4, 6, 1, 9, 4)
3. (4, 8, 2, 5, 4)
4. (5, 7, 0, 3, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycle (4, 5, 1, 9, 4) has two chords: (5, 9) and (1, 4).
The cycle (4, 6, 1, 9, 4) has two chords: (6, 9) and (1, 4).
The cycle (4, 8, 2, 5, 4) has one chord: (8, 5).
The cycle (5, 7, 0, 3, 5) has one chord: (7, 3).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since there are no chordal 4-cycles found in this graph, the count is [0].
