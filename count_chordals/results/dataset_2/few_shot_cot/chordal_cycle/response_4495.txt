Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <0, 8, 10, 6>
2. <0, 8, 14, 3>
3. <0, 12, 2, 14>
4. <1, 5, 9, 6>
5. <1, 5, 4, 13>
6. <1, 5, 9, 12>
7. <1, 7, 9, 5>
8. <2, 13, 3, 14>
9. <4, 5, 9, 6>
10. <4, 9, 12, 2>
11. <6, 9, 5, 1>
12. <8, 10, 6, 12>
13. <8, 14, 3, 1>
14. <8, 14, 2, 12>
15. <9, 5, 1, 3>
16. <10, 6, 9, 5>
17. <11, 6, 9, 5>
18. <13, 3, 1, 5>
19. <13, 4, 5, 1>
20. <13, 8, 0, 4>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

1. <0, 8, 10, 6> has a chord between nodes 8 and 6.
2. <0, 8, 14, 3> has a chord between nodes 8 and 14.
3. <0, 12, 2, 14> has a chord between nodes 12 and 2.
4. <1, 5, 9, 6> has a chord between nodes 5 and 9.
5. <1, 5, 4, 13> has a chord between nodes 5 and 4.
6. <1, 5, 9, 12> has a chord between nodes 5 and 9.
7. <1, 7, 9, 5> has a chord between nodes 7 and 9.
8. <2, 13, 3, 14> has a chord between nodes 13 and 3.
9. <4, 5, 9, 6> has a chord between nodes 5 and 9.
10. <4, 9, 12, 2> has a chord between nodes 9 and 12.
11. <6, 9, 5, 1> has a chord between nodes 9 and 5.
12. <8, 10, 6, 12> has a chord between nodes 10 and 6.
13. <8, 14, 3, 1> has a chord between nodes 14 and 3.
14. <8, 14, 2, 12> has a chord between nodes 14 and 2.
15. <9, 5, 1, 3> has a chord between nodes 5 and 1.
16. <10, 6, 9, 5> has a chord between nodes 6 and 9.
17. <11, 6, 9, 5> has a chord between nodes 6 and 9.
18. <13, 3, 1, 5> has a chord between nodes 3 and 1.
19. <13, 4, 5, 1> has a chord between nodes 4 and 5.
20. <13, 8, 0, 4> has a chord between nodes 8 and 4.
