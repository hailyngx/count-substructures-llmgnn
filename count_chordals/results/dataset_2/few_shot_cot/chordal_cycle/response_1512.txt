Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <4, 7, 1, 16>.

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-1-16-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord, which is edge 1-16.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There were no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
