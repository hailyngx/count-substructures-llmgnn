Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 11, 5, 9> - Chord: (5, 9)
- <11, 5, 10, 14> - Chord: (10, 14)
- <5, 9, 14, 6> - Chord: (9, 14)
- <9, 14, 12, 2> - Chord: (14, 12)
- <14, 12, 16, 8> - Chord: (12, 16)
- <12, 16, 3, 11> - Chord: (16, 3)
- <16, 3, 10, 14> - Chord: (3, 10)
- <3, 10, 5, 9> - Chord: (10, 5)
- <10, 5, 11, 6> - Chord: (5, 11)
- <5, 11, 0, 18> - Chord: (11, 0)
- <11, 0, 13, 2> - Chord: (0, 13)
- <0, 13, 7, 1> - Chord: (13, 7)
- <13, 7, 2, 17> - Chord: (7, 2)
- <7, 2, 12, 16> - Chord: (2, 12)
- <2, 12, 19, 4> - Chord: (12, 19)
- <12, 19, 1, 15> - Chord: (19, 1)
- <19, 1, 0, 18> - Chord: (1, 0)
- <1, 0, 11, 3> - Chord: (0, 11)
- <0, 1, 15, 4> - Chord: (1, 15)
- <1, 15, 4, 17> - Chord: (15, 4)
- <15, 4, 19, 12> - Chord: (4, 19)
- <4, 19, 12, 16> - Chord: (19, 12)
- <19, 12, 2, 13> - Chord: (12, 2)
- <18, 16, 3, 10> - Chord: (16, 3)
- <16, 12, 2, 13> - Chord: (12, 2)

- <14, 10, 3, 16> - Chord: (10, 3)
- <10, 3, 11, 6> - Chord: (3, 11)
- <3, 16, 8, 17> - Chord: (16, 8)
- <16, 8, 17, 4> - Chord: (8, 17)
Note: All cycles have exactly one chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 29 unique chordal 4-cycles found within the graph. Therefore, the final count is [29].
