Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <2, 4, 7, 6>
- Cycle 2: <3, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 3: <6, 7, 4, 13>
- Cycle 4: <6, 3, 12, 11>
- Cycle 5: <6, 14, 7, 4>
- Cycle 6: <6, 11, 13, 5>
- Cycle 7: <6, 9, 0, 3>
- Cycle 8: <7, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle 9: <7, 6, 9, 0>
- Cycle 10: <7, 8, 4, 13>
- Cycle 11: <7, 14, 12, 3>
- Cycle 12: <8, 4, 13, 10>
- Cycle 13: <8, 0, 3, 12>
- Cycle 14: <8, 1, 13, 11>
- Cycle 15: <11, 12, 3, 0>
- Cycle 16: <11, 13, 5, 10>
- Cycle 17: <11, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 18: <12, 3, 6, 9>
- Cycle 19: <12, 11, 13, 5>
- Cycle 20: <12, 14, 2, 4>
- Cycle 21: <13, 4, 7, 6>
- Cycle 22: <13, 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle 23: <13, 5, 10, 13>
- Cycle 24: <14, 6, 3, 0>
- Cycle 25: <14, 2, 4, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The only chordal 4-cycle found is <6, (2, 13), 4> where the chord is (2, 13) connecting non-adjacent nodes 2 and 13.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 25 cycles listed, and 1 of them is chordal. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is 25 - 1 = 24.

Final Answer: [24]
