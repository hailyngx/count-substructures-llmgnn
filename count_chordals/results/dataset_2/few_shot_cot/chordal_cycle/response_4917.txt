Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 6, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 9, 17>
- Cycle 3: <0, 11, 19, 15>
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, 6, 5>
- Cycle 5: <1, 2, 6, 3>
- Cycle 6: <1, 2, 10, 9>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 11, 0>
- Cycle 8: <2, 9, 17, 4>
- Cycle 9: <3, 6, 5, 4>
- Cycle 10: <3, 6, 11, 0>
- Cycle 11: <3, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 12: <3, 9, 10, 2>
- Cycle 13: <4, 19, 16, 13>
- Cycle 14: <4, 5, 6, 3>
- Cycle 15: <4, 5, 14, 12>
- Cycle 16: <4, 17, 1, 2>
- Cycle 17: <5, 6, 3, 0>
- Cycle 18: <5, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 19: <5, 14, 12, 18>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycles:
    - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 3, 6, 5, (3, 6)>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 14, 12, 18, (14, 12)>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <9, 17, 12, 14, (17, 12)>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, 10, 2, 6, (10, 2)>
    - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <13, 16, 19, 15, (16, 19)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [5]
