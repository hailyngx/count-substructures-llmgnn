Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: (0, 14, 16, 3, 0)
        - Cycle 2: (0, 14, 7, 12, 18, 0)
        - Cycle 3: (1, 19, 0, 14, 7, 1)
        - Cycle 4: (1, 4, 11, 2, 5, 1)
        - Cycle 5: (2, 5, 19, 0, 14, 2)
        - Cycle 6: (3, 13, 8, 11, 4, 3)
        - Cycle 7: (6, 10, 19, 1, 2, 6)
        - Cycle 8: (7, 12, 18, 16, 14, 7)
        - Cycle 9: (9, 16, 14, 0, 19, 9)
        - Cycle 10: (16, 14, 7, 15, 7, 16)
        - Cycle 11: (18, 17, 9, 10, 6, 18)

Step 2: Checking for chordal cycles:
        - <1, (0, 14), 19, 7): Chord: (0, 14)
        - <2, (5, 19), 0, 14): Chord: (5, 19)
        - <3, (1, 19), 0, 14): Chord: (1, 19)
        - <4, (1, 4), 11, 2): Chord: (1, 4)
        - <5, (7, 12), 18, 16): Chord: (7, 12)
        - <6, (16, 14), 0, 19): Chord: (16, 14)
        - <7, (8, 13), 11, 4): Chord: (8, 13)
        - <8, (6, 10), 19, 1): Chord: (6, 10)
        - <9, (7, 12), 18, 16): Chord: (7, 12)
        - <10, (9, 16), 14, 0): Chord: (9, 16)
        - <11, (10, 6), 2, 5): Chord: (10, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        Since all cycles found have chords, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
