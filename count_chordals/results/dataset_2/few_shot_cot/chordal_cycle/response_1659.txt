<0, 2, 12, 19> - Chord: (2, 12)
<0, 6, 11, 17> - Chord: (6, 11)
<0, 6, 2, 12> - Chord: (6, 2)
<2, 0, 15, 4> - Chord: (0, 15)
<1, 5, 7, 17> - Chord: (5, 7)
<1, 5, 13, 0> - Chord: (5, 13)
<1, 5, 9, 13> - Chord: (5, 9)
<2, 6, 11, 10> - Chord: (6, 11)
<2, 6, 11, 17> - Chord: (6, 11)
<2, 12, 19, 3> - Chord: (12, 19)
<3, 10, 14, 12> - Chord: (10, 14)
<3, 7, 5, 13> - Chord: (7, 5)
<3, 7, 17, 11> - Chord: (7, 11)
<3, 19, 12, 14> - Chord: (12, 14)
<4, 10, 14, 12> - Chord: (10, 14)
<4, 10, 3, 7> - Chord: (10, 3)
<4, 15, 0, 13> - Chord: (0, 13)
<5, 1, 9, 5> - Chord: (1, 9)
<5, 13, 1, 9> - Chord: (1, 9)
<6, 11, 17, 7> - Chord: (11, 7)
<5, 13, 0, 15> - Chord: (0, 15)
<8, 4, 10, 14> - Chord: (4, 10)
