Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

There is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found which is:
<16, 21, 10, 9>, with the chord (16, 10) inside.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 44 chordless cycles found, therefore the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [44].
