Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 11) (9, 1) (9, 13) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 10) (4, 14) (7, 6) (7, 2) (10, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 9) (11, 10) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 2) (8, 5) (8, 11) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 11) (3, 8) (0, 13) (0, 1) (0, 2) (14, 4) (14, 10) (14, 11) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 11) (2, 1) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 8) (12, 13)

Node 9 is connected to node 5, 11, 1, 13, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 11, 12, 2, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 10, 3, 14, 8, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 10, 8, and node 13
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 8, 12, and node 0

Response:
There is a unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph:

Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 9, 11, 10>
Chord: (9, 10)

Following the steps:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more - (5, 9, 11, 10) is the only cycle of length 4.
Step 2: Check for exactly one chord - (9, 10) is the only chord in the cycle.
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found - There are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [1], as there is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph.
