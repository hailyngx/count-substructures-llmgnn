Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 8 - 7 - 1 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 4 - 5 - 14 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 5 - 7 - 1 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 4: 1 - 6 - 13 - 3 - 9 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 7 - 2 - 8 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 6: 2 - 7 - 5 - 10 - 3 - 2
- Cycle 7: 2 - 8 - 12 - 14 - 3 - 2
- Cycle 8: 3 - 9 - 10 - 11 - 12 - 14 - 3
- Cycle 9: 4 - 5 - 10 - 11 - 12 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 10: 5 - 10 - 13 - 14 - 5
- Cycle 11: 6 - 1 - 4 - 8 - 12 - 11 - 6
- Cycle 12: 9 - 3 - 14 - 13 - 6 - 1 - 9
- Cycle 13: 10 - 11 - 12 - 8 - 2 - 7 - 5 - 10
- Cycle 14: 10 - 13 - 14 - 12 - 11 - 10
- Cycle 15: 13 - 14 - 12 - 8 - 4 - 1 - 6 - 13

Now, let's identify the unique chordal 4-cycle:

- Unique chordal 4-cycle: <1, (4, 8), 7>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [1].
