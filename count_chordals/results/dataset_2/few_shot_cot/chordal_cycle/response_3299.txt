Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
1. Cycle: 0-7-1-4-0
2. Cycle: 0-7-6-2-5-0
3. Cycle: 3-4-9-8-3
4. Cycle: 4-9-8-5-4
5. Cycle: 4-9-3-5-4
6. Cycle: 5-7-6-2-5
7. Cycle: 5-7-1-4-5
8. Cycle: 6-7-1-4-6
9. Cycle: 6-7-5-8-6
10. Cycle: 6-7-5-4-6
11. Cycle: 8-9-4-5-8

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- The cycle 0-7-1-4-0 has exactly one chord: (1, 7)
- The cycle 0-7-6-2-5-0 has exactly one chord: (2, 6)
- The cycle 3-4-9-8-3 has exactly one chord: (8, 9)
- The cycle 8-9-4-5-8 has exactly one chord: (4, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 7 chordless cycles found. Therefore, the final answer is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, 7, 1, 4> with chord (1, 7)
2. <0, 7, 6, 2, 5> with chord (2, 6)
3. <3, 4, 9, 8> with chord (8, 9)
4. <8, 9, 4, 5> with chord (4, 5)
