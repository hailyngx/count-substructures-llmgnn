Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (15, 3) (15, 1) (15, 16) (11, 8) (11, 4) (7, 5) (7, 17) (12, 3) (12, 2) (12, 5) (0, 8) (0, 19) (0, 13) (0, 9) (14, 13) (5, 7) (5, 12) (5, 19) (5, 2) (19, 0) (19, 5) (19, 4) (19, 13) (1, 15) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 18) (4, 11) (4, 19) (4, 17) (2, 3) (2, 12) (2, 5) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 17) (9, 13) (18, 1) (18, 13) (16, 15) (16, 1) (16, 17) (17, 7) (17, 4) (17, 9) (17, 16) (17, 8) (8, 3) (8, 11) (8, 0) (8, 17) (13, 0) (13, 14) (13, 19) (13, 9) (13, 18) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 19, 13, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 15, 16, 9, and node 18
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 12, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 15, 2, 12, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 11, 19, and node 17
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 12, 19, and node 2
Node 6 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 17
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 11, 0, and node 17
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 1, 17, and node 13
Node 10 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 11 is connected to node 8, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 5
Node 13 is connected to node 0, 14, 19, 9, and node 18
Node 14 is connected to node 13
Node 15 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 16
Node 16 is connected to node 15, 1, and node 17
Node 17 is connected to node 7, 4, 9, 16, and node 8
Node 18 is connected to node 1, and node 13
Node 19 is connected to node 0, 5, 4, and node 13

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is: 
<3, 15, 1, 16> with the non-adjacent chord (1, 16)
 
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found in the graph is [1].
