Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <6, 9, 0, 14> (Chord: 9-14)
- There is only one chord in the cycle.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There is one chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph, which is <6, 9, 0, 14>. Therefore, the final answer is [1].
