Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 17, 10, 2, 0>
- <0, 17, 12, 7, 20, 4, 27, 23, 1, 0>
- <0, 19, 22, 9, 1, 11, 3, 4, 20, 24, 8, 0>
- <1, 11, 3, 9, 22, 19, 0, 2, 6, 27, 4, 1>
- <2, 11, 3, 9, 22, 19, 0, 8, 25, 24, 6, 2>
- <3, 11, 1, 28, 16, 5, 23, 27, 4, 3>
- <4, 27, 15, 12, 7, 20, 21, 26, 14, 13, 18, 16, 5, 29, 10, 17, 0, 4>
- <5, 16, 28, 1, 9, 22, 19, 0, 8, 3, 4, 20, 7, 12, 15, 5>
  
Next, let's identify the chordal 4-cycles (4-cycles with exactly one chord):
- <0, (17, 12), 7, 20, (4, 27), 23, 1>
- <0, (17, 12), 7, (20, 4), 27, 23, 1>
- <0, (19, 22), 9, 1, (11, 3), 4, 20, 24, 8, 0>
- <0, (19, 22), 9, 1, (11, 3), 4, 20, 24, 8, 25, 2>
- <1, (11, 3), 9, 22, 19, 0, 2, 6, (27, 4), 1>
- <2, (11, 3), 9, 22, 19, 0, 8, 25, 24, 6, 2>
- <4, (27, 15), 12, 7, 20, (21, 26), 14, 13, 18, 16, 5, 29, 10, 17, 0, 4>

Finally, let's count the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is 7. Therefore, the final answer is [7].
