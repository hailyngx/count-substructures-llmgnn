Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. Let's list them:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 3, 8>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 7, 2>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 3, 6>
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 2, 8>
- Cycle 6: <2, 5, 6, 4>
- Cycle 7: <2, 5, 4, 7>
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 4, 6>
- Cycle 9: <2, 5, 4, 6, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 11: <3, 9, 7, 2>
- Cycle 12: <3, 9, 0, 1>
- Cycle 13: <3, 9, 0, 2>
- Cycle 14: <4, 5, 6, 3>
- Cycle 15: <4, 5, 6, 0>
  
Step 2:
Checking for a single chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <3, 8>
- Cycle 2 has a chord <1, 7>
- Cycle 3 has a chord <2, 7>
- Cycle 4 has a chord <3, 6>
- Cycle 5 has a chord <1, 7>
- Cycle 6 has a chord <2, 4>
- Cycle 7 has a chord <5, 4>
- Cycle 8 has a chord <5, 4>
- Cycle 9 has multiple chords <2, 4> and <6, 3>
- Cycle 10 has a chord <1, 7>
- Cycle 11 has a chord <2, 7>
- Cycle 12 has a chord <0, 1>
- Cycle 13 has a chord <0, 2>
- Cycle 14 has a chord <4, 6>
- Cycle 15 has a chord <4, 5>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. Therefore, the final count is [11].
