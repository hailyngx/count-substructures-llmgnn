Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 1, 2, 5>: (0, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 5)
- Cycle <0, 1, 3, 5>: (0, 1), (1, 3), and (3, 5)
- Cycle <0, 3, 5, 7>: (0, 3), (3, 5), and (5, 7)
- Cycle <1, 2, 5, 7>: (1, 2), (2, 5), and (5, 7)
- Cycle <1, 3, 5, 7>: (1, 3), (3, 5), and (5, 7)
- Cycle <2, 5, 7, 9>: (2, 5), (5, 7), and (7, 9)
- Cycle <3, 5, 7, 9>: (3, 5), (5, 7), and (7, 9)
- Cycle <4, 6, 7, 5>: (4, 6), (6, 7), and (7, 5)
- Cycle <4, 6, 8, 5>: (4, 6), (6, 8), and (8, 5)
- Cycle <6, 7, 5, 2>: (6, 7), (7, 5), and (5, 2)
- Cycle <6, 8, 5, 2>: (6, 8), (8, 5), and (5, 2)
- Cycle <7, 5, 2, 1>: (7, 5), (5, 2), and (2, 1)
- Cycle <7, 5, 3, 1>: (7, 5), (5, 3), and (3, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 2, 5>: Chord (1, 5)
- <0, 1, 3, 5>: Chord (1, 3)
- <0, 3, 5, 7>: Chord (3, 5)
- <1, 3, 5, 7>: Chord (3, 5)
- <2, 5, 7, 9>: Chord (5, 7)
- <4, 6, 8, 5>: Chord (6, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = [7]
