Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 5, 3, 2, 6>
2. <0, 5, 7, 9, 1>
3. <0, 7, 5, 2, 6>
4. <0, 7, 9, 8, 6>
5. <1, 9, 8, 6, 4>
6. <2, 5, 7, 3, 4>
7. <2, 3, 7, 5, 0>
8. <3, 4, 6, 8, 9>
9. <3, 7, 9, 8, 6>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <0, 5, 3, 2, 6> has one chord: (5, 2)
2. <0, 5, 7, 9, 1> has one chord: (5, 9)
3. <0, 7, 5, 2, 6> has one chord: (7, 2)
4. <0, 7, 9, 8, 6> has one chord: (7, 8)
5. <1, 9, 8, 6, 4> has one chord: (9, 6)
6. <2, 5, 7, 3, 4> has one chord: (5, 3)
7. <2, 3, 7, 5, 0> does not have exactly one chord.
8. <3, 4, 6, 8, 9> has one chord: (4, 8)
9. <3, 7, 9, 8, 6> has one chord: (7, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <2, 3, 7, 5>.
