Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <11, 16, 4, 15> with edges (11, 16), (16, 4), (4, 15), (15, 11)
- Cycle 2: <11, 19, 10, 15> with edges (11, 19), (19, 10), (10, 15), (15, 11)
- Cycle 3: <16, 4, 15, 20> with edges (16, 4), (4, 15), (15, 20), (20, 16)
- Cycle 4: <16, 27, 10, 15> with edges (16, 27), (27, 10), (10, 15), (15, 16)
- Cycle 5: <15, 4, 28, 22> with edges (15, 4), (4, 28), (28, 22), (22, 15)
- Cycle 6: <27, 10, 19, 8> with edges (27, 10), (10, 19), (19, 8), (8, 27)
- Cycle 7: <22, 28, 21, 3> with edges (22, 28), (28, 21), (21, 3), (3, 22)
- Cycle 8: <3, 17, 22, 28> with edges (3, 17), (17, 22), (22, 28), (28, 3)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The cycle <11, 16, 4, 15> has a chord (16, 15) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- The cycle <11, 19, 10, 15> has a chord (19, 15) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- The cycle <16, 27, 10, 15> has a chord (27, 10) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- The cycle <15, 4, 28, 22> has a chord (4, 22) making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- The cycle <27, 10, 19, 8> has a chord (10, 19) making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- We found 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [5].
