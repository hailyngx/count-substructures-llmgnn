Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 7, 16, 5, 4, 3, 13, 1, 8)
- Cycle 2: (0, 7, 16, 2, 12, 9, 18, 10, 14)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 13, 3, 8, 17, 6, 14, 10)
- Cycle 4: (1, 8, 4, 7, 16, 5, 4)
- Cycle 5: (2, 16, 7, 0, 1, 8, 3, 13)
- Cycle 6: (2, 12, 9, 13, 3, 4, 8, 17)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 3, 13, 1, 0, 7, 18)
- Cycle 8: (4, 3, 13, 1, 8, 17, 6, 14)
- Cycle 9: (7, 16, 5, 4, 8, 17, 6, 14)
- Cycle 10: (14, 6, 17, 8, 4, 7, 0, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Chord <7, 8>
- Cycle 2: Chord <9, 10>
- Cycle 3: Chord <3, 13>
- Cycle 4: Chord <7, 16>
- Cycle 5: Chord <2, 12>
- Cycle 6: Chord <13, 9>
- Cycle 7: Chord <7, 18>
- Cycle 8: Chord <4, 14>
- Cycle 9: Chord <16, 5>
- Cycle 10: Chord <6, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordless 4-cycles in this graph.
