Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph. However, only some of them have exactly one chord. Let's list all of them:
1. <0, 1, 15, 3> with chord (0, 15)
2. <0, 1, 15, 12> with chord (12, 1)
3. <1, 15, 12, 16> with chord (15, 12)
4. <3, 15, 12, 16> with chord (15, 12)
5. <3, 15, 1, 0> with chord (15, 1)
6. <4, 13, 2, 5> with chord (2, 5)
7. <4, 13, 9, 7> with chord (9, 7)
8. <4, 13, 9, 16> with chord (9, 16)
9. <4, 9, 7, 19> with chord (7, 19)
10. <5, 13, 9, 7> with chord (9, 7)
11. <6, 16, 12, 15> with chord (16, 12)
12. <6, 12, 18, 10> with chord (12, 18)
13. <7, 9, 16, 6> with chord (9, 16)
14. <7, 9, 4, 13> with chord (9, 4)
15. <7, 19, 14, 10> with chord (19, 14)
16. <7, 19, 17, 10> with chord (19, 17)
17. <10, 14, 17, 19> with chord (14, 17)
18. <10, 14, 17, 19> with chord (17, 19)
19. <11, 16, 9, 13> with chord (16, 9)
20. <14, 17, 19, 7> with chord (17, 19)

Step 2:
Upon checking each cycle, we find that the following cycles have exactly one chord:
1. <0, 1, 15, 3> with chord (0, 15)
2. <0, 1, 15, 12> with chord (12, 1)
3. <3, 15, 1, 0> with chord (15, 1)
4. <4, 13, 2, 5> with chord (2, 5)
5. <4, 13, 9, 7> with chord (9, 7)
6. <4, 9, 7, 19> with chord (7, 19)
7. <6, 12, 18, 10> with chord (12, 18)
8. <10, 14, 17, 19> with chord (14, 17)

Step 3:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. Therefore, the final answer is [8].
