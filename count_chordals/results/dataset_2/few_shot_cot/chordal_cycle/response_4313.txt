Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 5, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 9, 2, 5, 0>
<0, 9, 3, 8, 0>
<0, 9, 4, 5, 0>
<0, 2, 9, 4, 0>
<0, 5, 4, 9, 0>
<1, 0, 9, 8, 1>
<1, 0, 5, 2, 1>
<2, 0, 5, 4, 2>
<2, 5, 4, 9, 2>
<3, 9, 4, 5, 3>
<3, 9, 8, 0, 3>
<4, 9, 3, 8, 4>
<4, 3, 2, 5, 4>
<5, 4, 9, 2, 5>
<6, 7, 4, 9, 6>
<7, 6, 7, 0, 7>
<8, 9, 4, 3, 8>
<8, 3, 2, 1, 8>
<9, 8, 0, 7, 9>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 9, 2, 5, 0> has chord (2, 5)
- <0, 9, 3, 8, 0> has chord (3, 8)
- <0, 9, 4, 5, 0> has chord (4, 5)
- <0, 2, 9, 4, 0> has chord (2, 4)
- <0, 5, 4, 9, 0> has chord (4, 9)
- <1, 0, 9, 8, 1> has chord (9, 8)
- <1, 0, 5, 2, 1> has chord (5, 2)
- <2, 0, 5, 4, 2> has chord (5, 4)
- <2, 5, 4, 9, 2> has chord (4, 9)
- <3, 9, 4, 5, 3> has chord (4, 5)
- <3, 9, 8, 0, 3> has chord (8, 0)
- <4, 9, 3, 8, 4> has chord (3, 8)
- <4, 3, 2, 5, 4> has chord (2, 5)
- <5, 4, 9, 2, 5> has chord (9, 2)
- <6, 7, 4, 9, 6> has chord (4, 9)
- <7, 6, 7, 0, 7> has chord (7, 0)
- <8, 9, 4, 3, 8> has chord (4, 3)
- <8, 3, 2, 1, 8> has chord (2, 1)
- <9, 8, 0, 7, 9> has chord (0, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 18 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [18].
