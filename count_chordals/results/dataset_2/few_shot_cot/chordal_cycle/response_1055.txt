Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- <0, 6, 1, 19, 0>
- <0, 4, 7, 11, 8, 15, 19, 1, 12, 0>
- <0, 4, 7, 11, 14, 11, 7, 17, 9, 6, 0>
- <0, 4, 16, 9, 6, 1, 19, 15, 8, 11, 7, 4, 0>
- <0, 4, 16, 18, 0>
- <0, 12, 1, 19, 15, 8, 11, 7, 4, 16, 2, 3, 5, 12, 0>
- <0, 18, 16, 9, 17, 7, 4, 0>
- <1, 19, 15, 5, 3, 2, 16, 4, 7, 11, 8, 9, 6, 0>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 16, 9, 6, 1, 19, 15, 8, 11, 7, 4, 0> has a chord 9-16
- <0, 12, 1, 19, 15, 8, 11, 7, 4, 16, 2, 3, 5, 12, 0> has a chord 7-16

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
Only one chordless cycle is found, so the count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, 6, 1, 19, 0>
