Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 4, 2, 10> 
- <0, 4, 2, 9> 
- <0, 4, 2, 1> 
- <0, 8, 2, 10> 
- <0, 8, 2, 4> 
- <0, 8, 2, 9> 
- <0, 8, 2, 1> 
- <0, 8, 9, 10> 
- <0, 8, 9, 2> 
- <0, 8, 9, 14> 
- <0, 8, 14, 6> 
- <0, 8, 14, 9> 
- <0, 7, 1, 11> 
- <0, 7, 1, 5> 
- <0, 7, 1, 2> 
- <0, 7, 1, 4> 
- <0, 7, 1, 0> 
- <0, 7, 8, 2> 
- <0, 7, 8, 14> 
- <0, 7, 8, 9> 
- <0, 7, 8, 0> 
- <0, 7, 4, 1> 
- <0, 7, 4, 2> 
- <0, 7, 8, 9> 
- <0, 7, 4, 8> 
- <0, 1, 7, 4> 
- <0, 1, 7, 8> 
- <0, 1, 7, 8> 
- <0, 1, 7, 8> 
- <0, 1, 7, 8> 

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 2, 10> has a chord 2 - (0, 4, 10, 2)

- <0, 4, 2, 1> has a chord 1 - (0, 2, 1, 4)
- <0, 8, 2, 10> has a chord 8 - (0, 2, 10, 8)
- <0, 8, 2, 4> has a chord 2 - (0, 8, 4, 2)
- <0, 8, 2, 9> has a chord 8 - (0, 2, 9, 8)
- <0, 8, 2, 1> has a chord 2 - (0, 8, 1, 2)
- <0, 8, 9, 10> has a chord 9 - (0, 10, 8, 9)
- <0, 8, 9, 2> has a chord 9 - (0, 8, 2, 9)

- <0, 7, 1, 5> has a chord 7 - (0, 1, 5, 7)
- <0, 7, 1, 2> has a chord 1 - (0, 1, 2, 7)
- <0, 7, 1, 4> has a chord 7 - (0, 1, 4, 7)
- <0, 7, 1, 0> has a chord 7 - (0, 1, 7, 0)
- <0, 7, 8, 2> has a chord 7 - (0, 8, 2, 7)
- <0, 7, 8, 14> has a chord 7 - (0, 8, 14, 7)
- <0, 7, 8, 9> has a chord 7 - (0, 8, 9, 7)
- <0, 7, 8, 0> has a chord 8 - (0, 8, 0, 7)
- <0, 7, 4, 1> has a chord 7 - (0, 4, 1, 7)
