Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<0, 6, 1, 5>  
<0, 6, 3, 8>  
<0, 6, 5, 1>  
<0, 2, 4, 5>  
<0, 2, 8, 6>  
<0, 3, 8, 6>  
<1, 5, 9, 7>  
<1, 6, 8, 3>  
<1, 7, 5, 9>  
<2, 4, 5, 9>  
<2, 8, 6, 5>  
<2, 9, 5, 1>  
<3, 6, 8, 9>  
<3, 8, 2, 9>  
<4, 2, 8, 6>  
<5, 7, 9, 1>  

Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle found:

<0, 6, 1, 5> has a chord (6, 1)  
<0, 6, 3, 8> has a chord (6, 8)  
<0, 2, 4, 5> has a chord (2, 5)  
<0, 2, 8, 6> has a chord (2, 8)  
<0, 3, 8, 6> has a chord (3, 6)  
<2, 4, 5, 9> has a chord (4, 9)  
<2, 8, 6, 5> has a chord (8, 5)  
<3, 6, 8, 9> has a chord (6, 9)  

Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
