Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <11, 16, 2, 25> has chord (16, 25)
- <11, 29, 24, 20> has chord (29, 20)
- <11, 29, 24, 21> has chord (29, 21)
- <16, 15, 19, 25> has chord (15, 25)
- <16, 15, 19, 26> has chord (15, 26)
- <15, 27, 13, 23> has chord (27, 23)
- <20, 25, 5, 12> has chord (25, 12)
- <24, 20, 2, 11> has chord (20, 11)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal cycles found:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [7].
