Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <3, 15, 12, 6, 13, 3>
- Cycle 2: <4, 9, 1, 17, 7, 4>
- Cycle 3: <4, 9, 15, 12, 6, 4>
- Cycle 4: <4, 13, 18, 11, 5, 19, 7, 4>
- Cycle 5: <4, 13, 2, 14, 2, 13, 6, 12, 8, 16, 10, 9, 4>
- Cycle 6: <4, 13, 3, 15, 9, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (12, 15)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (11, 17)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (2, 6)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (13, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<3, (15, 12), 6, 13>
<4, (9, 1), 17, 7>
<4, (15, 12), 6, 9>
<4, (13, 2), 14, 13>
<4, (9, 15), 3, 13>
<4, (11, 17), 7, 13>
