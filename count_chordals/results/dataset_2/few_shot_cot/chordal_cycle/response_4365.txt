Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: (3, 28, 0, 26), chord: (28, 26)
- Cycle 2: (3, 29, 17, 9), chord: (29, 9)
- Cycle 3: (3, 19, 11, 1), chord: (19, 1)
- Cycle 4: (4, 15, 24, 16), chord: (15, 24)
- Cycle 5: (4, 15, 24, 22), chord: (15, 22)
- Cycle 6: (4, 24, 16, 2), chord: (16, 2)
- Cycle 7: (4, 12, 20, 19), chord: (12, 19)
- Cycle 8: (6, 21, 23, 0), chord: (21, 0)
- Cycle 9: (6, 13, 25, 7), chord: (13, 7)
- Cycle 10: (9, 17, 29, 3), chord: (17, 3)
- Cycle 11: (9, 17, 29, 28), chord: (17, 28)
- Cycle 12: (9, 17, 29, 3), chord: (17, 3)
- Cycle 13: (9, 1, 11, 19), chord: (1, 19)
- Cycle 14: (9, 1, 11, 8), chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 15: (12, 20, 19, 3), chord: (20, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, 28, 0, 26> has a chord (28, 26)
- <3, 29, 17, 9> has a chord (29, 9)
- <3, 19, 11, 1> has a chord (19, 1)
- <4, 15, 24, 16> has a chord (15, 24)
- <6, 21, 23, 0> has a chord (21, 0)
- <6, 13, 25, 7> has a chord (13, 7)
- <9, 1, 11, 19> has a chord (1, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [8]
