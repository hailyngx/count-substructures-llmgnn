Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The list of cycles is as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 19, 9, 2, 5, 17, 14, 12, 3, 7, 4, 13>
- Cycle 2: <1, 13, 0, 19, 6, 19, 11, 15, 10, 17, 18, 14>
- Cycle 3: <2, 9, 19, 0, 13, 4, 16, 1>
- Cycle 4: <3, 8, 15, 14, 17, 5, 3>
- Cycle 5: <5, 17, 18, 14, 12, 3, 5>
- Cycle 6: <7, 9, 19, 11, 15, 8, 3, 7>
- Cycle 7: <8, 12, 14, 17, 10, 15, 8>
- Cycle 8: <10, 17, 14, 12, 8, 15, 10>
- Cycle 9: <11, 15, 10, 17, 14, 12, 8, 3, 5, 2, 9, 19>
- Cycle 10: <12, 14, 17, 10, 15, 11, 19, 0, 13, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle 11: <13, 0, 19, 11, 15, 14, 17, 10, 9, 7, 4, 16>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
<1, 13, 4, 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [10] chordless cycles found.
