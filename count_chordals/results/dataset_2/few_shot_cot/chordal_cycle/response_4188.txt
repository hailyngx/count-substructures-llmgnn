Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles with 4 or more nodes:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 1 - 6 - 4 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 2: 1 - 3 - 2 - 8 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 3: 4 - 8 - 3 - 2 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 4: 2 - 3 - 1 - 5 - 9 - 2
- Cycle 5: 3 - 8 - 4 - 6 - 1 - 3
- Cycle 6: 8 - 2 - 7 - 5 - 9 - 8
- Cycle 7: 6 - 4 - 1 - 5 - 2 - 6
- Cycle 8: 7 - 5 - 9 - 4 - 6 - 7
- Cycle 9: 4 - 1 - 5 - 0 - 2 - 4
- Cycle 10: 5 - 6 - 7 - 2 - 3 - 5

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (3, 2)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (3, 5)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (2, 9)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (3, 1)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (2, 5)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (4, 2)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (4, 5)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (6, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. Thus, the final count is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (1, 4), 6)>
<2, (3, 2), 8)>
<3, (3, 5), 4)>
<4, (2, 9), 5)>
<5, (3, 1), 2)>
<6, (2, 5), 6)>
<7, (4, 2), 5)>
<8, (4, 5), 7)>
<9, (1, 5), 0)>
<10, (6, 7), 5)>
