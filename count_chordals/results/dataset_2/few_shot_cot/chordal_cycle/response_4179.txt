Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <8, 13, 1, 10>, with the chord being edge (1, 10).

Following the steps provided:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <8, 13, 1, 10, 2>
- Cycle 2: <8, 13, 6, 1, 10>
- Cycle 3: <8, 13, 6, 1, 10, 9>
- Cycle 4: <8, 13, 0, 14, 7>
- Cycle 5: <8, 13, 1, 10, 9>
- Cycle 6: <8, 19, 17, 15, 4>
- Cycle 7: <13, 1, 10, 9, 15>
- Cycle 8: <13, 0, 14, 7, 12>
- Cycle 9: <13, 1, 10, 9, 15, 17>
- Cycle 10: <13, 1, 10, 9, 15, 4>
- Cycle 11: <13, 0, 14, 7, 12, 17>
- Cycle 12: <0, 14, 7, 12, 17, 15>
- Cycle 13: <14, 7, 12, 17, 15, 4>
- Cycle 14: <2, 8, 13, 1, 10>
- Cycle 15: <2, 8, 13, 1, 10, 9>
- Cycle 16: <2, 8, 13, 0, 14>
- Cycle 17: <2, 8, 19, 17, 15>
- Cycle 18: <2, 8, 19, 17, 15, 4>
- Cycle 19: <2, 4, 16, 15, 17>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Among the listed cycles, only cycle <8, 13, 1, 10> has one chord (1, 10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
Since only one chordal 4-cycle was found, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
