Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <0, (4, 12), 17, 10>
        - Cycle 2: <0, (9, 16), 15, 7>
        - Cycle 3: <1, (5, 7), 15, 6>
        - Cycle 4: <1, (8, 19), 6, 15>
        - Cycle 5: <1, (13, 9), 16, 12>
        - Cycle 6: <1, (8, 14), 8, 3>
        - Cycle 7: <2, (11, 4), 12, 17>
        - Cycle 8: <4, (0, 9), 13, 1>
        - Cycle 9: <5, (1, 3), 15, 16>
        - Cycle 10: <6, (15, 16), 9, 13>
        - Cycle 11: <7, (15, 6), 1, 5>
        - Cycle 12: <8, (3, 1), 5, 7>
        - Cycle 13: <10, (17, 12), 4, 0>
        - Cycle 14: <11, (2, 10), 16, 9>
        - Cycle 15: <12, (4, 0), 19, 8>
        - Cycle 16: <13, (1, 8), 19, 6>
        - Cycle 17: <14, (8, 19), 0, 4>
        - Cycle 18: <16, (9, 0), 18, 17>
        - Cycle 19: <17, (12, 16), 15, 6>
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - <1, (13, 9), 16, 12> has exactly one chord (13, 9)
        - <4, (0, 9), 13, 1> has exactly one chord (0, 9)
        - <10, (17, 12), 4, 0> has exactly one chord (17, 12)
        - <17, (12, 16), 15, 6> has exactly one chord (12, 16)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [4].
