Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <6, 9, 8, 6>
- <6, 9, 3, 6>
- <6, 8, 4, 5, 6>
- <6, 5, 4, 8, 6>
- <9, 6, 5, 7, 9>
- <9, 6, 3, 2, 9>
- <9, 8, 4, 5, 9>
- <9, 8, 7, 5, 9>
- <1, 7, 5, 2, 1>
- <3, 6, 9, 8, 3>
- <3, 6, 5, 7, 3>
- <3, 9, 8, 7, 3>
- <4, 8, 6, 0, 4>
- <4, 8, 2, 7, 4>
- <4, 5, 7, 2, 4>
- <5, 6, 9, 8, 5>
- <5, 6, 3, 7, 5>
- <5, 4, 8, 7, 5>
- <8, 6, 3, 5, 8>
- <8, 9, 6, 0, 8>
- <8, 9, 3, 2, 8>
- <8, 4, 5, 7, 8>
- <8, 4, 2, 5, 8>
- <8, 0, 6, 9, 8>
- <8, 0, 7, 5, 8>
- <7, 1, 5, 2, 7>
- <7, 8, 9, 6, 7>
- <7, 8, 4, 5, 7>
  
Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- <6, 9, 8, 6> (Chord: (9, 8))
- <9, 6, 5, 7, 9> (Chord: (6, 5))
- <1, 7, 5, 2, 1> (Chord: (7, 5))
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- [25]
