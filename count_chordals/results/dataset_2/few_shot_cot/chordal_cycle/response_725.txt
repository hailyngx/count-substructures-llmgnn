Response:
The given graph has multiple chordal 4-cycles. Let's go through the process step by step:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (1, 17, 25, 27, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 17, 9, 16, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 13, 6, 4, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 13, 19, 7, 1)
- Cycle 5: (2, 23, 0, 11, 2)
- Cycle 6: (3, 8, 24, 20, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 2, 23, 12, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 13, 19, 7, 3)
- Cycle 9: (4, 6, 13, 19, 4)
- Cycle 10: (5, 7, 29, 15, 5)
- Cycle 11: (6, 25, 27, 12, 6)
- Cycle 12: (6, 14, 26, 12, 6)
- Cycle 13: (6, 10, 8, 24, 6)
- Cycle 14: (7, 5, 29, 15, 7)
- Cycle 15: (9, 21, 16, 28, 9)
- Cycle 16: (9, 4, 7, 29, 9)
- Cycle 17: (10, 28, 24, 8, 10)
- Cycle 18: (11, 27, 25, 17, 11)
- Cycle 19: (13, 6, 25, 17, 13)
- Cycle 20: (15, 17, 25, 27, 15)
- Cycle 21: (15, 29, 7, 4, 15)
- Cycle 22: (16, 21, 9, 17, 16)
- Cycle 23: (22, 28, 24, 8, 22)

Step 2: Cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <10, (8, 24), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, (25, 12), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <16, (9, 17), 15>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <16, (28, 8), 24>

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles found = [19]

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [4].
