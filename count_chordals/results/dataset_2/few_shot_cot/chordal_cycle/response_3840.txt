Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<0, 7, 13, 17>
<0, 7, 15, 17>
<0, 15, 17, 13>
<5, 9, 19, 17>
<5, 2, 13, 9>
<5, 2, 14, 3>
<5, 2, 10, 9>
<9, 19, 18, 4>
<9, 19, 17, 13>
<9, 19, 17, 15>
<4, 18, 19, 17>
<4, 18, 19, 3>
<7, 0, 15, 17>
<7, 0, 15, 17>
<7, 0, 15, 17>
<7, 0, 15, 17>
<14, 3, 8, 10>
<14, 3, 19, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<0, 7, 13, 17> - Chord: (7, 13)
<5, 9, 19, 17> - Chord: (9, 17)
<5, 2, 10, 9> - Chord: (2, 9)
<9, 19, 18, 4> - Chord: (19, 4)
<7, 0, 15, 17> - Chord: (0, 15)
<14, 3, 8, 10> - Chord: (3, 8)
<13, 9, 5, 1> - Chord: (9, 5)
<17, 13, 2, 5> - Chord: (13, 5)
<10, 8, 11, 4> - Chord: (8, 11)
<11, 5, 2, 14> - Chord: (5, 14)
<12, 8, 10, 2> - Chord: (8, 10)
<19, 9, 5, 2> - Chord: (9, 5)
<15, 0, 7, 13> - Chord: (7, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 7, 15, 17>
