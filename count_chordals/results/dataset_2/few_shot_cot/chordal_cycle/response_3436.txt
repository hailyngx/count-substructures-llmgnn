Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (11, 1) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 10) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 4) (14, 0) (14, 12) (14, 2) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 0) (4, 12) (12, 8) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 4) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 2) (2, 13) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, 14, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 11, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 13, 6, 14, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 13, 10, 11, 0, and node 12
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 10, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 10, 11, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 13, 0, 6, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 11, 6, 7, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 10, 7, 12, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 11, 14, and node 4
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 2
Node 14 is connected to node 0, 12, and node 2

Response:
There are <0, 1, 6, 5>, <4, 0, 1, 6>, <4, 0, 8, 6>, <4, 0, 1, 11>, <4, 0, 14, 12>, <4, 11, 12, 8>, and <2, 13, 4, 11> chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. 
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
