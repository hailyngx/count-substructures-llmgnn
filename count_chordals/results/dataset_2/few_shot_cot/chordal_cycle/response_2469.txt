Response:
Step 1: 
From the given graph, we can find the following cycles of length 4:
1. <1, 2, 3, 10>
2. <1, 2, 0, 18>
3. <1, 10, 3, 16>
4. <1, 18, 0, 7>
5. <3, 10, 17, 6>
6. <3, 10, 15, 13>
7. <3, 16, 13, 15>
8. <10, 17, 6, 5>
9. <10, 15, 7, 18>
10. <13, 8, 13, 15>
11. <15, 7, 18, 14>
12. <0, 2, 1, 10>
13. <0, 18, 7, 11>
14. <2, 1, 10, 3>
15. <2, 3, 16, 13>
16. <7, 11, 19, 4>
17. <7, 14, 6, 17>
18. <7, 18, 14, 6>
19. <11, 4, 9, 11>
20. <11, 9, 4, 19>
21. <4, 19, 11, 7>
22. <6, 17, 10, 3>
23. <6, 5, 16, 3>
24. <8, 13, 16, 3>
25. <13, 15, 12, 3>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find that the following cycles are chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, 2, 3, 10>, chord: (2, 10)
2. <1, 2, 0, 18>, chord: (2, 18)
3. <1, 10, 3, 16>, chord: (10, 16)
4. <1, 18, 0, 7>, chord: (18, 7)
5. <10, 15, 7, 18>, chord: (15, 7)
6. <13, 8, 13, 15>, chord: (8, 15)
7. <15, 7, 18, 14>, chord: (7, 18)
8. <6, 5, 16, 3>, chord: (5, 16)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, in this case, we found 0 chordless cycles.
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
