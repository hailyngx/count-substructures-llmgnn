Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 12) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 12) (6, 13) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 11) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (12, 0) (12, 11) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 10) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 14) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 11) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 9) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (14, 13) (14, 1) (14, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 12, 2, 10, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 11, and node 14
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 1

Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 10, 11, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 12, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 12, and node 11
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 10, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 10, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 0, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 7, 12, 3, and node 1
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 13, 0, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 12, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 13, 1, and node 10

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is as follows:

<5, (6, 13), 12, (7, 11)> 

Now, we will count the number of chordless cycles found in the graph.

The number of chordless cycles found is [13].
