Step 2:
We will now check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <13, 22, 8, 9> (Chord: 22)
2. <13, 22, 21, 9> (Chord: 9)
3. <13, 22, 10, 1> (Chord: 1)
4. <13, 15, 8, 9> (Chord: 8)
5. <13, 26, 0, 4> (Chord: 0)
6. <13, 26, 18, 7> (Chord: 7)
7. <22, 8, 15, 13> (Chord: 15)
8. <22, 21, 9, 5> (Chord: 21)
9. <1, 7, 18, 26> (Chord: 18)
10. <1, 19, 11, 2> (Chord: 11)
11. <10, 14, 16, 25> (Chord: 16)
12. <10, 21, 9, 5> (Chord: 9)
