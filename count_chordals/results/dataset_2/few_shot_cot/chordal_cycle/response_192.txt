Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <0, (2, 16), 25, 10)>.
  
To count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph, we follow the steps:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- We find the following cycles: 
  - Cycle 1: 0 - 22 - 7 - 15 - 0
  - Cycle 2: 1 - 7 - 15 - 11 - 1
  - Cycle 3: 2 - 18 - 0 - 22 - 2
  - Cycle 4: 3 - 1 - 7 - 22 - 3
  - Cycle 5: 4 - 23 - 12 - 18 - 4
  - Cycle 6: 5 - 17 - 13 - 27 - 5
  - Cycle 7: 6 - 3 - 1 - 7 - 6
  - Cycle 8: 8 - 11 - 15 - 7 - 8
  - Cycle 9: 9 - 1 - 7 - 22 - 9
  - Cycle 10: 10 - 21 - 7 - 16 - 10
  - Cycle 11: 11 - 14 - 1 - 9 - 11
  - Cycle 12: 12 - 18 - 2 - 26 - 12
  - Cycle 13: 13 - 17 - 5 - 0 - 13
  - Cycle 14: 14 - 28 - 20 - 29 - 14
  - Cycle 15: 15 - 26 - 2 - 16 - 15
  - Cycle 16: 16 - 25 - 10 - 21 - 16
  - Cycle 17: 17 - 6 - 29 - 20 - 17
  - Cycle 18: 18 - 12 - 23 - 4 - 18
  - Cycle 19: 20 - 8 - 11 - 14 - 20
  - Cycle 20: 21 - 10 - 25 - 16 - 21
  - Cycle 21: 22 - 0 - 18 - 12 - 22
  - Cycle 22: 23 - 4 - 20 - 28 - 23
  - Cycle 23: 24 - 0 - 18 - 12 - 24
  - Cycle 24: 25 - 10 - 21 - 7 - 25
  - Cycle 25: 26 - 2 - 18 - 12 - 26
  - Cycle 26: 27 - 13 - 17 - 5 - 27
  - Cycle 27: 28 - 14 - 1 - 3 - 28
  - Cycle 28: 29 - 6 - 3 - 1 - 29

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The only cycle with one chord is <0, (2, 16), 25, 10)>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.
- There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
