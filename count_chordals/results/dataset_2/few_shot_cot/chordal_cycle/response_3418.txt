Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 5, 8>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 9>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 3, 6>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 2, 9>
- Cycle 5: <1, 3, 6, 9>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 7: <1, 7, 9, 8>
- Cycle 8: <1, 7, 6, 3>
- Cycle 9: <2, 3, 6, 9>
- Cycle 10: <2, 4, 7, 1>
- Cycle 11: <2, 4, 5, 8>
- Cycle 12: <2, 4, 3, 1>
- Cycle 13: <3, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 14: <3, 4, 0, 1>
- Cycle 15: <3, 4, 2, 9>
- Cycle 16: <3, 6, 7, 9>
- Cycle 17: <4, 7, 1, 3>
- Cycle 18: <4, 7, 9, 6>
- Cycle 19: <5, 8, 9, 7>
- Cycle 20: <6, 9, 2, 4>
- Cycle 21: <6, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 22: <7, 9, 6, 3>
- Cycle 23: <7, 9, 2, 4>

Step 2: Checking for one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 5, 8>, Chord: (4, 5)
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 9>, Chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 6, 9>, Chord: (3, 6)
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 4, 5>, Chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 5: <2, 3, 6, 9>, Chord: (3, 6)
- Cycle 6: <2, 4, 7, 1>, Chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 7: <3, 4, 7, 5>, Chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 8: <6, 9, 2, 4>, Chord: (2, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordless cycles = [0]
