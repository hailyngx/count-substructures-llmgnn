Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 10) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (13, 8) (13, 3) (13, 1) (13, 14) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 11) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 10) (6, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (12, 7) (12, 5) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 1) (0, 9) (14, 13) (3, 13) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 9) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 9) (10, 4) (10, 6) (10, 0) (10, 1) (9, 4) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) (9, 11) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 0) (1, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 13, 0, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 13, 5, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 6, 2, 12, 11, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 10, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 12, 11, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 13, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 12, 0, 3, and node 11
Node 10 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 3, 1, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 13

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
<4, 7, 11, 5> with chord (7, 5)
<4, 7, 6, 10> with chord (7, 10)
<4, 7, 6, 5> with chord (7, 6)
<4, 9, 12, 5> with chord (9, 5)

These are all the chordal 4-cycles in the graph. Thus, the final count is [4].
