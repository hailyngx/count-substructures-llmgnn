Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 4 - 1 - 9
- Cycle 3: 5 - 3 - 1 - 9
- Cycle 4: 5 - 7 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 5: 3 - 1 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 6: 1 - 2 - 8 - 9
- Cycle 7: 1 - 8 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 8: 1 - 4 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 9: 9 - 0 - 3 - 5
- Cycle 10: 9 - 8 - 6 - 5

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has the chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 2 has the chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 3 has the chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 4 has the chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 5 has the chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 6 has the chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 7 has the chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 8 has the chord (4, 5)
- Cycle 9 has the chord (0, 3)
- Cycle 10 has the chord (8, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 2.
Therefore, the final count is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<1, (2, 8), 9)>
