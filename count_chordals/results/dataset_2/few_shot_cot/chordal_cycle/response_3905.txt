Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <1, 6, 5, 2>
- <1, 6, 7, 9>
- <2, 5, 6, 12>
- <2, 11, 8, 9>
- <2, 12, 6, 7>
- <4, 13, 7, 6>
- <4, 13, 15, 18>
- <4, 16, 14, 3>
- <9, 7, 13, 15>
- <10, 1, 6, 7>
- <10, 1, 19, 17>
- <10, 18, 9, 8>
- <10, 18, 15, 13>
- <12, 6, 7, 13>
- <13, 2, 11, 8>
- <14, 0, 3, 14>
- <14, 0, 16, 4>
- <14, 3, 16, 4>
- <14, 16, 18, 9>
- <15, 13, 7, 9>
- <17, 14, 3, 16>
- <17, 14, 16, 18>
- <17, 19, 8, 11>
- <18, 9, 8, 19>
- <19, 8, 11, 2>
- <19, 8, 9, 18>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord:
- From the listed cycles, we have the following chordal 4-cycle:
    <14, 0, 16, 4> with chord (0, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 25.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
