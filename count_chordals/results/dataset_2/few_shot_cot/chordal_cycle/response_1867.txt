Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 11 - 9 - 6 - 2 - 11
- Cycle 2: 11 - 8 - 4 - 16 - 11
- Cycle 3: 6 - 9 - 11 - 8 - 6
- Cycle 4: 6 - 3 - 1 - 13 - 7 - 17 - 5 - 15 - 12 - 0 - 4 - 16 - 10 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 5: 2 - 6 - 3 - 19 - 12 - 15 - 14 - 18 - 6
- Cycle 6: 3 - 1 - 13 - 7 - 14 - 18 - 6 - 2 - 19 - 17 - 5 - 12 - 15 - 7 - 17 - 19 - 3
- Cycle 7: 4 - 16 - 10 - 3 - 6 - 9 - 12 - 5 - 17 - 7 - 13 - 1 - 3 - 10 - 16 - 4
- Cycle 8: 8 - 4 - 0 - 12 - 15 - 5 - 17 - 19 - 3 - 10 - 16 - 4 - 8
- Cycle 9: 17 - 19 - 3 - 10 - 16 - 4 - 0 - 12 - 15 - 14 - 7 - 13 - 1 - 3 - 19

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (6, 2), 11>
- <2, (8, 4), 16>
- <3, (11, 8), 9>
- <4, (6, 9), 11>
- <5, (12, 15), 6>
- <6, (1, 13), 7>
- <7, (3, 10), 16>
- <8, (4, 0), 12>
- <9, (17, 5), 19>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 9 chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [9].
