Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 0, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles with 4 or more nodes:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 8, 5, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 4, 6, 2>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 1, 7, 2>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 4, 9, 8>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 6, 2, 7>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 2, 8, 5>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 4, 9, 8>
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 8, 9, 0>
- Cycle 9: <4, 6, 2, 7, 1>

Step 2: Check for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 8, 5, 1> has chord (8, 1)
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 4, 6, 2> has chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 1, 7, 2> has chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 4, 9, 8> has chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 6, 2, 7> does not contain a chord
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 2, 8, 5> has chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 4, 9, 8> has chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 8, 9, 0> has chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 9: <4, 6, 2, 7, 1> does not contain a chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final count is [6].
