Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (3, 6, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (3, 6, 12, 1)
- Cycle 3: (3, 8, 4, 13)
- Cycle 4: (3, 8, 18, 14)
- Cycle 5: (5, 1, 12, 6)
- Cycle 6: (5, 1, 7, 17)
- Cycle 7: (5, 1, 12, 18)
- Cycle 8: (6, 3, 9, 16)
- Cycle 9: (6, 3, 8, 18)
- Cycle 10: (6, 5, 17, 16)
- Cycle 11: (6, 8, 18, 14)
- Cycle 12: (8, 3, 9, 16)
- Cycle 13: (8, 3, 6, 12)
- Cycle 14: (8, 4, 13, 0)
- Cycle 15: (8, 4, 13, 10)
- Cycle 16: (8, 18, 14, 15)
- Cycle 17: (8, 18, 14, 5)
- Cycle 18: (9, 3, 6, 12)
- Cycle 19: (9, 16, 17, 7)
- Cycle 20: (9, 16, 17, 19)
- Cycle 21: (17, 16, 18, 14)
- Cycle 22: (17, 16, 18, 10)
- Cycle 23: (17, 16, 18, 12)

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- <3, (6, 5), 1>
- <3, (6, 12), 1>
- <3, (8, 4), 13>
- <5, (1, 7), 17>
- <6, (3, 9), 16>
- <8, (4, 13), 0>
- <17, (16, 18), 14>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [16].
