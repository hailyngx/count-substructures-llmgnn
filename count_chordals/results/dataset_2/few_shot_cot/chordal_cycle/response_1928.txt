- Cycle 3: <5, 1, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 8, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 5: <9, 5, 1, 6, 9>
- Cycle 6: <9, 5, 8, 4, 9>
- Cycle 7: <9, 8, 7, 4, 9>
- Cycle 8: <9, 8, 5, 1, 9>
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 1, 6, 4>
- Cycle 10: <4, 7, 8, 5, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 8, 7, 1, 4>

- Cycle 34: <2, 4, 7, 1, 2>
- Cycle 35: <2, 4, 8, 5, 2>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 3, 6, 5>, Chord: (5, 3) 
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, 7, 1, 6, 4>, Chord: (7, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, 8, 7, 1, 4>, Chord: (8, 1)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found = [32]
