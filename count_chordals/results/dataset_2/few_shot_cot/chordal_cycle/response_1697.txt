Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 10) (6, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 1) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 2) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 6) (5, 1) (0, 4) (0, 10) (0, 14) (0, 1) (14, 6) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (14, 8) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 12) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 2) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 13) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 10) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 13) (3, 6) (13, 1) (13, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 14, 10, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 10, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 14, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 14, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 7, 11, 0, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 10, 14, 8, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 4, 11, 8, and node 2
Node 13 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 9, 11, 0, and node 8

Response:
There are four unique chordal 4-cycles identified in the given graph. The chordal 4-cycles and the number of non-adjacent chords in each are as follows:

1. <1, 7, 10, 6> [1]
2. <1, (2, 13), 7, (10, 2)> [2]
3. <4, (11, 12), 8, 14> [1]
4. <4, (11, 12), 8, 9> [1]

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
