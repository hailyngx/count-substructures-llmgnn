Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 5, 2>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 3, 9>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 1, 8>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 8, 12>
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 10, 12>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 9, 3>
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 14, 0>
- Cycle 8: <1, 8, 12, 10>
- Cycle 9: <2, 5, 13, 11>
- Cycle 10: <3, 4, 9, 7>
- Cycle 11: <3, 4, 14, 1>
- Cycle 12: <4, 5, 13, 7>
- Cycle 13: <6, 8, 12, 10>
- Cycle 14: <6, 7, 13, 11>
- Cycle 15: <7, 9, 4, 1>
- Cycle 16: <8, 1, 4, 0>
- Cycle 17: <11, 2, 5, 13>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 8> (Chord: (4, 8))
- Chordal Cycle 2: <3, 4, 9, 7> (Chord: (4, 9))
- Chordal Cycle 3: <6, 7, 13, 11> (Chord: (7, 13))
- Chordal Cycle 4: <7, 9, 4, 1> (Chord: (9, 4))

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [13].
