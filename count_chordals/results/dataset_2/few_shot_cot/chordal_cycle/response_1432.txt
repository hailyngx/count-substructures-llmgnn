Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 9, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 4, 9> (of length 4)
- Cycle 2: <1, 9, 4, 8> (of length 4)
- Cycle 3: <2, 1, 4, 5> (of length 4)
- Cycle 4: <3, 7, 4, 8> (of length 4)
- Cycle 5: <6, 7, 4, 9> (of length 4)
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 6, 2, 5> (of length 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 (0, 7, 4, 9) has a chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 2 (1, 9, 4, 8) has a chord (9, 8)
- Cycle 3 (2, 1, 4, 5) is chordal with chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 4 (3, 7, 4, 8) has a chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 5 (6, 7, 4, 9) has a chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 6 (1, 9, 6, 2, 5) does not have exactly one chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [5]. The unique chordal 4-cycles are listed below:
- <0, 7, 4, 9> with chord (7, 9)
- <1, 9, 4, 8> with chord (9, 8)
- <2, 1, 4, 5> with chord (1, 5)
- <3, 7, 4, 8> with chord (7, 8)
- <6, 7, 4, 9> with chord (7, 9)
