Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

    - <0, 9, 8, 11> 
    - <0, 9, 4, 7> 
    - <0, 9, 2, 12> 
    - <0, 11, 14, 7> 
    - <1, 5, 7, 3> 
    - <1, 5, 11, 8> 
    - <1, 6, 12, 14> 
    - <1, 13, 7, 3> 
    - <2, 4, 7, 3> 
    - <2, 12, 6, 1> 
    - <2, 9, 4, 7> 
    - <3, 7, 14, 11> 
    - <3, 13, 1, 6> 
    - <4, 9, 8, 11> 
    - <4, 9, 2, 12> 
    - <5, 1, 6, 10> 
    - <5, 7, 4, 9> 
    - <6, 1, 14, 11> 
    - <7, 4, 2, 12> 
    - <7, 5, 11, 8> 
    - <10, 6, 12, 2> 
    - <11, 8, 9, 0> 
    - <12, 2, 4, 9> 
    - <13, 1, 6, 10> 
    - <14, 7, 4, 9> 

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:

    - <0, 9, 8, 11> -- Chord: (9, 8) 
    - <0, 9, 4, 7> -- Chord: (9, 4) 
    - <0, 9, 2, 12> -- Chord: (9, 12) 
    - <1, 5, 7, 3> -- Chord: (5, 3) 
    - <1, 6, 12, 14> -- Chord: (6, 12) 
    - <2, 4, 7, 3> -- Chord: (4, 7) 
    - <3, 7, 14, 11> -- Chord: (7, 11) 
    - <10, 6, 12, 2> -- Chord: (6, 12) 

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

The number of chordal 4-cycles is [8].
