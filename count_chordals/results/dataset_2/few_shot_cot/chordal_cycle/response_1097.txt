Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, but we are specifically interested in 4-cycles. Let's list down the 4-cycles:

1. Cycle <0, 5, 6, 3>
2. Cycle <0, 5, 9, 6>
3. Cycle <0, 5, 9, 2>
4. Cycle <0, 5, 3, 7>
5. Cycle <0, 2, 4, 7>
6. Cycle <0, 2, 4, 3>
7. Cycle <0, 3, 7, 4>
8. Cycle <1, 9, 5, 6>
9. Cycle <1, 9, 2, 4>
10. Cycle <3, 5, 9, 6>
11. Cycle <3, 5, 6, 4>
12. Cycle <3, 4, 7, 6>
13. Cycle <4, 7, 6, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Out of the listed cycles, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 2, 4, 7> with a chord 2 and 4

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle in the given graph, so the count is [1]. 

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 2, 4, 7>.
