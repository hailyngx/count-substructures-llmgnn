Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Enumerating cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 6, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 9, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 6, 4, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 6, 4, 1, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 6, 7, 8, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 9, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 8: <3, 9, 6, 2, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 5, 8, 1> has a chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 7: <3, 9, 5, 8, 3> has a chord (5, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 9, 5, 8, 1>
- <3, 9, 5, 8, 3>
