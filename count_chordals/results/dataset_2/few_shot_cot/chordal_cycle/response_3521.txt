Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 4, 10, 13> with chord (4, 10)
- Cycle <1, 3, 6, 8> with chord (3, 6)
- Cycle <1, 4, 8, 2> with chord (4, 2)
- Cycle <1, 9, 10, 6> with chord (9, 6)
- Cycle <2, 8, 4, 10> with chord (8, 4)
- Cycle <2, 12, 14, 7> with chord (12, 14)
- Cycle <3, 1, 4, 13> with chord (1, 13)
- Cycle <5, 9, 10, 6> with chord (9, 6)
- Cycle <5, 11, 7, 14> with chord (11, 7)
- Cycle <6, 3, 12, 14> with chord (3, 12)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [10].
