Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 1, 3, 6> has chord (1, 3)
- <0, 1, 3, 8> has chord (3, 8)
- <0, 1, 3, 10> has chord (1, 3)
- <0, 1, 3, 4> has chord (1, 3)
- <1, 3, 6, 8> has chord (1, 8)
- <1, 3, 6, 10> has chord (1, 10)
- <1, 3, 4, 6> has chord (1, 4)
- <1, 3, 8, 6> has chord (3, 6)
- <1, 3, 8, 7> has chord (3, 8)
- <1, 3, 8, 5> has chord (3, 8)
- <1, 3, 8, 14> has chord (3, 8)
- <1, 3, 10, 7> has chord (3, 10)
- <1, 3, 10, 5> has chord (1, 10)
- <1, 3, 10, 6> has chord (1, 10)
- <1, 3, 4, 10> has chord (1, 4)
- <1, 3, 4, 11> has chord (1, 4)
- <1, 3, 4, 6> has chord (1, 4)
- <1, 3, 6, 10> has chord (1, 6)
- <1, 3, 6, 8> has chord (1, 6)
- <1, 8, 7, 10> has chord (8, 7)
- <1, 8, 7, 5> has chord (8, 7)
- <1, 8, 7, 12> has chord (8, 7)
- <1, 8, 7, 14> has chord (8, 7)

Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have found 21 chordal 4-cycles in total. Therefore, the final count is [21].
