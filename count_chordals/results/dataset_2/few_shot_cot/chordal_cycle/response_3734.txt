Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
<0, 15, 9, 21>, <3, 26, 5, 20>, <3, 12, 4, 29>, <8, 13, 17, 1>, <8, 23, 7, 28>, <8, 11, 6, 22>, <8, 1, 14, 2>, <8, 13, 17, 1>, <13, 8, 1, 14>, <13, 17, 1, 14>, <13, 17, 8, 1>, <23, 18, 19, 14>, <23, 8, 1, 14>, <23, 7, 24, 28>, <23, 27, 22, 12>, <1, 8, 13, 17>, <26, 3, 12, 22>, <26, 5, 20, 9>, <26, 0, 15, 9>, <21, 28, 7, 24>, <21, 0, 15, 9>, <21, 9, 20, 16>, <21, 14, 2, 14>, <21, 28, 25, 16>, <28, 25, 16, 10>, <17, 13, 8, 23>, <4, 12, 22, 6>, <5, 26, 3, 12>, <19, 18, 3, 26>, <11, 8, 13, 17>, <14, 21, 0, 15>, <29, 4, 12, 22> 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0, 15, (3, 26), 21>, <3, 26, (18, 23), 12>, <8, 13, (1, 17), 8>, <8, 23, (7, 28), 24>, <8, 11, (6, 22), 12>, <8, 1, (14, 2), 8>, <13, 17, (8, 1), 14>, <23, 18, (19, 14), 23>, <23, 8, (1, 14), 23>, <23, 7, (24, 28), 23>, <23, 27, (12, 29), 22>, <1, 8, (13, 17), 1>, <26, 3, (12, 22), 26>, <26, 5, (20, 9), 26>, <21, 28, (7, 24), 21>, <21, 0, (15, 9), 21>, <21, 9, (20, 16), 21>, <21, 14, (2, 14), 21>, <21, 28, (25, 16), 21>, <28, 25, (16, 10), 28>, <17, 13, (8, 23), 17>, <4, 12, (22, 6), 4>, <5, 26, (3, 12), 5>, <19, 18, (3, 26), 19>, <11, 8, (13, 17), 11>, <14, 21, (0, 15), 14>, <29, 4, (12, 22), 29>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
[0]
