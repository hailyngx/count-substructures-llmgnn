Response:
Step 1: 
Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:

<1, 3, 4, 10, 13>
<1, 3, 4, 17, 0>
<1, 16, 2, 11, 19>
<1, 19, 7, 8, 0>
<2, 16, 7, 19, 11>
<3, 1, 16, 7, 19>
<4, 3, 1, 16, 2>
<4, 3, 10, 13, 15>
<4, 3, 10, 13, 6>
<4, 3, 4, 8, 11>
<4, 17, 11, 2, 16>
<4, 17, 0, 2, 16>
<4, 17, 11, 15, 12>
<4, 17, 0, 6, 18>
<5, 9, 17, 18, 6>
<6, 18, 17, 0, 8>
<6, 18, 17, 4, 3>
<6, 13, 10, 4, 17>
<7, 16, 2, 0, 8>
<7, 19, 11, 2, 16>
<7, 19, 11, 15, 12>
<8, 7, 16, 1, 3>
<8, 7, 19, 11, 2>
<8, 11, 15, 12, 13>
<9, 5, 17, 4, 3>
<11, 2, 0, 6, 18>
<11, 15, 13, 10, 4>
<11, 17, 4, 3, 1>
<13, 15, 11, 17, 0>
<15, 13, 10, 3, 1>
<16, 1, 19, 11, 2>
<17, 4, 3, 1, 16>
<18, 17, 4, 3, 10>
<19, 1, 3, 4, 17>

Step 2:
Identifying the cycles with exactly one chord:
- <4, 17, 11, 2, 16>
- <4, 17, 0, 2, 16>
- <7, 19, 11, 2, 16>
- <13, 15, 11, 17, 0>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which are the cycles without exactly one chord:
- There are 33 cycles without exactly one chord.
