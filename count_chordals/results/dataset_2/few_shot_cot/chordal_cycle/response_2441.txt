Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 6, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in this graph. Let's list them:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 1>
- Cycle 2: <3, 1, 5, 7>
- Cycle 3: <4, 1, 5, 9>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 5, 9>
- Cycle 5: <6, 1, 4, 8>
- Cycle 6: <2, 3, 7, 5>
- Cycle 7: <9, 8, 4, 5>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 1) or (9, 4)
- Cycle 2 is chordal: <3, (1, 5), 7>
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 9) or (4, 5)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (0, 7) or (5, 9)
- Cycle 5 is chordal: <6, (1, 4), 8>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (3, 7) or (5, 2)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (8, 5) or (4, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles: [2]

So, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<3, (1, 5), 7>
<6, (1, 4), 8>
