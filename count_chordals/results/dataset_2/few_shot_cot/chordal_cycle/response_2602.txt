Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

There is one unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph: <5, (1, 6), 7>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
