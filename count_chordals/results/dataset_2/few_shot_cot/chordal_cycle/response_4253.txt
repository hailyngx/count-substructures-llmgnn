Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (1, 13) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 6) (12, 0) (12, 6) (12, 8) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 6) (0, 3) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 10) (0, 8) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 0) (10, 2) (2, 10) (2, 9) (2, 13) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 13) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 12) (6, 11) (6, 14) (6, 8) (8, 1) (8, 12) (8, 0) (8, 14) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 2) (13, 14) (5, 1) (5, 11) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 12, 11, 10, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 11, 5, 13, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 10, 9, and node 13
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 14, 10, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 13, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 12, 11, 14, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 10, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 12, 0, 14, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 10 is connected to node 7, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 12 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, and node 13

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
<2, (9, 13), 4, 7)>
<5, (11, 1), 13, 4)>
<3, (10, 0), 12, 6)>
<6, (4, 12), 3, 14)>
<8, (14, 6), 0, 12)>

Since there are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, the final answer is [5].
