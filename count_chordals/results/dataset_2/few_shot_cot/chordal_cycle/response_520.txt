Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 27, 3, 1>
- <0, 27, 3, 20>
- <0, 29, 9, 4>
- <0, 29, 16, 5>
- <0, 29, 18, 2>
- <1, 3, 20, 11>
- <1, 3, 27, 8>
- <1, 13, 2, 18>
- <1, 13, 17, 4>
- <2, 13, 17, 4>
- <2, 22, 12, 1>
- <4, 21, 8, 27>
- <4, 9, 18, 2>
- <4, 9, 25, 10>
- <5, 16, 0, 27>
- <5, 16, 29, 18>
- <9, 18, 11, 20>
- <10, 5, 16, 0>
- <10, 25, 19, 0>
- <11, 20, 3, 27>
- <14, 15, 24, 28>
- <17, 13, 1, 7>
- <17, 13, 2, 22>
- <17, 18, 29, 0>
- <17, 4, 21, 8>
- <18, 2, 13, 1>
- <18, 9, 25, 19>
- <19, 0, 27, 3>
- <20, 3, 1, 7>
- <21, 4, 9, 25>
- <26, 28, 24, 15>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles (with exactly one chord):
- <0, 27, 3, 1, (1, 3)>
- <1, 13, 2, 18, (13, 18)>
- <5, 16, 0, 27, (5, 27)>
- <9, 18, 11, 20, (9, 20)>
- <14, 15, 24, 28, (15, 24)>
- <17, 13, 1, 7, (13, 7)>
- <17, 4, 21, 8, (21, 4)>
- <18, 2, 13, 1, (13, 2)>
- <18, 9, 25, 19, (19, 25)>

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
