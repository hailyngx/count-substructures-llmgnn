Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 14, 9, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 2, 3, 5>
- Cycle 3: <1, 9, 14, 13, 5>
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 7, 2, 3>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 12, 4, 11>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 11, 4, 12>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 5, 13, 8>
- Cycle 8: <1, 3, 12, 4, 6>
- Cycle 9: <1, 3, 2, 7, 0>
- Cycle 10: <2, 3, 12, 4, 6>
- Cycle 11: <2, 7, 0, 1, 9>
- Cycle 12: <3, 5, 13, 6, 4>
- Cycle 13: <4, 10, 12, 9, 1>
- Cycle 14: <4, 11, 5, 13, 6>
- Cycle 15: <6, 13, 8, 11, 4>
- Cycle 16: <7, 14, 13, 6, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 5: <1, 9, 12, 4, 11> has exactly one chord 4-12.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0].
