Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0, 6, 27, 15> has chord (6, 15)
<1, 13, 17, 20> has chord (13, 17)
<1, 13, 21, 19> has chord (13, 19)
<1, 22, 12, 28> has chord (12, 28)
<2, 16, 11, 24> has chord (16, 11)
<2, 25, 6, 27> has chord (6, 27)
<3, 7, 14, 22> has chord (7, 14)
<4, 25, 2, 16> has chord (25, 16)
<5, 9, 16, 11> has chord (9, 16)
<5, 19, 21, 10> has chord (19, 10)
<5, 20, 17, 13> has chord (17, 13)
<6, 18, 2, 16> has chord (18, 2)
<6, 25, 4, 5> has chord (4, 5)
<10, 26, 11, 24> has chord (26, 11)
<8, 26, 11, 16> has chord (26, 11)
<8, 29, 24, 11> has chord (29, 24)
<11, 24, 8, 29> has chord (24, 8)
<13, 17, 20, 5> has chord (17, 20)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
In this case, there is one chordless 4-cycle, which is <0, 6, 27, 15>.
Therefore, the final count inside brackets is [1].
