Response:
The adjacency list provided represents a graph with 30 nodes and 90 edges. To find the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph, we need to follow the steps mentioned earlier.

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- The cycles of length 4 in this graph are:
    - (1, 17, 27, 28)
    - (1, 17, 8, 25)
    - (1, 0, 25, 13)
    - (1, 0, 25, 8)
    - (1, 2, 6, 5)
    - (1, 2, 6, 9)
    - (1, 2, 14, 25)
    - (1, 2, 14, 9)
    - (17, 27, 22, 7)

    - (8, 17, 27, 22)
    - (8, 17, 27, 13)
    - (8, 17, 4, 29)
    - (8, 17, 4, 29)
    - (8, 19, 3, 21)
    - (8, 19, 21, 3)
    - (8, 19, 16, 15)
    - (8, 19, 15, 14)
    - (8, 19, 15, 12)

    - <20, 3, 23, 24>
    - <21, 3, 23, 24>
    - <8, 17, 27, 22>
    - <8, 17, 27, 13>
    - <8, 17, 4, 29>
    - <8, 19, 3, 21>
    - <8, 19, 16, 15>

    - <13, 27, 22, 9>
    - <13, 27, 22, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [22].
