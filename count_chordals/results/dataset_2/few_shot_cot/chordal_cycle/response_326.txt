Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 0, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- <0, 3, 4, 7, 5>
- <0, 3, 6, 4, 9>
- <0, 5, 7, 4, 9>
- <1, 5, 7, 4, 9>
- <2, 3, 4, 9, 7>
- <2, 3, 6, 4, 9>
- <2, 3, 8, 6, 1>
- <4, 9, 2, 3, 6>
- <5, 7, 4, 6, 1>
- <6, 1, 5, 7, 4>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are as follows:
- <0, 3, 4, 7, 5> --> Chord: (4, 5)
- <0, 3, 6, 4, 9> --> Chord: (6, 9)
- <0, 5, 7, 4, 9> --> Chord: (7, 9)
- <1, 5, 7, 4, 9> --> Chord: (7, 9)
- <2, 3, 4, 9, 7> --> Chord: (4, 7)
- <2, 3, 6, 4, 9> --> Chord: (6, 9)
- <2, 3, 8, 6, 1> --> Chord: (8, 1)
- <4, 9, 2, 3, 6> --> Chord: (2, 6)
- <5, 7, 4, 6, 1> --> Chord: (4, 1)
- <6, 1, 5, 7, 4> --> Chord: (5, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [0].

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
