Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 8) (3, 14) (3, 4) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 13) (2, 0) (2, 6) (4, 3) (4, 18) (4, 19) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 16) (18, 12) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 17) (13, 0) (13, 5) (11, 1) (11, 7) (11, 12) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 17) (9, 18) (9, 8) (7, 11) (7, 19) (7, 17) (14, 1) (14, 3) (15, 12) (15, 16) (19, 0) (19, 4) (19, 7) (19, 6) (19, 12) (12, 18) (12, 5) (12, 11) (12, 15) (12, 19) (6, 2) (6, 19) (6, 10) (10, 8) (10, 6) (16, 18) (16, 15) (17, 5) (17, 8) (17, 7)

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is: 

<5, (12, 19), 18, 4>

Considering this unique chordal 4-cycle, the final number of chordless cycles found is [1].
