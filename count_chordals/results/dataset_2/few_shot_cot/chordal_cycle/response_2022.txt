Response:
Step 1: 
We can identify the cycles of length 4 or more in the graph using the adjacency list:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 17, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 3, 21, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 26, 12, 0>
- Cycle 4: <2, 6, 7, 24, 2>
- Cycle 5: <2, 13, 11, 27, 15, 23, 4, 26, 11, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 28, 10, 20, 6, 2>
- Cycle 7: <4, 23, 15, 8, 17, 1, 0, 25, 7, 24, 6, 2, 28, 18, 19, 22, 12, 4>
- Cycle 8: <5, 12, 26, 11, 27, 15, 8, 17, 1, 0, 25, 7, 6, 2, 13, 11, 9, 3, 21, 23, 4, 16, 8, 22, 12, 5>
- Cycle 9: <6, 24, 7, 25, 0, 1, 17, 8, 15, 27, 11, 9, 3, 21, 23, 4, 26, 12, 22, 19, 29, 20, 10, 28, 2>
- Cycle 10: <7, 21, 3, 9, 0, 1, 17, 8, 16, 4, 23, 15, 27, 11, 26, 12, 22, 19, 29, 20, 6, 24, 7>
- Cycle 11: <8, 17, 1, 0, 25, 7, 6, 24, 22, 19, 29, 20, 28, 18, 19, 22, 12, 26, 4, 16, 8>
- Cycle 12: <11, 27, 15, 8, 17, 1, 0, 25, 7, 6, 2, 13, 9, 3, 21, 23, 4, 26, 12, 22, 19, 29, 20, 10, 28, 2>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, let's identify the chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord):
- Chordal Cycle 1: <0, (2, 28), 10, 20, 6>
- Chordal Cycle 2: <4, (12, 26), 11, 27, 15>
- Chordal Cycle 3: <8, (22, 19), 29, 20, 28>
- Chordal Cycle 4: <11, (13, 9), 3, 21, 23>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [8]
