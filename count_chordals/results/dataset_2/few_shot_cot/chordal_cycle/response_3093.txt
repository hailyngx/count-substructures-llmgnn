Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <15, 3, 2, 4, 13>
2. <5, 4, 13, 2, 3>
3. <8, 1, 17, 6, 0>
4. <9, 18, 17, 1, 8>
5. <10, 16, 5, 17, 1>
6. <11, 3, 15, 12, 8>
7. <12, 15, 7, 17, 6>
8. <14, 9, 18, 17, 6>
9. <10, 14, 9, 18, 17>
10. <5, 10, 14, 9, 18>
11. <4, 5, 10, 16, 5>
12. <19, 3, 15, 7, 17>
13. <6, 0, 11, 15, 7>
14. <13, 2, 3, 6, 0>

Step 2:

The chordal 4-cycle in the graph is:
<15, 3, 19, 6, 17> (Chord: 19)

Step 3:

The number of chordless cycles found is [13].
