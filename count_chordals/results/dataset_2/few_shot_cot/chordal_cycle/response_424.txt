Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 14) (1, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 13) (14, 1) (14, 0) (14, 5) (14, 10) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 14) (5, 7) (11, 6) (11, 13) (11, 12) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 13) (12, 9) (13, 2) (13, 0) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 9) (10, 14) (10, 7) (10, 9) (9, 7) (9, 12) (9, 13) (9, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 14, 5, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 14, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, 13, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 0, 14, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, 11, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 10, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 12, 13, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 14, 7, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 13, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 11, 13, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 2, 0, 11, 12, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 0, 5, and node 10

Response:
The graph has the following unique chordal 4-cycle along with their chords:
<0, 4, 8, 5> with a non-adjacent chord (0, 8)
<6, 3, 4, 2> with a non-adjacent chord (3, 2)
<9, 7, 10, 14> with a non-adjacent chord (7, 10)
<13, 2, 8, 5> with a non-adjacent chord (8, 5)
<12, 6, 11, 13> with a non-adjacent chord (6, 11)

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
