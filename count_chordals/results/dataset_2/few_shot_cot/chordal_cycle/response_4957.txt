Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with all existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (2, 5, 9, 15, 3, 2)
- Cycle 2: (2, 5, 14, 18, 11, 0, 12, 4, 17, 13, 7, 14, 16, 9, 15, 8, 13, 17, 4, 12, 0, 11, 18, 14)
- Cycle 3: (3, 15, 9, 5, 14, 18, 11, 0, 12, 4, 17, 13, 7, 10, 2, 5, 8, 13, 17, 4, 12, 2, 10, 7, 14, 16, 9)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <2, (9, 15)>
- <3, (14, 18)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [2] chordal 4-cycles.
