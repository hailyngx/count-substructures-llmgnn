Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- From the above cycles, cycle 1, 5, 6, and 13 have exactly one chord. 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final count is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 11, 10, 3, 27, 5, 0>
- <4, 9, 12, 17, 22, 29, 23, 4>
- <6, 21, 16, 3, 10, 13, 18, 24, 12, 20, 26, 25, 1, 19, 23, 29, 22, 7, 17, 15, 8, 5, 27, 6>
- <13, 18, 24, 12, 20, 26, 25, 1, 19, 23, 29, 22, 17, 15, 11, 10, 13>
