Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 11-16-5-13-11
- Cycle 2: 11-14-1-17-11
- Cycle 3: 11-14-4-19-11
- Cycle 4: 11-14-2-18-11
- Cycle 5: 11-18-13-15-11
- Cycle 6: 11-18-13-17-11
- Cycle 7: 11-18-2-4-11
- Cycle 8: 16-8-10-12-16
- Cycle 9: 16-8-10-0-16
- Cycle 10: 16-5-9-19-16
- Cycle 11: 16-5-13-18-16

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <11, (5, 13), 16>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <11, (1, 17), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <11, (4, 19), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <11, (2, 18), 14>

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the count in brackets is [4].
