Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with every edge in the cycle:
- (11, 16, 11, 1)
- (11, 16, 11, 5)
- (11, 1, 7, 14)
- (11, 1, 7, 19)
- (11, 1, 7, 3, 12)
- (11, 1, 7, 3, 7)
- (11, 1, 7, 14, 18)
- (11, 5, 9, 17)
- (11, 5, 9, 19)
- (11, 5, 2, 12)
- (11, 5, 2, 4)
- (11, 5, 9, 4)
- (11, 5, 9, 17)
- (11, 5, 9, 19)
- (11, 5, 9, 4, 13)
- (11, 5, 9, 17, 10)
- (11, 5, 9, 19, 7)
- (16, 11, 1, 7)
- (16, 11, 1, 7, 3)
- (16, 11, 5, 9)
- (16, 11, 5, 2)
- (16, 11, 5, 9, 17)
- (16, 11, 5, 9, 19)
- (16, 11, 5, 2, 12)
- (16, 11, 5, 2, 4)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <11, 16, 11, 1> has exactly one chord (11, 1)
- <11, 5, 9, 17> has exactly one chord (5, 17)
- <11, 5, 2, 12> has exactly one chord (5, 12)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
