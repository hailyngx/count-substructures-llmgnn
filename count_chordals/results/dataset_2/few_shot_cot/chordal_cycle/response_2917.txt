Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <5, 9, 2, 4>
2. <5, 9, 3, 1>
3. <5, 1, 2, 4>
4. <5, 1, 8, 3>
5. <5, 0, 6, 4>
6. <5, 0, 1, 8>
7. <9, 5, 0, 6>
8. <9, 5, 1, 3>
9. <9, 2, 7, 4>
10. <9, 3, 8, 1>
11. <4, 7, 2, 9>
12. <4, 7, 2, 6>
13. <4, 2, 1, 8>
14. <4, 0, 6, 8>
15. <7, 4, 0, 6>
16. <1, 5, 0, 6>
17. <1, 5, 9, 3>
18. <1, 3, 8, 6>
19. <3, 9, 2, 7>
20. <3, 9, 5, 8>
21. <6, 4, 0, 1>
22. <6, 4, 7, 2>
23. <6, 2, 1, 8>
24. <6, 0, 5, 1>
25. <8, 5, 0, 6>
26. <8, 5, 9, 2>
27. <8, 1, 3, 9>
28. <0, 5, 1, 8>
29. <0, 5, 9, 2>
30. <0, 4, 7, 2>
31. <2, 9, 5, 8>
32. <2, 9, 3, 1>
33. <2, 4, 7, 3>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <5, 9, 2, 4, (5, 9)>
2. <5, 1, 2, 4, (1, 2)>
3. <5, 1, 8, 3, (5, 1)>
4. <9, 5, 0, 6, (5, 0)>
5. <4, 7, 2, 9, (4, 2)>
6. <1, 3, 8, 6, (3, 8)>
7. <3, 9, 2, 7, (9, 2)>
8. <6, 4, 0, 1, (4, 0)>
9. <8, 1, 3, 9, (8, 9)>
10. <0, 5, 1, 8, (0, 1)>

Step 3:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [10].
