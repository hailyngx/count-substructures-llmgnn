Response:
Following the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4:
- <0, 4, 10, 0>
- <0, 7, 12, 9>
- <0, 7, 14, 7>
- <0, 10, 4, 11>
- <1, 6, 5, 9>
- <1, 9, 10, 2>
- <3, 5, 6, 13>
- <4, 8, 2, 10>
- <4, 11, 3, 12>
- <5, 9, 10, 4>
- <5, 9, 11, 13>
- <6, 1, 2, 5>
- <6, 3, 11, 13>
- <7, 0, 4, 8>
- <12, 9, 5, 6>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 10, 0> has chord (10, 4)
- <0, 7, 12, 9> has chord (7, 12)
- <0, 7, 14, 7> has chord (7, 14)
- <0, 10, 4, 11> has chord (4, 11)
- <1, 6, 5, 9> has chord (5, 9)
- <1, 9, 10, 2> does not have a chord
- <3, 5, 6, 13> has chord (5, 6)
- <4, 8, 2, 10> does not have a chord
- <4, 11, 3, 12> does not have a chord
- <5, 9, 10, 4> has chord (9, 10)
- <5, 9, 11, 13> has chord (9, 13)
- <6, 1, 2, 5> has chord (1, 2)
- <6, 3, 11, 13> has chord (3, 11)
- <7, 0, 4, 8> has chord (0, 4)
- <12, 9, 5, 6> has chord (9, 5)

Step 3: Counting chordless cycles: [2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found are:
- <1, 9, 10, 2>
- <4, 11, 3, 12>
