Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle in node 0: (0, 13, 22, 14, 0)
- Cycle in node 3: (3, 20, 0, 14, 4, 9, 3)
- Cycle in node 5: (5, 11, 24, 9, 4, 14, 5)
- Cycle in node 7: (7, 13, 22, 18, 17, 28, 25, 24, 11, 9, 16, 7)
- Cycle in node 10: (10, 7, 16, 3, 20, 15, 0, 14, 4, 23, 26, 2, 6, 10)
- Cycle in node 12: (12, 5, 11, 24, 25, 28, 17, 21, 1, 3, 16, 19, 6, 10, 12)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, (13, 22), 15, 14, 0>
- <3, (20, 0), 4, 9, 14, 3>
- <5, (11, 24), 9, 4, 14, 5>
- <7, (13, 22), 18, 17, 28, 25, 24, 9, 16, 7>
- <10, (7, 16), 3, 20, 15, 0, 14, 4, 23, 26, 10>
- <12, (5, 11), 24, 25, 28, 17, 21, 1, 3, 19, 12>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
