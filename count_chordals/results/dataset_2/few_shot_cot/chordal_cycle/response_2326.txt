Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph with existing edges:
- <0, 20, 1, 22> (4-cycle)
- <0, 25, 19, 3> (4-cycle)
- <0, 25, 8, 11> (4-cycle)
- <0, 25, 10, 21> (4-cycle)
- <0, 25, 10, 8> (4-cycle)
- <1, 20, 27, 23> (4-cycle)
- <1, 22, 21, 27> (4-cycle)
- <1, 22, 21, 10> (4-cycle)
- <3, 1, 20, 27> (4-cycle)
- <3, 1, 22, 21> (4-cycle)
- <3, 9, 24, 15> (4-cycle)
- <10, 25, 0, 26> (4-cycle)
- <10, 25, 19, 3> (4-cycle)
- <10, 21, 27, 23> (4-cycle)
- <8, 11, 16, 15> (4-cycle)
- <8, 11, 16, 18> (4-cycle)
- <8, 11, 16, 15> (4-cycle)
- <8, 25, 0, 26> (4-cycle)
- <8, 25, 19, 3> (4-cycle)
- <8, 23, 21, 27> (4-cycle)
- <11, 16, 15, 24> (4-cycle)

- <16, 11, 8, 23> (4-cycle)
- <16, 18, 26, 12> (4-cycle)
- <20, 1, 3, 9> (4-cycle)
- <20, 1, 22, 21> (4-cycle)
- <20, 1, 22, 21> (4-cycle)
- <20, 27, 23, 21> (4-cycle)
- <21, 10, 8, 25> (4-cycle)
- <21, 10, 25, 19> (4-cycle)
- <21, 23, 27, 7> (4-cycle)

- <25, 19, 6, 14> (4-cycle)
- <26, 0, 20, 27> (4-cycle)
- <26, 0, 25, 10> (4-cycle)
- <26, 18, 16, 11> (4-cycle)
- <27, 23, 21, 4> (4-cycle)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 25, 8, 11> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord <8, 11>
- <10, 25, 19, 3> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord <19, 3>
- <1, 22, 21, 27> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord <21, 27>
- <3, 9, 24, 15> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord <9, 24>
- <8, 23, 21, 27> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord <21, 27>
- <16, 11, 8, 25> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord <11, 25>
- <20, 1, 22, 21> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord <1, 21>
- <25, 19, 6, 14> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord <19, 14>
- <26, 0, 20, 27> is a chordal 4-cycle with chord <0, 27>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 9.

Therefore, the final answer is [9].
