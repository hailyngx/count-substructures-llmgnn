Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
After checking each cycle, we find the following chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 2, 14, 13> (Chord: (2, 14))
<2, 0, 19, 12> (Chord: (0, 19))
<3, 13, 9, 15> (Chord: (13, 9))
<6, 11, 12, 17> (Chord: (11, 12))
<7, 10, 2, 14> (Chord: (10, 14))
<8, 6, 12, 17> (Chord: (6, 12))
<9, 15, 16, 17> (Chord: (15, 16))
<10, 1, 7, 5> (Chord: (1, 7))
<13, 3, 7, 11> (Chord: (3, 7))
<14, 2, 0, 19> (Chord: (2, 0))
<15, 9, 13, 3> (Chord: (9, 13))
<18, 15, 9, 13> (Chord: (15, 9))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Hence, the final count is [12].
