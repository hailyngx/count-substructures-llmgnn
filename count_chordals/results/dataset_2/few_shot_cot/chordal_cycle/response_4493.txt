Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <3, (13, 17), 12)>.

Following the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
Step 1: Identify cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges: 
- Cycle 1: 3 - 13 - 10 - 12 - 3
- Cycle 2: 3 - 14 - 11 - 19 - 3
- Cycle 3: 3 - 17 - 12 - 0 - 3

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (13, 17)
- Cycle 2 has no chords
- Cycle 3 has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found: [1]

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
