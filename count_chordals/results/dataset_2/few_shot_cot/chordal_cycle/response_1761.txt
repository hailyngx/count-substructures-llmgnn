Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle <3, 6, 5, 4>
2. Cycle <3, 6, 2, 7>
3. Cycle <3, 15, 11, 16>
4. Cycle <3, 15, 19, 9>
5. Cycle <3, 15, 19, 8>
6. Cycle <6, 5, 13, 17>
7. Cycle <6, 2, 10, 11>
8. Cycle <6, 2, 7, 17>
9. Cycle <6, 2, 16, 18>
10. Cycle <5, 13, 17, 7>
11. Cycle <5, 13, 0, 10>
12. Cycle <5, 4, 1, 14>
13. Cycle <5, 4, 14, 3>
14. Cycle <4, 1, 14, 3>
15. Cycle <4, 1, 14, 12>
16. Cycle <4, 14, 12, 1>
17. Cycle <2, 7, 17, 15>
18. Cycle <2, 7, 8, 19>
19. Cycle <2, 7, 17, 13>
20. Cycle <2, 11, 10, 0>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal cycle <3, 6, 5, 4> with chord (3, 5)
- Chordal cycle <6, 5, 13, 17> with chord (5, 13)
- Chordal cycle <5, 13, 0, 10> with chord (13, 10)
- Chordal cycle <5, 4, 1, 14> with chord (4, 1)
- Chordal cycle <4, 1, 14, 12> with chord (1, 14)
- Chordal cycle <2, 7, 17, 15> with chord (7, 17)
- Chordal cycle <2, 11, 10, 0> with chord (11, 10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 

There are 20 cycles in total, out of which 14 cycles are chordal. 
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [6]. 

The unique chordless 4-cycle is: <3, 15, 19, 9>.
