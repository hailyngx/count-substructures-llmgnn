Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 19) (11, 6) (11, 4) (16, 13) (1, 17) (1, 15) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 17) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 12) (10, 9) (10, 5) (8, 1) (8, 13) (8, 9) (8, 19) (13, 16) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 0) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 15) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 18) (17, 1) (17, 3) (17, 6) (15, 1) (15, 18) (15, 19) (15, 5) (9, 10) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 0) (19, 11) (19, 8) (19, 15) (12, 10) (12, 14) (6, 11) (6, 17) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 9) (14, 13) (14, 12) (14, 7) (7, 2) (7, 14) (5, 10) (5, 15)

Response:
There are a few chordal 4-cycles in this graph. Let me identify them for you:

1. <0, 3, 4, 18> with chord (3, 18)
2. <1, 15, 5, 10> with chord (15, 10)
3. <8, 1, 17, 6> with chord (1, 6)
4. <9, 8, 13, 16> with chord (8, 16)
5. <11, 4, 18, 9> with chord (4, 9)
6. <12, 10, 5, 15> with chord (10, 15)
7. <13, 2, 7, 14> with chord (2, 7)
8. <14, 7, 2, 13> with chord (7, 13)
9. <17, 1, 8, 19> with chord (1, 19)

Now, since we have identified 9 chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [9].
