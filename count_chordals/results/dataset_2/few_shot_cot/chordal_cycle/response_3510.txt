Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2: 
- There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3:
- After checking for chordal 4-cycles, we find that there are 0 chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the total number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
