Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are as follows:
1. (5, 6, 4, 5)
2. (5, 8, 1, 7, 5)
3. (5, 9, 7, 4, 5)
4. (4, 7, 3, 6, 4)
5. (3, 7, 1, 8, 3)
6. (1, 2, 8, 5, 1)
7. (2, 8, 0, 1, 2)
8. (0, 1, 7, 9, 0)
9. (0, 3, 6, 5, 0)
10. (0, 8, 5, 9, 0)

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <5, (9, 6), 4, 5>
2. <5, (5, 9), 8, 1>
3. <5, (5, 9), 4, 7>
4. <4, (7, 3), 6, 4>
5. <3, (7, 1), 8, 3>
6. <1, (1, 8), 2, 5>
7. <2, (8, 0), 1, 2>
8. <0, (1, 9), 7, 0>
9. <0, (3, 5), 6, 0>
10. <0, (8, 9), 5, 0>

Step 3:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles in total, so the final count is [10].
