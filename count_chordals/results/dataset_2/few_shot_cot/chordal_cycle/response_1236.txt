Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <1, 9, 5, 2, 1> with chord (2, 5)
- Cycle <3, 1, 9, 5, 3> with chord (1, 5)
- Cycle <1, 9, 6, 2, 1> with chord (6, 2)
- Cycle <3, 1, 8, 2, 3> with chord (1, 2)
- Cycle <3, 1, 8, 7, 3> with chord (1, 7)
- Cycle <3, 1, 8, 7, 0, 3> with chord (1, 7)
- Cycle <3, 7, 5, 9, 3> with chord (5, 9)
- Cycle <3, 7, 5, 2, 3> with chord (5, 2)
- Cycle <4, 3, 1, 8, 4> with chord (3, 8)
- Cycle <7, 5, 9, 1, 7> with chord (5, 1)
- Cycle <7, 5, 2, 1, 7> with chord (5, 1)
- Cycle <7, 5, 2, 8, 7> with chord (5, 8)
- Cycle <1, 2, 6, 9, 1> with chord (2, 9)
- Cycle <1, 2, 6, 9, 5, 1> with chord (2, 5)
- Cycle <2, 9, 6, 1, 2> with chord (9, 1)
- Cycle <2, 9, 6, 1, 8, 2> with chord (9, 8)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 5, 2, 1> with chord (2, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 1, 9, 5, 3> with chord (1, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 6, 2, 1> with chord (6, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 1, 8, 2, 3> with chord (1, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 1, 8, 7, 3> with chord (1, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 1, 8, 7, 0, 3> with chord (1, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 7, 5, 9, 3> with chord (5, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 7, 5, 2, 3> with chord (5, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, 3, 1, 8, 4> with chord (3, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, 5, 9, 1, 7> with chord (5, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, 5, 2, 1, 7> with chord (5, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, 5, 2, 8, 7> with chord (5, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 2, 6, 9, 1> with chord (2, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 2, 6, 9, 5, 1> with chord (2, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 9, 6, 1, 2> with chord (9, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 9, 6, 1, 8, 2> with chord (9, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [16]
