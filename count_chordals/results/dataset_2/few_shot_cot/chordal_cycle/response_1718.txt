- <0, 2, 8, 1>
- <2, 8, 1, 14>
- <2, 8, 1, 5>
- <2, 8, 12, 11>
- <2, 4, 2, 8>
- <2, 4, 2, 14>
- <2, 13, 5, 1>
- <3, 1, 5, 7>

- <10, 3, 1, 8>
- <10, 3, 7, 11>
- <10, 11, 5, 13>
- <11, 9, 6, 0>
- <11, 9, 6, 7>
- <11, 7, 6, 0>
- <12, 8, 2, 4>
- <12, 8, 2, 14>

- <13, 9, 6, 0>
- <13, 9, 6, 7>
- <13, 9, 11, 7>
- <14, 1, 3, 0>
- <14, 1, 3, 7>
- <14, 2, 8, 1>
- <14, 2, 8, 12>
- <14, 5, 7, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle <0, 6, 7, 3> has a chord (0, 3).
- The cycle <0, 2, 8, 1> has a chord (2, 8).
- The cycle <2, 8, 1, 14> has a chord (1, 14).
- The cycle <2, 8, 12, 11> has a chord (8, 11).
- The cycle <2, 4, 2, 8> has a chord (2, 8).
- The cycle <2, 13, 5, 1> has a chord (5, 1).
- The cycle <3, 1, 5, 7> has a chord (1, 5).
- The cycle <5, 1, 8, 2> has a chord (1, 8).
- The cycle <7, 6, 0, 3> has a chord (0, 3).
- The cycle <7, 10, 3, 1> has a chord (3, 1).
- The cycle <9, 6, 0, 2> has a chord (6, 2).
- The cycle <9, 13, 5, 1> has a chord (5, 1).
- The cycle <10, 3, 1, 8> has a chord (1, 8).
- The cycle <10, 3, 7, 11> has a chord (3, 11).
- The cycle <11, 9, 6, 0> has a chord (9, 0).
- The cycle <11, 7, 6, 0> has a chord (6, 0).
- The cycle <12, 8, 2, 4> has a chord (8, 4).
- The cycle <13, 9, 6, 0> has a chord (9, 0).
- The cycle <13, 9, 11, 7> has a chord (9, 11).
- The cycle <14, 2, 8, 1> has a chord (2, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- There are 19 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [19].
