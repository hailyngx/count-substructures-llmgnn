Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle 1: <0, 17, 1, 11>
2. Cycle 2: <0, 17, 4, 6>
3. Cycle 3: <0, 17, 14, 7>
4. Cycle 4: <0, 19, 12, 13>
5. Cycle 5: <1, 3, 18, 2>
6. Cycle 6: <1, 3, 11, 16>
7. Cycle 7: <2, 14, 10, 9>
8. Cycle 8: <2, 14, 7, 5>
9. Cycle 9: <2, 18, 3, 11>

16. Cycle 16: <9, 10, 14, 7>
17. Cycle 17: <12, 13, 5, 6>
18. Cycle 18: <12, 19, 0, 17>
19. Cycle 19: <12, 15, 8, 6>
20. Cycle 20: <15, 18, 2, 14>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <2, 14, 7, 5> with a chord (2, 18).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 19 chordless cycles found.

Final count: [19]
