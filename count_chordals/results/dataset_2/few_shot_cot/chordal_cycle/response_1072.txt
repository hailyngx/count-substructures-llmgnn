Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 9, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 5, 4, 0, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 9, 4, 0, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 9, 4, 8, 2>
- Cycle 7: <2, 9, 7, 1, 2>
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 9: <4, 5, 1, 7, 4>
- Cycle 10: <4, 5, 3, 0, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 7, 1, 2, 4>
- Cycle 12: <6, 7, 1, 2, 6>
- Cycle 13: <6, 7, 4, 0, 6>
- Cycle 14: <7, 4, 8, 2, 7>
- Cycle 15: <7, 6, 2, 9, 7>
- Cycle 16: <8, 4, 0, 6, 8>
  
Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 3, 0>, Chord: (4, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 4, 9, 2, 0>, Chord: (4, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 5, 4, 0, 1>, Chord: (4, 0)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 5, 4, 8, 1>, Chord: (5, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 9, 7, 1, 2>, Chord: (9, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <3, 5, 4, 8, 3>, Chord: (5, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, 7, 1, 2, 4>, Chord: (7, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, 4, 0, 6, 8>, Chord: (4, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

- There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
