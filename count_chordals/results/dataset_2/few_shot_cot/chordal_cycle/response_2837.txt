Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 9, 14, 19>
2. <0, 16, 15, 1>
3. <0, 19, 2, 8>
4. <1, 13, 8, 2>
5. <1, 7, 5, 11>
6. <2, 8, 13, 3>
7. <4, 5, 7, 1>
8. <4, 18, 10, 2>
9. <5, 7, 1, 13>
10. <5, 16, 15, 1>
11. <6, 17, 14, 19>
12. <9, 8, 13, 3>
13. <10, 18, 4, 12>
14. <12, 10, 2, 8>
15. <12, 4, 5, 7>
16. <13, 15, 16, 12>
17. <14, 17, 6, 16>
18. <14, 19, 2, 8>
19. <16, 15, 13, 8>
20. <16, 0, 9, 3>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 14, 19> has one chord: (9, 14)
- <0, 16, 15, 1> has one chord: (16, 1)
- <0, 19, 2, 8> has one chord: (19, 2)
- <1, 13, 8, 2> has one chord: (13, 8)
- <1, 7, 5, 11> has no chords
- <2, 8, 13, 3> has one chord: (8, 13)
- <4, 5, 7, 1> has one chord: (5, 7)
- <4, 18, 10, 2> has one chord: (18, 10)
- <5, 7, 1, 13> has one chord: (7, 13)
- <5, 16, 15, 1> has one chord: (16, 1)
- <6, 17, 14, 19> has one chord: (17, 14)
- <9, 8, 13, 3> has one chord: (8, 13)
- <10, 18, 4, 12> has one chord: (18, 4)
- <12, 10, 2, 8> has one chord: (10, 2)
- <12, 4, 5, 7> has one chord: (4, 5)
- <13, 15, 16, 12> has no chords
- <14, 17, 6, 16> has one chord: (17, 6)
- <14, 19, 2, 8> has one chord: (19, 2)
- <16, 15, 13, 8> has one chord: (15, 13)
- <16, 0, 9, 3> has one chord: (0, 9)

Step 3:
There are 15 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [15].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 9, 14, 19>
<0, 16, 15, 1>
<0, 19, 2, 8>
<1, 13, 8, 2>
<1, 7, 5, 11>
<2, 8, 13, 3>
<4, 5, 7, 1>
<4, 18, 10, 2>
<5, 7, 1, 13>
<5, 16, 15, 1>
<6, 17, 14, 19>
<9, 8, 13, 3>
<10, 18, 4, 12>
<12, 10, 2, 8>
<12, 4, 5, 7>
