Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 13) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (10, 9) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 4) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 11) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 11) (13, 12) (13, 2) (13, 7) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 0) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 14) (0, 8) (0, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (6, 10) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 13) (2, 14) (2, 6) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 10) (4, 2)
