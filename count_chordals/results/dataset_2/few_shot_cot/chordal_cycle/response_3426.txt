Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 5, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 9, 6, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 8, 3, 9, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 3, 8, 5, 2, 7, 4, 9, 0)
- Cycle 5: (1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6, 5, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 2, 8, 5, 6, 9, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 6, 7, 4, 9, 3, 8, 1)
- Cycle 8: (2, 5, 6, 9, 3, 8, 7, 2)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 9, 6, 0) - Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 0) - Chord: (2, 7)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 8, 3, 9, 0) - Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 4: (0, 3, 8, 5, 2, 7, 4, 9, 0) - Chord: (5, 2)
- Cycle 5: (1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6, 5, 1) - Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 6: (1, 2, 8, 5, 6, 9, 4, 7, 1) - Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 7: (1, 6, 7, 4, 9, 3, 8, 1) - Not a chordal 4-cycle
- Cycle 8: (2, 5, 6, 9, 3, 8, 7, 2) - Not a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <2, (2, 7)>
- <4, (5, 2)>
