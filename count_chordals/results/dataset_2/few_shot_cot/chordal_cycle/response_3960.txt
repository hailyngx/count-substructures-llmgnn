Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 3, 5, 9>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 3, 7, 10>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 5, 12, 14>
- Cycle 4: <1, 3, 7, 10, 5>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 6, 9, 13>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 12, 14, 13>
- Cycle 7: <2, 4, 6, 8, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 6, 9, 13>
- Cycle 9: <2, 4, 12, 14, 13>
- Cycle 10: <3, 5, 9, 6, 14>
- Cycle 11: <3, 7, 10, 11, 12>
- Cycle 12: <4, 6, 9, 13, 2>
- Cycle 13: <4, 6, 14, 12, 5>
- Cycle 14: <5, 9, 6, 14, 12>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 3, 5, 9> has a chord 1-9
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 3, 7, 10> has no chord
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 5, 12, 14> has no chord
- Cycle 4: <1, 3, 7, 10, 5> has no chord
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 6, 9, 13> has no chord
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 12, 14, 13> has no chord
- Cycle 7: <2, 4, 6, 8, 1> has no chord
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 6, 9, 13> has a chord 4-9
- Cycle 9: <2, 4, 12, 14, 13> has a chord 4-13
- Cycle 10: <3, 5, 9, 6, 14> has no chord
- Cycle 11: <3, 7, 10, 11, 12> has no chord
- Cycle 12: <4, 6, 9, 13, 2> has no chord
- Cycle 13: <4, 6, 14, 12, 5> has a chord 6-12
- Cycle 14: <5, 9, 6, 14, 12> has no chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 9 chordless cycles found, so the count is [9].
