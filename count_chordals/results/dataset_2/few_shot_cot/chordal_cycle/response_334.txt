Response:
Step 1:  
List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 5>  
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 10, 6, 5>  
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 12, 7, 6, 5>  
- Cycle 4: <5, 1, 8, 3, 7, 6, 5>  
- Cycle 5: <5, 1, 11, 7, 6, 5>  
- Cycle 6: <5, 12, 7, 6, 9, 5>  
- Cycle 7: <9, 6, 7, 11, 10, 9>  
- Cycle 8: <9, 10, 14, 0, 7, 6, 9>  
- Cycle 9: <9, 10, 2, 7, 6, 9>  
- Cycle 10: <9, 10, 11, 7, 6, 9>  
- Cycle 11: <6, 7, 12, 10, 9, 6>  
- Cycle 12: <1, 11, 7, 6, 9, 5>  
- Cycle 13: <1, 13, 8, 3, 7, 6, 5>  
- Cycle 14: <1, 4, 13, 8, 3, 7, 6, 5>  
- Cycle 15: <13, 11, 7, 6, 9, 10, 14, 0, 13>  

Step 2:  
Checking for chords in the cycles:  
- Cycle 1 has a chord: <5, (9, 6), 5>  
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <5, (9, 10), 6, 5>  
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <5, (9, 12), 7, 6, 5>  
- Cycle 5 has a chord: <5, 1, (11, 7), 6, 5>  
- Cycle 6 has a chord: <5, 12, (7, 9), 6, 5>  
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <(9, 10), 6, 7, 11, 9>  
- Cycle 8 has a chord: <9, 10, (14, 0), 7, 6, 9>  
- Cycle 9 has a chord: <9, 10, (2, 7), 6, 9>  
- Cycle 10 has a chord: <9, 10, (11, 7), 6, 9>  

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordless cycles:  
There are 11 chordless cycles, so the final count is [11].
