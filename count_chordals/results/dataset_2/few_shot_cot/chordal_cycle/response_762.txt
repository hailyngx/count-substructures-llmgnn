Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 8, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 6, 8, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 5, 3, 1>
- Cycle 6: <3, 1, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 7: <3, 1, 7, 9, 3>
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 6, 7, 3>
- Cycle 9: <6, 7, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 10: <6, 7, 5, 3, 6>
- Cycle 11: <6, 9, 8, 4, 6>
- Cycle 12: <7, 9, 6, 5, 7>
- Cycle 13: <8, 4, 7, 5, 8>
- Cycle 14: <8, 4, 1, 3, 8>
- Cycle 15: <8, 6, 5, 3, 8>
- Cycle 16: <9, 7, 1, 4, 9>
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <<0, 4, 1, 3>, (1, 3)> 
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <<1, 7, 6, 8>, (6, 8)> 
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <<3, 5, 6, 7>, (5, 7)> 
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <<6, 9, 8, 4>, (8, 4)> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 12 chordless 4-cycles.

Therefore, the answer is [12].
