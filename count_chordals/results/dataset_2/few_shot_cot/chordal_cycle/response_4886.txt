Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <1, 7, 0, 11, 1> (of length 4)
        - Cycle 2: <1, 17, 14, 10, 3, 12, 7, 1> (of length 7)
        - Cycle 3: <1, 17, 14, 10, 3, 12, 13, 19, 16, 1> (of length 9)
        - Cycle 4: <1, 4, 19, 13, 12, 7, 1> (of length 6)
        - Cycle 5: <1, 4, 15, 2, 15, 14, 17, 1> (of length 7)
        - Cycle 6: <1, 4, 19, 16, 1> (of length 4)
        - Cycle 7: <1, 16, 19, 4, 1> (of length 4)
        - Cycle 8: <1, 7, 0, 13, 19, 4, 15, 11, 0, 1> (of length 9)
        - Cycle 9: <3, 12, 7, 1, 17, 14, 10, 3> (of length 7)
        - Cycle 10: <6, 11, 0, 7, 1, 17, 14, 10, 3, 12, 6> (of length 10)
        - Cycle 11: <8, 17, 14, 10, 3, 12, 13, 19, 8> (of length 8)
        - Cycle 12: <8, 17, 14, 10, 3, 12, 7, 1, 16, 19, 8> (of length 10)
        - Cycle 13: <8, 19, 13, 12, 7, 1, 16, 8> (of length 7)
        - Cycle 14: <10, 14, 17, 1, 16, 19, 13, 12, 3, 10> (of length 9)
        - Cycle 15: <10, 3, 12, 7, 1, 16, 19, 13, 10> (of length 8)
        - Cycle 16: <11, 18, 15, 2, 15, 14, 17, 8, 6, 11> (of length 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        Only Cycle 1: <1, 7, 0, 11, 1> has exactly one chord (0, 11).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There is 15 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [15].

So, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <1, 7, 0, 11, 1> with the chord (0, 11).
