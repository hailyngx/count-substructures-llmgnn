Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-6-3-5
- Cycle 2: 5-6-2-9-5
- Cycle 3: 5-0-1-4
- Cycle 4: 5-3-8-7
- Cycle 5: 5-0-8-7
- Cycle 6: 5-3-7-2
- Cycle 7: 9-5-3-7
- Cycle 8: 9-6-2-4
- Cycle 9: 9-1-4-2
- Cycle 10: 6-5-3-7

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <5, (0, 8), 4, 1>. The chord is the edge connecting nodes 0 and 8.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [9].
