Response:
In this graph, we can identify the chordal 4-cycles as follows:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<7, 4, 1, 10>
<7, 1, 4, 13>
<7, 13, 12, 5>
<7, 12, 13, 1>
<13, 7, 1, 10>
<13, 1, 4, 7>
<13, 7, 12, 5>
<13, 12, 7, 1>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <7, 4, 1, 10> has one chord: (4, 1)
- <7, 1, 4, 13> has one chord: (1, 13)
- <7, 13, 12, 5> has one chord: (13, 12)
- <13, 7, 1, 10> has one chord: (7, 1)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<7, 4, 1, 10> with chord (4, 1)
<7, 1, 4, 13> with chord (1, 13)
<7, 13, 12, 5> with chord (13, 12)
<13, 7, 1, 10> with chord (7, 1)
