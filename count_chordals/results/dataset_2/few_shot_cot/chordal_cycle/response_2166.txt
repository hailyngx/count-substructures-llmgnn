Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-1-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-4-7-2-0
- Cycle 3: 1-5-2-9-8-1
- Cycle 4: 2-5-4-8-2
- Cycle 5: 2-5-1-6-2
- Cycle 6: 2-9-6-1-2

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord {1, 6}
- Cycle 2 has a chord {4, 7}
- Cycle 3 has a chord {2, 8}
- Cycle 4 has a chord {5, 8}
- Cycle 5 has a chord {1, 6}
- Cycle 6 has a chord {1, 6}

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found. 

So, the final answer is [0].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, 5, 1, 6> with a chord (1, 6)
- <0, 5, 4, 7, 2> with a chord (4, 7)
- <1, 5, 2, 9, 8> with a chord (2, 8)
- <2, 5, 4, 8> with a chord (5, 8)
- <2, 5, 1, 6> with a chord (1, 6)
- <2, 9, 6, 1> with a chord (1, 6)
