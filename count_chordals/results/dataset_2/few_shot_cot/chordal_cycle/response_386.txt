Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 13, 2> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 5, 13>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 15, 2>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 17, 2>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 13, 2>
- Cycle 6: <1, 15, 2, 17>
- Cycle 7: <3, 11, 16, 8>
- Cycle 8: <3, 11, 15, 2>
- Cycle 9: <3, 9, 10, 7>
- Cycle 10: <3, 9, 19, 12>
- Cycle 11: <4, 16, 8, 3>
- Cycle 12: <4, 16, 11, 15>
- Cycle 13: <4, 18, 14, 18>
- Cycle 14: <5, 13, 2, 17>
- Cycle 15: <5, 17, 7, 0>
- Cycle 16: <7, 17, 2, 15>
- Cycle 17: <9, 16, 4, 18>
- Cycle 18: <9, 19, 12, 19>
- Cycle 19: <10, 7, 17, 3>
- Cycle 20: <11, 16, 8, 3>
- Cycle 21: <11, 18, 14, 18>
- Cycle 22: <13, 2, 15, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 1, 5, 13>, chord: (0, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 1, 15, 2>, chord: (1, 15)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, 9, 19, 12>, chord: (9, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 18, 14, 18>, chord: (18, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 13, 2, 17>, chord: (13, 17)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <7, 17, 2, 15>, chord: (17, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
As we found 6 chordal 4-cycles, the number of chordless cycles is [22].
