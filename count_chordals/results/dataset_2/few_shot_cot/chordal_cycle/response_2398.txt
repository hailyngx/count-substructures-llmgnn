Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is:
<3, (4, 6), 8>

To find the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph, follow the steps mentioned:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring every edge in the cycle exists:
- (0, 5, 7, 1) -> chordless
- (0, 5, 7, 2) -> chordless
- (0, 5, 3, 6) -> chordal with chord (4, 8)
- (1, 7, 5, 0) -> chordless
- (1, 7, 2, 3) -> chordless
- (1, 7, 5, 3) -> chordless
- (2, 3, 4, 6) -> chordless
- (2, 3, 1, 9) -> chordless
- (2, 3, 4, 0) -> chordal with chord (1, 7)
- (3, 1, 7, 5) -> chordless
- (3, 1, 9, 6) -> chordless
- (3, 1, 7, 2) -> chordless
- (4, 3, 6, 8) -> chordless
- (4, 3, 2, 1) -> chordless
- (4, 3, 6, 0) -> chordless
- (5, 0, 4, 6) -> chordless
- (5, 0, 6, 3) -> chordless
- (5, 0, 4, 9) -> chordal with chord (3, 6)
- (6, 4, 9, 8) -> chordless
- (6, 4, 0, 5) -> chordless
- (7, 1, 9, 6) -> chordless
- (7, 1, 3, 5) -> chordless
- (7, 1, 9, 8) -> chordal with chord (3, 6)
- (8, 6, 4, 0) -> chordless
- (8, 6, 0, 5) -> chordless
- (9, 8, 6, 0) -> chordless
- (9, 8, 0, 4) -> chordless
- (9, 8, 6, 3) -> chordal with chord (4, 0)

Step 2: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 21 chordless 4-cycles identified in the graph.

Therefore, the final count inside brackets is [21].
