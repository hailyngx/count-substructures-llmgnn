Response:
The total number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph can be counted as follows:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 2, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 13, 18, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 1, 9, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 1, 10, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 15, 4, 17, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 15, 19, 18, 0>
- Cycle 7: <2, 11, 19, 8, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 10, 12, 7, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 10, 14, 8, 2>
- Cycle 10: <3, 7, 12, 9, 3>
- Cycle 11: <3, 7, 8, 14, 3>
- Cycle 12: <4, 17, 5, 13, 4>
- Cycle 13: <4, 17, 3, 7, 4>
- Cycle 14: <5, 13, 18, 19, 5>
- Cycle 15: <5, 1, 9, 12, 5>
- Cycle 16: <5, 17, 4, 15, 5>
- Cycle 17: <7, 12, 10, 2, 7>
- Cycle 18: <8, 19, 18, 13, 8>
- Cycle 19: <8, 14, 10, 1, 8>
- Cycle 20: <9, 12, 10, 14, 9>
- Cycle 21: <11, 19, 18, 6, 11>
- Cycle 22: <15, 19, 18, 13, 15>

Step 2: Check for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has a chord: <0, (5, 18), 13>
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <0, (1, 9), 5>
- Cycle 4 has a chord: <0, (1, 10), 5>
- Cycle 5 has a chord: <0, (4, 17), 15>
- Cycle 6 has a chord: <0, (15, 19), 18>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <2, (11, 19), 8>
- Cycle 8 has a chord: <2, (10, 12), 7>
- Cycle 9 has a chord: <2, (10, 14), 8>
- Cycle 10 has a chord: <3, (7, 12), 9>
- Cycle 11 has a chord: <3, (8, 14), 7>
- Cycle 12 has no chord.
- Cycle 13 has no chord.
- Cycle 14 has no chord.
- Cycle 15 has a chord: <5, (1, 9), 12>
- Cycle 16 has a chord: <5, (4, 15), 17>
- Cycle 17 has a chord: <7, (10, 2), 12>
- Cycle 18 has a chord: <8, (18, 13), 19>
- Cycle 19 has a chord: <8, (10, 1), 14>
- Cycle 20 has no chord.
- Cycle 21 has a chord: <11, (18, 6), 19>
- Cycle 22 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:
- There are 15 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. 
  So, the final count is [15].
