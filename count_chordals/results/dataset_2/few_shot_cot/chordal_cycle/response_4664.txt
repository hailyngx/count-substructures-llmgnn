Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (9, 14) (4, 0) (4, 11) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 10) (3, 5) (3, 10) (3, 13) (3, 12) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 11) (8, 12) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 11) (14, 9) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 14) (2, 12) (2, 10) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 2) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 8) (11, 0) (11, 14) (10, 1) (10, 3) (10, 8) (10, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 13, 14, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 14, 12, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 10, 13, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 11, 6, and node 2

Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 11, 6, 14, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 10, 11, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 0, and node 14
Node 12 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 2
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 11, and node 2

Response:
After listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycle:

1. <0, 4, 11, 14> with chord (0, 11)

Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final number of chordless cycles is [0].
