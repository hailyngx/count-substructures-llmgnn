Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in this graph. Two of them are:
1. Cycle 1: (1, 5, 0, 4, 1)
2. Cycle 2: (8, 9, 4, 0, 8)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 1 has a chord (1, 4) which connects non-adjacent nodes 1 and 4.
2. Cycle 2 has a chord (9, 4) which connects non-adjacent nodes 9 and 4.

Step 3:
Count of unique chordal 4-cycles = [2]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (1, 4), 5, 0>
<2, (9, 4), 8, 0>
