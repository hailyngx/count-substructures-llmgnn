Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <0, 9, 6, 1> 
2. <0, 9, 12, 7>
3. <0, 9, 12, 4>
4. <0, 9, 12, 2>
5. <0, 6, 4, 7>
6. <0, 6, 4, 14>
7. <0, 6, 4, 1>
8. <0, 6, 1, 8>
9. <0, 6, 1, 2>
10. <0, 8, 1, 6>
11. <1, 6, 4, 7>
12. <1, 6, 4, 14>
13. <1, 6, 4, 12>
14. <1, 6, 4, 1>
15. <1, 6, 4, 6>
16. <1, 6, 0, 9>
17. <1, 6, 0, 8>
18. <1, 6, 0, 1>
19. <1, 6, 0, 6>
20. <1, 6, 4, 12>
21. <1, 8, 0, 9>
22. <1, 8, 9, 5>
23. <1, 8, 9, 12>
24. <1, 8, 9, 0>
25. <1, 8, 9, 6>
26. <2, 11, 7, 4>
27. <2, 11, 7, 12>
28. <2, 11, 7, 14>
29. <2, 11, 7, 11>
30. <2, 11, 7, 14>
31. <2, 11, 3, 10>
32. <2, 11, 3, 11>
33. <2, 11, 3, 14>
34. <2, 11, 3, 13>
35. <2, 11, 12, 4>
36. <2, 11, 12, 7>
37. <2, 11, 12, 2>
38. <2, 11, 12, 9>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 6, 1> has a chord (6, 1)
- <0, 6, 4, 7> has a chord (6, 7)
- <0, 6, 4, 14> has a chord (6, 14)
- <0, 6, 1, 8> has a chord (6, 8)
- <1, 6, 4, 7> has a chord (6, 7)
- <1, 6, 4, 14> has a chord (6, 14)
- <2, 11, 7, 4> has a chord (11, 4)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
Number of chordal 4-cycles (cycle with exactly one chord): [0]
