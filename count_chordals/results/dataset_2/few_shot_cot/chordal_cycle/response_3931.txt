Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 5, 1, 8, 2>
2. <0, 5, 1, 2, 4>
3. <0, 5, 6, 3, 9>
4. <0, 4, 2, 1, 5>
5. <0, 4, 2, 6, 5>
6. <0, 4, 6, 7, 3>
7. <0, 9, 3, 6, 4>
8. <0, 9, 3, 7, 5>
9. <1, 2, 4, 6, 5>
10. <1, 5, 7, 9, 3>
11. <1, 5, 8, 7, 6>
12. <2, 4, 6, 5, 1>
13. <3, 6, 4, 0, 5>
14. <3, 6, 5, 1, 9>
15. <3, 7, 5, 6, 4>
16. <3, 7, 6, 2, 8>
17. <4, 6, 5, 7, 9>
18. <5, 6, 7, 9, 1>
19. <5, 6, 7, 9, 3>
20. <6, 7, 5, 1, 2>
21. <6, 7, 8, 2, 4>
22. <7, 8, 2, 4, 6>
23. <9, 3, 6, 4, 0>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (forming a chordal 4-cycle) are:
1. <0, 5, 1, 8, 2> with chord (5, 8)
2. <1, 5, 8, 7, 6> with chord (5, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles, we have [21].
