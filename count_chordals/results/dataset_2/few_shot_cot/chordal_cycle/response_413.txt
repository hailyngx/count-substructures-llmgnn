Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 8, 9, 7>
- Cycle 4: <1, 4, 2, 5, 6>
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 9, 5, 6>
- Cycle 7: <2, 5, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle 9: <2, 4, 8, 9, 7>
- Cycle 10: <2, 4, 1, 6, 5>
- Cycle 11: <3, 7, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 12: <3, 7, 9, 5, 6>
- Cycle 13: <3, 8, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 14: <4, 8, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 15: <5, 9, 8, 6, 1>
- Cycle 16: <5, 9, 7, 3, 0>
- Cycle 17: <6, 5, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 18: <6, 5, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle 19: <6, 8, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 20: <7, 9, 8, 4, 1>

Step 2: 
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, 5, 9, 8, 4> with chord (5, 8)
2. <1, 4, 2, 5, 6> with chord (4, 5)
3. <1, 7, 9, 8, 4> with chord (7, 8)
4. <1, 7, 9, 5, 6> with chord (7, 5)
5. <2, 5, 9, 8, 4> with chord (2, 9)
6. <3, 7, 9, 8, 4> with chord (3, 8)

Step 3:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
