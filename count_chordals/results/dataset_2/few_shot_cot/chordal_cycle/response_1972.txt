Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 1, 3, 4, 0>
- <0, 1, 10, 2, 9, 5, 14, 7, 11, 0>
- <0, 1, 8, 14, 6, 2, 10, 12, 13, 0>
- <1, 3, 7, 14, 8, 6, 2, 10, 12, 13, 4, 0, 11, 5, 9, 2, 6, 1>
- <1, 3, 14, 8, 7, 11, 0, 4, 13, 12, 10, 2, 6, 1>
- <1, 6, 2, 9, 5, 14, 7, 3, 11, 0, 4, 13, 1>

Step 2: Identify the chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 1, 8, 14>
- <0, 1, 10, 2>
- <1, 3, 14, 8>
- <1, 6, 2, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are [4] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
