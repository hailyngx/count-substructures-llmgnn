Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are two cycles of length 4 in this graph:
1. Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 1 - 5
2. Cycle 2: 5 - 1 - 2 - 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Both cycles have exactly one chord. 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As there are no chordless cycles found, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<5, (1, 9), 5>
<5, (1, 2), 5>
