Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-4-9-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-2-7-6-3-1-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-2-9-8-6-7-2-1-4-0
- Cycle 4: 0-1-4-6-7-2-3-1

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 9) -> Non-chordal cycle
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (2, 3) -> Non-chordal cycle
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (9, 8) -> Non-chordal cycle
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (4, 6) -> Non-chordal cycle

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: None.
