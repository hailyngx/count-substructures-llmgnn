Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
After examining the graph provided and following the steps to count chordal 4-cycles, we find the following:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle: <1, 5, 3, 9, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 5, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 6, 2, 9, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 6, 8, 5, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 9, 3, 5, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 9, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle: <2, 6, 9, 3, 2>
- Cycle: <2, 6, 1, 5, 2>
- Cycle: <2, 9, 3, 5, 2>
- Cycle: <3, 5, 8, 4, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 7, 8, 5, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 9, 1, 6, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 9, 6, 1, 3>
- Cycle: <4, 5, 8, 6, 4>
- Cycle: <4, 8, 7, 3, 4>
- Cycle: <4, 8, 5, 1, 4>
- Cycle: <5, 8, 7, 3, 5>
- Cycle: <6, 9, 3, 7, 6>
- Cycle: <6, 9, 1, 5, 6>
- Cycle: <8, 5, 1, 6, 8>
- Cycle: <8, 6, 1, 5, 8>
- Cycle: <8, 7, 3, 9, 8>
- Cycle: <9, 1, 5, 3, 9>
- Cycle: <9, 3, 5, 1, 9>

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
- <1, 5, 4, 8, 1> has a chord (4, 8)
- <3, 7, 8, 5, 3> has a chord (7, 5)
- <4, 8, 7, 3, 4> has a chord (7, 4)
  
Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 5, 4, 8, 1>
- <3, 7, 8, 5, 3>
- <4, 8, 7, 3, 4>
