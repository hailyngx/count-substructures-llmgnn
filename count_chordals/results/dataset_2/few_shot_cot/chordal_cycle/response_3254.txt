Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle <0, 5, 10, 4>
2. Cycle <0, 5, 9, 4>
3. Cycle <0, 13, 14, 10>
4. Cycle <1, 9, 5, 10>
5. Cycle <1, 9, 4, 12>
6. Cycle <1, 3, 7, 13>
7. Cycle <1, 3, 9, 5>
8. Cycle <2, 3, 9, 5>
9. Cycle <2, 3, 7, 13>
10. Cycle <3, 9, 5, 10>
11. Cycle <3, 9, 4, 12>
12. Cycle <4, 9, 5, 10>
13. Cycle <5, 9, 4, 12>
14. Cycle <6, 5, 9, 4>
15. Cycle <6, 5, 10, 4>
16. Cycle <7, 1, 9, 5>
17. Cycle <7, 1, 3, 9>
18. Cycle <7, 1, 12, 4>
19. Cycle <7, 3, 9, 5>
20. Cycle <7, 3, 4, 12>
21. Cycle <10, 5, 9, 4>
22. Cycle <10, 5, 6, 7>
23. Cycle <10, 4, 12, 1>
24. Cycle <12, 1, 9, 5>
25. Cycle <13, 7, 3, 9>
26. Cycle <13, 7, 1, 9>
27. Cycle <13, 14, 10, 5>
28. Cycle <14, 13, 7, 3>
29. Cycle <14, 13, 0, 5>
30. Cycle <14, 13, 7, 6>

Now, let's identify the chordal 4-cycles:

1. Chordal 4-cycle <0, 5, 10, 4> with chord (5, 10)
2. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 5, 10> with chord (9, 10)
3. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 3, 7, 13> with chord (3, 7)
4. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 3, 9, 5> with chord (3, 9)
5. Chordal 4-cycle <2, 3, 7, 13> with chord (3, 7)
6. Chordal 4-cycle <5, 9, 4, 12> with chord (9, 12)
7. Chordal 4-cycle <6, 5, 9, 4> with chord (5, 9)
8. Chordal 4-cycle <7, 1, 9, 5> with chord (1, 9)
9. Chordal 4-cycle <7, 1, 12, 4> with chord (1, 12)
10. Chordal 4-cycle <10, 5, 6, 7> with chord (5, 6)
11. Chordal 4-cycle <10, 4, 12, 1> with chord (4, 12)
12. Chordal 4-cycle <13, 7, 1, 9> with chord (7, 9)
13. Chordal 4-cycle <14, 13, 0, 5> with chord (13, 5)

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [17].
