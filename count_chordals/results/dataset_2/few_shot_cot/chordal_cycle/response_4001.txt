Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <6, 9, 2, 8>. 

Let's verify this:
- Cycle <6, 9, 2, 8> has edges (6, 9), (9, 2), (2, 8), and (8, 6).
- The chord in this cycle is (9, 8), connecting non-adjacent nodes 9 and 8.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
