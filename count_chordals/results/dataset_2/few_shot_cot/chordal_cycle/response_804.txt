Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 15, 12, 9, 4>
2. <1, 9, 4, 19>
3. <2, 6, 13, 3>
4. <3, 13, 5, 17>
5. <4, 9, 12, 7>
6. <5, 17, 8, 19>

Step 2:
Checking for each cycle if it has exactly one chord:
1. <0, 15, 12, 9, 4> has no chord.
2. <1, 9, 4, 19> has no chord.
3. <2, 6, 13, 3> has no chord.
4. <3, 13, 5, 17> has chord (5, 17).
5. <4, 9, 12, 7> has chord (9, 12).
6. <5, 17, 8, 19> has chord (8, 17).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [3]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <0, 15, 12, 9, 4>
2. <1, 9, 4, 19>
3. <2, 6, 13, 3>
