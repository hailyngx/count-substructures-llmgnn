Response:
The chordal 4-cycle in the graph is as follows:

<0, 7, 16, 9> with a chord (0, 16) 

Following the steps mentioned earlier:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 2, 12>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 13, 3>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 16, 9>
- Cycle 4: <0, 13, 14, 8>
- Cycle 5: <0, 19, 15, 11>
- Cycle 6: <7, 1, 0, 8>
- Cycle 7: <7, 2, 12, 4>
- Cycle 8: <7, 13, 3, 17>
- Cycle 9: <7, 16, 6, 11>
- Cycle 10: <8, 0, 13, 14>
- Cycle 11: <8, 17, 3, 13>
- Cycle 12: <9, 4, 12, 2>
- Cycle 13: <9, 10, 6, 16>
- Cycle 14: <10, 9, 4, 12>
- Cycle 15: <10, 15, 19, 0>
- Cycle 16: <11, 15, 19, 12>
- Cycle 17: <11, 6, 10, 9>
- Cycle 18: <12, 2, 7, 0>
- Cycle 19: <12, 3, 13, 14>
- Cycle 20: <12, 4, 9, 16>
- Cycle 21: <13, 0, 7, 16>
- Cycle 22: <13, 3, 17, 8>
- Cycle 23: <13, 14, 8, 17>
- Cycle 24: <14, 8, 17, 3>
- Cycle 25: <14, 6, 11, 15>
- Cycle 26: <15, 10, 9, 4>
- Cycle 27: <15, 11, 6, 14>
- Cycle 28: <16, 18, 16, 6>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 16, 9> has a chord (0, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 27 chordless cycles. 

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
