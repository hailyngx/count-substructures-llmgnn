Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 5, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 9, 5, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 5, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 8, 2, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 8, 4, 0, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 8, 5, 1, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 4, 9, 14, 3>
- Cycle 8: <4, 9, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 9: <4, 9, 12, 11, 4>
- Cycle 10: <5, 9, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 11: <5, 9, 12, 11, 5>
- Cycle 12: <6, 9, 5, 8, 6>
- Cycle 13: <7, 13, 2, 8, 7>
- Cycle 14: <8, 5, 1, 12, 8>
- Cycle 15: <9, 14, 3, 4, 9>
- Cycle 16: <10, 8, 5, 1, 10>
- Cycle 17: <10, 8, 2, 7, 10>
- Cycle 18: <11, 4, 9, 12, 11>
- Cycle 19: <12, 9, 5, 1, 12>
- Cycle 20: <13, 5, 9, 14, 13>

Step 2: Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 4, 5, 1, (0, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 5, 9, 6, (1, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 5, 8, 2, (1, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, 8, 4, 0, (2, 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 8, 5, 1, (2, 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <3, 4, 9, 14, (3, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, 9, 6, 1, (4, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, 9, 12, 11, (4, 11)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <8, 5, 1, 12, (8, 12)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, 8, 5, 1, (10, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <10, 8, 2, 7, (10, 7)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <11, 4, 9, 12, (11, 12)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <12, 9, 5, 1, (12, 1)>

Step 3: Number of chordless cycles found = 20 - 13 = 7
Therefore, the final count is [7].
