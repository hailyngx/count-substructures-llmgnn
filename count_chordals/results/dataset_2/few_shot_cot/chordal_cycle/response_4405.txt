Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 19, 10)
- Cycle 2: (4, 9, 25, 6)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 25, 6)
- Cycle 4: (7, 17, 23, 29)
- Cycle 5: (12, 7, 17, 23)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <3, (15, 19), 10>
- <4, (9, 25), 6>
- <5, (9, 25), 6>
- <7, (17, 23), 29>
- <12, (7, 17), 23>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]
