Response:
Step 1: 
There is 1 cycle of length 4: (11, 5, 20, 1).
There are 2 cycles of length 5: (11, 5, 20, 3, 19) and (5, 20, 3, 6, 15).
There are 6 cycles of length 6: (11, 5, 20, 3, 6, 26) , <11, 5, 23, 18, 9, 7> , <11, 5, 29, 25, 21, 2> , <11, 5, 29, 25, 21, 8> , <11, 13, 5, 20, 3, 6> and <5, 23, 18, 9, 7, 16>.
There are 6 cycles of length 7: <11, 5, 20, 3, 6, 26, 24> , <11, 5, 29, 25, 21, 2, 28> , <11, 13, 5, 20, 3, 6, 24>, <5, 23, 18, 9, 7, 16, 4>, <5, 29, 25, 21, 2, 28, 4> and <18, 9, 7, 16, 4, 15, 6>. 
There are 10 cycles of length 8: <11, 5, 20, 3, 6, 26, 24, 17> , <11, 5, 20, 3, 6, 26, 25, 21> , <11, 5, 20, 3, 6, 15, 4, 16> , <11, 13, 5, 20, 3, 6, 26, 24>, <5, 23, 18, 9, 7, 16, 4, 1> , <5, 23, 18, 9, 7, 16, 4, 28> , <5, 29, 25, 21, 2, 28, 4, 16>, <18, 9, 7, 16, 4, 15, 6, 3>, <18, 23, 17, 24, 26, 6, 15, 4> and <16, 7, 9, 19, 12, 0, 21, 25>.
Therefore, there are 25 cycles of length 4 or more.

Step 2:
Among these cycles, there are the following chordal 4-cycles:
<11, (29, 25), 5, 20>, <18, (17, 24), 26, 6>.
Thus, there are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles.

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is 25 - 2 = 23.
The final answer is [23].
