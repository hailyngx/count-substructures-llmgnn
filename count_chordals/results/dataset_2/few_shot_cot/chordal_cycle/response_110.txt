Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: (4, 9, 5, 8, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 9, 2, 6, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 9, 1, 5, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 9, 1, 6, 4)
- Cycle 5: (0, 4, 9, 5, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 4, 9, 1, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 4, 7, 3, 0)
- Cycle 8: (1, 5, 9, 2, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 5, 3, 7, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 6, 2, 9, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 6, 0, 4, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 6, 0, 7, 1)
- Cycle 13: (2, 9, 5, 8, 2)
- Cycle 14: (2, 6, 0, 4, 2)
- Cycle 15: (3, 5, 9, 8, 3)
- Cycle 16: (3, 5, 1, 6, 3)
- Cycle 17: (3, 4, 7, 0, 3)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- <Cycle 1, (4, 8)>
- <Cycle 2, (4, 6)>
- <Cycle 3, (4, 5)>
- <Cycle 4, (4, 1)>
- <Cycle 5, (0, 5)>
- <Cycle 6, (0, 1)>
- <Cycle 7, (0, 7)>
- <Cycle 8, (1, 2)>
- <Cycle 9, (1, 7)>
- <Cycle 10, (1, 9)>
- <Cycle 11, (1, 4)>
- <Cycle 12, (1, 7)>
- <Cycle 13, (2, 8)>
- <Cycle 14, (2, 4)>
- <Cycle 15, (3, 8)>
- <Cycle 16, (3, 6)>
- <Cycle 17, (3, 7)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:

- There are 17 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final result is [17].
