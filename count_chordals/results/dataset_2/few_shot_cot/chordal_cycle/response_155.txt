Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (0, 13, 3, 12, 2, 4)
- (1, 7, 6, 10, 5, 2)
- (2, 10, 5, 11, 6, 7)
- (4, 9, 3, 12, 2, 5)
- (5, 11, 6, 7, 1, 9)
- (6, 7, 1, 9, 4, 11)
- (6, 7, 1, 9, 8, 12)
- (11, 4, 9, 8, 12, 2)

Step 2: 
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Only the cycle (6, 7, 1, 9, 4, 11) has exactly one chord 9-11.

Step 3: 
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <6, 7, 1, 9, 4, 11>
