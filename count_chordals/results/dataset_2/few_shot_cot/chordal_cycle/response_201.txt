Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycles of length 4:
1. <4, 7, 10, 5, 4>
2. <4, 8, 5, 1, 4>
3. <0, 8, 5, 1, 0>
4. <0, 3, 9, 6, 0>
5. <4, 12, 1, 6, 4>
6. <4, 13, 3, 9, 4>
7. <7, 10, 3, 9, 7>
8. <7, 14, 9, 6, 7>
9. <8, 14, 9, 6, 8>
10. <1, 14, 9, 6, 1>
11. <12, 1, 6, 9, 12>
12. <12, 4, 7, 10, 12>
13. <12, 13, 3, 9, 12>
14. <13, 4, 7, 10, 13>
15. <13, 12, 0, 3, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle:
<[7, 14, 9, 6], (7, 9)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
As there was only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [14].
