The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 in the given graph are as follows:
1. <0, 6, 4, 1>
2. <0, 6, 4, 5>
3. <0, 7, 4, 1>
4. <0, 7, 4, 5>
5. <0, 2, 6, 4>
6. <0, 2, 6, 5>
7. <0, 3, 9, 4>
8. <0, 3, 4, 5>
9. <1, 4, 5, 7>
10. <2, 6, 4, 7>
11. <3, 4, 7, 5>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle <0, 6, 4, 1> has a chord (4, 6), making it a chordal 4-cycle: <0, (4, 6), 1>
- Cycle <0, 6, 4, 5> has a chord (4, 6), making it a chordal 4-cycle: <0, (4, 6), 5>
- Cycle <0, 7, 4, 1> has a chord (4, 7), making it a chordal 4-cycle: <0, (4, 7), 1>
- Cycle <0, 7, 4, 5> has a chord (4, 7), making it a chordal 4-cycle: <0, (4, 7), 5>
- Cycle <0, 2, 6, 4> has a chord (2, 6), making it a chordal 4-cycle: <0, (2, 6), 4>
- Cycle <0, 2, 6, 5> has a chord (2, 6), making it a chordal 4-cycle: <0, (2, 6), 5>
- Cycle <0, 3, 9, 4> has a chord (3, 9), making it a chordal 4-cycle: <0, (3, 9), 4>
- Cycle <0, 3, 4, 5> has a chord (3, 4), making it a chordal 4-cycle: <0, (3, 4), 5>
- Cycle <1, 4, 5, 7> has a chord (4, 5), making it a chordal 4-cycle: <1, (4, 5), 7>
- Cycle <2, 6, 4, 7> has a chord (4, 6), making it a chordal 4-cycle: <2, (4, 6), 7>
- Cycle <3, 4, 7, 5> has a chord (4, 7), making it a chordal 4-cycle: <3, (4, 7), 5>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have 11 chordal 4-cycles in total.  
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [11].
