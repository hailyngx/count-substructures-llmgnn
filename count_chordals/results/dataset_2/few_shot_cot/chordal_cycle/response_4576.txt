Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <6, (1, 24), 5, 21>.

Following the steps provided, we identify this unique chordal 4-cycle:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
  - 0-6-1-24-0
  - 0-6-16-29-3-13-8-2-9-4-21-0
  - 0-6-16-25-15-17-15-25-18-10-7-5-21-0
  - 1-6-21-5-1
  - 2-11-4-21-5-8-13-3-29-16-6-1-14-12-8-2
  - 4-9-2-8-5-21-4
  - 5-7-19-27-23-20-16-6-0-14-12-8-5
  - 16-29-3-13-8-5-21-6-1-24-5-16

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
  - The cycle 0-6-1-24-0 has exactly one chord (edge 1-24), making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
  - Since we found one chordal 4-cycle, the final count is [1].
