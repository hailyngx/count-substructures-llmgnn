Step 2: Checking for choral 4-cycles:
- <1, 7, 11, 5> has a chord (7, 11)
- <1, 7, 11, 27> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <1, 7, 18, 14> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <1, 12, 15, 4> has a chord (12, 15)
- <1, 12, 21, 3> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <1, 14, 17, 3> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <1, 14, 18, 7> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <2, 19, 24, 11> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <2, 19, 24, 25> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <2, 19, 27, 11> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <2, 21, 3, 17> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <2, 21, 12, 15> has a chord (21, 12)
- <2, 21, 12, 1> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <2, 21, 12, 7> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <7, 14, 18, 17> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <11, 5, 20, 15> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <11, 5, 20, 10> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <11, 7, 18, 14> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <11, 7, 27, 6> is a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Counting chordal 4-cycles: 
There are 16 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [16].
