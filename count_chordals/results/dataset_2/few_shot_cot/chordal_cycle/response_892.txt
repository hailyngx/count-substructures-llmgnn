Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- <1, 7, 11, 4> has one chord: (1, 4)
- <1, 7, 10, 3> has one chord: (1, 3)
- <2, 13, 11, 4> has one chord: (2, 4)
- <3, 18, 11, 7> has one chord: (3, 7)
- <4, 17, 14, 0> has one chord: (4, 14)
- <5, 14, 0, 15> has one chord: (5, 15)
- <5, 19, 10, 13> has one chord: (5, 13)
- <8, 13, 11, 4> has one chord: (8, 4)
- <10, 7, 3, 9> has one chord: (10, 9)
- <11, 8, 13, 2> has one chord: (11, 2)
- <14, 0, 15, 1> has one chord: (14, 1)
- <15, 0, 14, 17> has one chord: (15, 17)
- <17, 18, 4, 11> has one chord: (17, 11)
- <18, 3, 10, 13> has one chord: (18, 13)
- <19, 5, 14, 17> has one chord: (19, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:

- Total number of chordal 4-cycles found = 15
Therefore, the final answer is [15].
