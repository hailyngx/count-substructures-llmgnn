Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 5, 6>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 3, 6>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 8, 2>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 8, 7>
- Cycle 5: <0, 3, 6, 9>
- Cycle 6: <0, 4, 5, 6>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 6, 5>
- Cycle 8: <1, 5, 6, 9>
- Cycle 9: <3, 6, 9, 4>
- Cycle 10: <4, 6, 5, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1: Chord <1, 6>
- Cycle 2: Chord <0, 6>
- Cycle 3: Chord <1, 8>
- Cycle 4: Chord <1, 8>
- Cycle 5: Chord <3, 6>
- Cycle 6: Chord <4, 5>
- Cycle 7: Chord <1, 6>
- Cycle 8: Chord <1, 9>
- Cycle 9: Chord <3, 9>
- Cycle 10: Chord <5, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 5 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final answer is [5].
