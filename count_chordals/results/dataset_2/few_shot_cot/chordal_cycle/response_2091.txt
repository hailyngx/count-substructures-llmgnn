Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<0, 14, 19, 12>
<0, 18, 15, 12>
<0, 12, 4, 5>
<0, 12, 19, 14>
<1, 9, 11, 7>
<2, 11, 7, 8>
<2, 11, 9, 1>
<2, 15, 12, 4>
<3, 6, 13, 4>
<3, 6, 2, 11>
<3, 18, 15, 12>
<4, 5, 10, 13>
<4, 8, 11, 7>
<4, 12, 0, 18>
<5, 10, 13, 17>
<5, 19, 9, 1>
<6, 3, 18, 15>
<6, 13, 17, 4>
<6, 2, 11, 7>
<7, 11, 9, 1>
<8, 4, 12, 19>
<8, 10, 5, 19>
<9, 1, 16, 11>
<9, 19, 14, 0>
<10, 5, 19, 9>
<10, 13, 17, 6>
<10, 2, 15, 12>
<11, 2, 6, 13>
<11, 9, 19, 14>
<12, 0, 14, 19>
<13, 17, 6, 2>
<13, 4, 8, 7>
<14, 0, 12, 15>
<15, 12, 4, 8>
<16, 1, 9, 19>
<17, 13, 4, 12>
<18, 3, 6, 13>
<19, 5, 10, 2>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
<2, 11, 7, 8> has one chord <9, 1>
<2, 11, 9, 1> has one chord <7, 8>
<3, 6, 13, 4> has one chord <17, 2>
<5, 10, 13, 17> has one chord <6, 2>
<8, 4, 12, 19> has one chord <0, 14>
<10, 5, 19, 9> has one chord <13, 17>
<13, 17, 6, 2> has one chord <4, 12>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: 
[6]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is 6.
