Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <0, 5, 9, 1, (0, 9)>  (Length: 4)
        - <0, 5, 9, 4, (0, 9)>  (Length: 4)
        - <0, 2, 4, 9, (0, 9)>  (Length: 4)
        - <0, 2, 4, 1, (0, 1)>  (Length: 4)
        - <0, 2, 1, 9, (0, 9)>  (Length: 4)
        - <0, 2, 1, 4, (0, 1)>  (Length: 4)
        - <1, 9, 4, 2, (1, 4)>  (Length: 4)
        - <1, 9, 4, 6, (1, 4)>  (Length: 4)
        - <1, 2, 4, 9, (1, 4)>  (Length: 4)
        - <1, 2, 4, 6, (1, 4)>  (Length: 4)
        - <2, 4, 9, 5, (2, 5)>  (Length: 4)
        - <2, 4, 9, 3, (2, 3)>  (Length: 4)
        - <2, 4, 1, 9, (2, 1)>  (Length: 4)
        - <2, 4, 1, 0, (2, 0)>  (Length: 4)
        - <2, 1, 9, 5, (2, 5)>  (Length: 4)
        - <2, 1, 9, 3, (2, 3)>  (Length: 4)
        - <3, 5, 9, 4, (3, 4)>  (Length: 4)
        - <3, 5, 9, 1, (3, 9)>  (Length: 4)
        - <4, 9, 5, 8, (4, 8)>  (Length: 4)
        - <4, 9, 6, 1, (4, 6)>  (Length: 4)
        - <5, 9, 4, 6, (5, 6)>  (Length: 4)
        - <5, 9, 1, 4, (5, 1)>  (Length: 4)
        - <5, 8, 4, 2, (5, 4)>  (Length: 4)
        - <5, 8, 4, 9, (5, 4)>  (Length: 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <0, 5, 9, 1, (0, 9)>  has 1 chord
        - <0, 5, 9, 4, (0, 9)>  has 1 chord
        - <0, 2, 4, 9, (0, 9)>  has 1 chord
        - <0, 2, 1, 4, (0, 1)>  has 1 chord
        - <1, 9, 4, 2, (1, 4)>  has 1 chord
        - <1, 9, 4, 6, (1, 4)>  has 1 chord
        - <2, 4, 9, 5, (2, 5)>  has 1 chord
        - <2, 4, 9, 3, (2, 3)>  has 1 chord
        - <2, 4, 1, 0, (2, 0)>  has 1 chord
        - <3, 5, 9, 4, (3, 4)>  has 1 chord
        - <3, 5, 9, 1, (3, 9)>  has 1 chord
        - <4, 9, 5, 8, (4, 8)>  has 1 chord
        - <5, 9, 1, 4, (5, 1)>  has 1 chord
        - <5, 8, 4, 9, (5, 4)>  has 1 chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [14]
