Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is <3, 5, 8, 9>. 
To count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph, we can follow the steps mentioned earlier:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph, such as (3, 5, 8, 1), (4, 8, 1, 14), (7, 0, 3, 9), etc.
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The cycle <3, 5, 8, 9> is the only cycle with exactly one chord.
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- The final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
