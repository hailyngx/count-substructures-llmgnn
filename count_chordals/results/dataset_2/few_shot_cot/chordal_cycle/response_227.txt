Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 6, 9, 5) with edges (5, 1), (1, 6), (6, 9), (9, 5), (5, 9)
- Cycle 2: (4, 6, 9, 5, 4) with edges (4, 6), (6, 9), (9, 5), (5, 4), (4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 9, 7, 0) with edges (0, 5), (5, 9), (9, 7), (7, 0), (0, 7)
- Cycle 4: (3, 7, 9, 6, 3) with edges (3, 7), (7, 9), (9, 6), (6, 3), (3, 5)
- Cycle 5: (8, 1, 5, 0, 8) with edges (8, 1), (1, 5), (5, 0), (0, 8), (8, 6)
- Cycle 6: (2, 9, 7, 3, 2) with edges (2, 9), (9, 7), (7, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 3 has no chords
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (3, 6)
- Cycle 5 has no chords
- Cycle 6 has no chords

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (1, 9), 6, 9, 5)>
- <2, (4, 9), 5, 9, 7)>
- <3, 7, 9, 6, (3, 6)>
