Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <1, 5, 2, 6, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 9, 4, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 5, 1, 7, 6, 2>
- Cycle 4: <2, 5, 9, 4, 2>
- Cycle 5: <3, 9, 4, 0, 3>
- Cycle 6: <4, 9, 5, 6, 4>
- Cycle 7: <5, 2, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 8: <5, 2, 6, 3, 9, 5>
- Cycle 9: <5, 9, 3, 8, 0, 4, 5>
- Cycle 10: <6, 5, 9, 3, 8, 2, 6>
- Cycle 11: <6, 7, 1, 2, 6>
- Cycle 12: <7, 6, 4, 9, 5, 7>
- Cycle 13: <8, 0, 3, 9, 5, 8>
- Cycle 14: <9, 4, 0, 8, 5, 1, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 5, 2, 6, 1> has chord (5, 2)
- <1, 5, 9, 4, 1> has chord (5, 4)
- <5, 2, 6, 3, 9, 5> has chord (2, 3)
- <5, 9, 3, 8, 0, 4, 5> has chord (3, 8)
- <6, 5, 9, 3, 8, 2, 6> has chord (5, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<2, 5, 1, 7, 6>
<2, 5, 9, 4, 2>
<3, 9, 4, 0, 3>
<4, 9, 5, 6, 4>
<5, 2, 4, 6, 5>
<6, 7, 1, 2, 6>
<7, 6, 4, 9, 5, 7>
<8, 0, 3, 9, 5, 8>
<9, 4, 0, 8, 5, 1, 9>
