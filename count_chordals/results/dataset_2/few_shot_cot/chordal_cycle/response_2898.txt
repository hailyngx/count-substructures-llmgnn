Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. Cycle: 0-13-10-2-0
2. Cycle: 2-6-9-7-2
3. Cycle: 3-10-9-5-3
4. Cycle: 4-6-9-5-4
5. Cycle: 5-9-7-13-5
6. Cycle: 7-9-6-4-7
7. Cycle: 8-5-3-12-8
8. Cycle: 10-9-1-12-10
9. Cycle: 13-7-9-4-13
10. Cycle: 14-8-5-9-14
11. Cycle: 9-1-12-14-9
12. Cycle: 2-10-13-7-2
13. Cycle: 3-1-12-14-3
14. Cycle: 4-9-10-11-4
15. Cycle: 5-2-6-4-5
16. Cycle: 6-9-4-0-6
17. Cycle: 7-13-0-14-7

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:
1. <0, (2, 13), 10>
2. <2, (6, 9), 7>
3. <3, (5, 9), 10>
4. <4, (5, 9), 6>
5. <5, (7, 9), 13>
6. <6, (4, 9), 7>
7. <8, (3, 5), 12>
8. <10, (1, 12), 9>
9. <13, (7, 9), 4>
10. <14, (8, 5), 9>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles = [10]
