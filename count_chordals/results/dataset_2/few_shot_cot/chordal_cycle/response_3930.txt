Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 9, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 4, 5, 7, 3, 0> with 5 edges
2. <1, 3, 7, 5, 1> with 5 edges
3. <1, 3, 0, 4, 1> with 4 edges
4. <1, 6, 2, 5, 1> with 4 edges
5. <1, 6, 0, 4, 1> with 4 edges
6. <1, 9, 2, 5, 1> with 4 edges
7. <1, 9, 6, 5, 1> with 4 edges
8. <1, 9, 3, 7, 1> with 4 edges
9. <2, 6, 1, 3, 2> with 4 edges
10. <2, 6, 5, 7, 2> with 4 edges
11. <3, 7, 5, 2, 3> with 4 edges
12. <3, 8, 1, 6, 3> with 4 edges
13. <3, 8, 1, 9, 3> with 4 edges
14. <5, 7, 3, 0, 5> with 4 edges
15. <6, 1, 3, 0, 6> with 4 edges
16. <6, 2, 5, 7, 6> with 4 edges
17. <6, 9, 1, 0, 6> with 4 edges
18. <9, 7, 3, 0, 9> with 4 edges
19. <9, 2, 6, 1, 9> with 4 edges

Step 2: 
- The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<1, (3, 9), 7>

Step 3:
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
