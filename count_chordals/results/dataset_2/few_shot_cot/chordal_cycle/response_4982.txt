Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 2, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 2, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 1, 7, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 0, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle 6: <9, 5, 1, 7, 4, 9>
- Cycle 7: <9, 5, 2, 4, 7, 9>
- Cycle 8: <9, 0, 5, 1, 7, 9>
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 2, 5, 9, 4>
- Cycle 10: <4, 6, 1, 5, 9, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 3, 7, 2, 5, 4>
- Cycle 12: <7, 4, 6, 1, 5, 7>
- Cycle 13: <7, 3, 4, 9, 5, 7>
- Cycle 14: <7, 2, 5, 1, 6, 7>
- Cycle 15: <6, 5, 2, 7, 1, 6>
- Cycle 16: <6, 9, 4, 7, 1, 6>
- Cycle 17: <6, 1, 3, 7, 4, 6>
- Cycle 18: <1, 5, 0, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle 19: <1, 7, 4, 3, 6, 1>
- Cycle 20: <1, 3, 4, 7, 2, 1>
- Cycle 21: <3, 4, 7, 6, 1, 3>
- Cycle 22: <3, 7, 2, 5, 1, 3>
- Cycle 23: <8, 5, 2, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle 24: <0, 5, 1, 6, 9, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Only Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 5> has one chord, (5, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless 4-cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
