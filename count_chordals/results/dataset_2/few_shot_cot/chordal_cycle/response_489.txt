- Cycle 41: <29, 0, 20, 27, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 20, (6), 25, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 25, (19), 23, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <18, 17, 12, (26), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <18, 24, 5, (2), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <23, 19, (25), 1, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- The number of chordless cycles = 41 - 5 = 36

Therefore, the final answer is [36].
