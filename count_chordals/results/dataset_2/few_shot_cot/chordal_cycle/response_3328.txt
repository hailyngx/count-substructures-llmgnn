Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 9) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 0, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 0, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 4 - 1 - 6 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 2: 7 - 4 - 1 - 5 - 7
- Cycle 3: 0 - 4 - 1 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 4: 6 - 4 - 1 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 5: 8 - 7 - 4 - 9 - 8
- Cycle 6: 3 - 6 - 4 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 7: 2 - 7 - 4 - 1 - 2
- Cycle 8: 9 - 7 - 4 - 6 - 9
- Cycle 9: 8 - 7 - 2 - 3 - 8
- Cycle 10: 0 - 8 - 7 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 11: 2 - 7 - 9 - 0 - 2
- Cycle 12: 3 - 6 - 0 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 13: 5 - 1 - 0 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 14: 5 - 6 - 0 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 15: 6 - 0 - 8 - 9 - 6

Step 2:
The only cycle with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) is Cycle 7: 2 - 7 - 4 - 1 - 2
The chord in Cycle 7 is (4, 1).

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <7, (4, 1)>
