Response:
There are [1] chordal 4-cycle in the given graph:
<0, 11, 19, 12>

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 19, 12, 3, 13, 1, 10>
- Cycle 2: <0, 11, 19, 12, 4, 6, 1, 10>
- Cycle 3: <0, 16, 5, 4, 12, 19, 11, 15>
- Cycle 4: <0, 16, 9, 13, 3, 12, 19, 11>
- Cycle 5: <0, 16, 18, 12, 4, 6, 1, 10>
- Cycle 6: <0, 16, 2, 6, 1, 10, 13, 3>
- Cycle 7: <11, 0, 16, 5, 4, 12, 19, 11>
- Cycle 8: <11, 0, 16, 9, 13, 3, 12, 19>
- Cycle 9: <11, 19, 12, 4, 6, 1, 10, 2>
- Cycle 10: <11, 19, 12, 3, 13, 1, 10, 2>
- Cycle 11: <16, 0, 11, 19, 12, 4, 6, 1>
- Cycle 12: <16, 0, 11, 15, 8, 9, 13, 3>
- Cycle 13: <16, 0, 14, 5, 4, 12, 19, 11>
- Cycle 14: <16, 0, 14, 5, 4, 12, 3, 13>
- Cycle 15: <16, 0, 14, 5, 4, 6, 1, 10>
- Cycle 16: <16, 18, 12, 4, 6, 1, 10, 2>
- Cycle 17: <16, 18, 12, 3, 13, 1, 10, 2>
- Cycle 18: <16, 9, 13, 1, 10, 2, 6, 4>
- Cycle 19: <19, 12, 3, 13, 9, 8, 15, 11>
- Cycle 20: <19, 12, 4, 6, 1, 10, 2, 16>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 11, 19, 12> has exactly one chord, which is the edge between nodes 11 and 19.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is [1].
