Response:
Following the steps provided, let's find the number of chordless 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 13, 11, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 13, 12, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 11, 4, 12, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 11, 5, 12, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 5, 12, 4, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 5, 12, 13, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 8, 9, 2, 0>
- Cycle 8: <0, 8, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle 9: <0, 8, 10, 4, 0>
- Cycle 10: <0, 8, 10, 13, 0>
- Cycle 11: <1, 6, 10, 13, 1>
- Cycle 12: <2, 9, 3, 5, 2>
- Cycle 13: <2, 9, 6, 13, 2>
- Cycle 14: <2, 12, 4, 10, 2>
- Cycle 15: <3, 5, 11, 4, 3>
- Cycle 16: <4, 10, 13, 12, 4>
- Cycle 17: <6, 9, 14, 10, 6>
- Cycle 18: <7, 8, 10, 13, 7>
- Cycle 19: <7, 13, 12, 4, 7>
- Cycle 20: <8, 9, 6, 13, 8>
- Cycle 21: <8, 10, 4, 12, 8>
- Cycle 22: <11, 0, 8, 10, 11>
- Cycle 23: <11, 5, 3, 9, 11>
- Cycle 24: <11, 5, 12, 13, 11>
- Cycle 25: <12, 4, 10, 14, 12>
- Cycle 26: <12, 5, 3, 9, 12>
- Cycle 27: <13, 6, 9, 2, 13>
- Cycle 28: <13, 10, 4, 12, 13>

Step 2: Checking for chords:
- Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 7, 13, 11, 0> (Chord: (0, 11))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There is 27 chordless 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordless 4-cycles in the given graph is [27].
