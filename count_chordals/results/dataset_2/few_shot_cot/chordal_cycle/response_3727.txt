Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Found 5 cycles with exactly one chord: 
    - <Cycle 1, edge (0, 4)>
    - <Cycle 6, edge (1, 7)>
    - <Cycle 9, edge (2, 5)>
    - <Cycle 14, edge (4, 13)>
    - <Cycle 17, edge (5, 11)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [5]
