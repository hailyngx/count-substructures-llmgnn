Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: 
We can see that there are two cycles of length 4 in the graph: (4, 1, 0, 7) and (3, 4, 6, 8).

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle (4, 1, 0, 7) does not have any chords.
- Cycle (3, 4, 6, 8) has exactly one chord, which is edge (3, 8).

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<3, (3, 8), 4, 6>
