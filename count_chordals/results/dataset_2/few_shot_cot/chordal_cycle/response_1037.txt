Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 1, 3, 10, 4>
- <0, 4, 14, 12, 3>
- <0, 4, 13, 11, 8>
- <0, 1, 5, 7, 6>
- <1, 3, 2, 12, 14>
- <1, 5, 7, 6, 11>
- <3, 6, 7, 5, 1>
- <4, 10, 5, 7, 0>
- <4, 13, 11, 8, 9>

Step 2: Identifying the chordal 4-cycle:
- The cycle <0, 1, 3, 10, 4> has a chord 4 - 10.
- The cycle <0, 4, 13, 11, 8> has a chord 11 - 13.
- The cycle <4, 10, 5, 7, 0> has a chord 0 - 5.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 1, 3, 10, 4> (Chord: 4 - 10)
- <0, 4, 13, 11, 8> (Chord: 11 - 13)
- <4, 10, 5, 7, 0> (Chord: 0 - 5)
