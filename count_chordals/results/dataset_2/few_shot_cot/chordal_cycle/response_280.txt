Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <0, 29, 5, 7> has one chord: (29, 5)
- Cycle 2 <0, 26, 4, 27> has one chord: (26, 4)
- Cycle 3 <1, 11, 23, 17> has one chord: (11, 17)
- Cycle 4 <1, 16, 3, 27> has one chord: (16, 27)
- Cycle 5 <1, 10, 17, 27> has one chord: (10, 27)
- Cycle 6 <1, 7, 28, 20> has one chord: (28, 20)
- Cycle 7 <1, 10, 23, 11> has one chord: (10, 23)
- Cycle 21 <10, 23, 22, 14> has one chord: (23, 22)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 30 cycles in total, 7 of them have exactly one chord.
Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [23]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <10, 23, 22, 14>.
