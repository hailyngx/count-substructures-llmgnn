Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 5, 10, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 9, 14, 7, 4, 12, 6, 3, 1, 2, 10, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 2, 10, 7, 4, 12, 6, 13, 12, 4, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 10, 7, 4, 12, 6, 13, 7, 14, 3, 5, 8, 0>
- Cycle 5: <3, 1, 2, 10, 7, 14, 9, 8, 5, 3>
- Cycle 6: <4, 12, 8, 5, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle 7: <5, 8, 9, 14, 13, 6, 12, 4, 7, 10, 5>
- Cycle 8: <6, 12, 13, 7, 10, 0, 8, 5, 3, 6>
- Cycle 9: <7, 10, 2, 1, 4, 12, 6, 13, 7>
- Cycle 10: <9, 8, 0, 11, 14, 7, 4, 12, 6, 9>
- Cycle 11: <11, 3, 14, 9, 8, 0, 10, 2, 1, 11>
- Cycle 12: <13, 12, 6, 3, 5, 10, 7, 14, 13>

Step 2: Check for chords in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycles:
  <0, 8, 5, 10, 0> with chord (8, 10)
  <2, 10, 7, 4, 12, 6, 13, 7, 14, 3, 5, 8, 0> with chord (7, 5)
  <3, 1, 2, 10, 7, 14, 9, 8, 5, 3> with chord (10, 3)
  <7, 10, 2, 1, 4, 12, 6, 13, 7> with chord (7, 1)
  <9, 8, 0, 11, 14, 7, 4, 12, 6, 9> with chord (9, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are [5] chordal 4-cycles.
