The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 0: 0 - 5 - 4 - 7 - 0
- Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 7 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 9 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 3: 2 - 3 - 8 - 2
- Cycle 4: 3 - 5 - 7 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 5: 3 - 2 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 6: 4 - 5 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 7: 5 - 4 - 0 - 5
- Cycle 8: 6 - 9 - 1 - 6
- Cycle 9: 7 - 5 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 10: 8 - 9 - 1 - 3 - 8
- Cycle 11: 9 - 6 - 1 - 9

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 0: 0 - 5 - 4 - 7 - 0 (Chord: 5-7)
- Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 7 - 5 - 0 (Chord: 4-7)
- Cycle 2: 1 - 9 - 6 - 1 (No chord)
- Cycle 3: 2 - 3 - 8 - 2 (No chord)
- Cycle 4: 3 - 5 - 7 - 8 - 3 (No chord)
- Cycle 5: 3 - 2 - 8 - 3 (No chord)
- Cycle 6: 4 - 5 - 7 - 4 (Chord: 5-7)
- Cycle 7: 5 - 4 - 0 - 5 (No chord)
- Cycle 8: 6 - 9 - 1 - 6 (No chord)
- Cycle 9: 7 - 5 - 4 - 7 (Chord: 5-7)
- Cycle 10: 8 - 9 - 1 - 3 - 8 (No chord)
- Cycle 11: 9 - 6 - 1 - 9 (No chord)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found. 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <0, 5-7, 4>
2. <0, 4-7, 5>
3. <7, 5-7, 4>
