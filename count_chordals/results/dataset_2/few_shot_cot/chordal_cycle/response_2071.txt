Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 14, 9, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 14, 2, 11, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 11, 8, 7, 2>
- Cycle 4: <3, 6, 9, 4, 3>
- Cycle 5: <4, 7, 8, 11, 4>
- Cycle 6: <5, 13, 3, 6, 5>
- Cycle 7: <6, 7, 4, 12, 6>
- Cycle 8: <7, 8, 1, 10, 7>
- Cycle 9: <8, 11, 2, 6, 8>
- Cycle 10: <9, 6, 7, 4, 9>
- Cycle 11: <10, 3, 13, 5, 10>
- Cycle 12: <11, 1, 0, 13, 11>
- Cycle 13: <12, 4, 9, 0, 12>
- Cycle 14: <13, 5, 12, 14, 13>
- Cycle 15: <14, 8, 7, 6, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Only Cycle 6: <5, 13, 3, 6, 5> has exactly one chord, which is the edge (3, 13).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the count is [1].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, (3, 13), 6)>.
