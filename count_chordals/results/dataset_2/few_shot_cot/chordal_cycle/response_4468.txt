Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 are: <0, 5, 1, 3, 0>, <0, 1, 4, 9, 5>, <0, 3, 6, 9, 5>, <1, 4, 9, 6, 3, 1>, <2, 4, 9, 6, 3, 2>, <2, 9, 6, 3, 1, 2>, <2, 1, 0, 5, 2>, <5, 9, 6, 3, 8, 5>, <5, 7, 9, 6, 3, 8, 5>, <7, 5, 9, 6, 3, 8, 7>
  
Step 2:
- The cycles with exactly one chord are: <<0, 5, 1, 4, 9, 0> (3, 6)>, <0, 3, 6, 9, 5, 0 (1, 4)>, <1, 4, 9, 6, 3, 1 (0, 5)>, <<2, 1, 4, 9, 6, 2> (3, 0)>, <<2, 9, 6, 3, 1, 2> (0, 5)>, <5, 9, 6, 3, 8, 5 (0, 7)>

Step 3:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles is [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 5, 1, 4, 9> with chord (3, 6)
- <0, 3, 6, 9, 5> with chord (1, 4)
- <1, 4, 9, 6, 3> with chord (0, 5)
- <2, 1, 4, 9, 6> with chord (3, 0)
- <2, 9, 6, 3, 1> with chord (0, 5)
- <5, 9, 6, 3, 8> with chord (0, 7)
