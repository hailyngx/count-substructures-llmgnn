The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
1. <0, 5, 2, 9, 1>
2. <0, 2, 9, 6, 5>
3. <1, 9, 6, 5, 3>
4. <1, 9, 6, 7, 4>
5. <1, 3, 6, 5, 8>
6. <1, 7, 6, 5, 8>
7. <2, 9, 6, 7, 4>
8. <3, 6, 5, 8, 2>
9. <4, 9, 2, 5, 8>
10. <5, 6, 7, 9, 4>
11. <5, 8, 2, 9, 1>

Step 2: 
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <0, 5, (2, 9), 1>
2. <0, (2, 9), 6, 5>
3. <1, 9, 6, (5, 3)>
4. <1, 9, (6, 7), 4>
5. <1, 3, 6, 5, 8>
6. <1, 7, 6, 5, 8>
7. <2, 9, (6, 7), 4>
8. <3, 6, 5, 8, 2>
9. <4, 9, (2, 5), 8>
10. <5, 6, 7, 9, 4>
11. <5, 8, 2, 9, 1>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [11]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
1. <0, 5, (2, 9), 1>
2. <1, 9, 6, (5, 3)>
3. <1, 9, (6, 7), 4>
4. <3, 6, 5, 8, 2>
5. <4, 9, (2, 5), 8>
6. <5, 6, 7, 9, 4>
