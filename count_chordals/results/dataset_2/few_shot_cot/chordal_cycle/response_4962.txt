Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with all existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (8, 17, 22, 20, 25, 9, 18, 2, 7, 3, 20) with edges (8, 17), (17, 22), (22, 20), (20, 25), (25, 9), (9, 18), (18, 2), (2, 7), (7, 3), (3, 20), (20, 22)
- Cycle 2: (8, 17, 22, 20, 25, 19, 14, 13, 10, 9, 18) with edges (8, 17), (17, 22), (22, 20), (20, 25), (25, 19), (19, 14), (14, 13), (13, 10), (10, 9), (9, 18), (18, 8)
- Cycle 3: (2, 18, 9, 25, 20, 22, 17, 11, 21, 12, 2) with edges (2, 18), (18, 9), (9, 25), (25, 20), (20, 22), (22, 17), (17, 11), (11, 21), (21, 12), (12, 2), (2, 18)
- Cycle 4: (2, 18, 9, 4, 13, 27, 29, 16, 26, 29) with edges (2, 18), (18, 9), (9, 4), (4, 13), (13, 27), (27, 29), (29, 16), (16, 26), (26, 29), (29, 18), (18, 2)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for a chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 25).
- Cycle 2 has a chord (10, 9).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (11, 21).
- Cycle 4 has a chord (13, 27).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [4].
Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
- <8, 17, 22, 20>
- <8, 17, 22, 20, 25>
- <2, 18, 9, 25, 20, 22>
- <2, 18, 9, 4, 13, 27>
