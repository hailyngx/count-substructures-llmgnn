Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 10, 9>
- Cycle 2: <1, 7, 2, 13>
- Cycle 3: <3, 13, 9, 4>
- Cycle 4: <5, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 5: <12, 11, 8, 4>
- Cycle 6: <12, 3, 13, 5>
- Cycle 7: <13, 9, 0, 6>
- Cycle 8: <13, 9, 4, 14>
  
Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (6, 10), 9> (Chord: 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (7, 2), 13> (Chord: 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (13, 9), 4> (Chord: 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, (6, 1), 7> (Chord: 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <12, (11, 8), 4> (Chord: 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <12, (3, 13), 5> (Chord: 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <13, (9, 0), 6> (Chord: 0)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <13, (9, 4), 14> (Chord: 9)
  
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are a total of [0] chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
