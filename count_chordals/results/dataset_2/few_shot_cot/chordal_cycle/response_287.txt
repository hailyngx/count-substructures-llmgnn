Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
  - Cycle 1: <5, 9, 7, 1, 5>
  - Cycle 2: <10, 11, 7, 9, 10>
  - Cycle 3: <12, 11, 9, 5, 12>
  - Cycle 4: <3, 2, 8, 13, 3>
  - Cycle 5: <6, 4, 7, 9, 6>
  - Cycle 6: <0, 10, 11, 14, 0>
  - Cycle 7: <14, 5, 9, 13, 14>
  - Cycle 8: <1, 5, 8, 7, 1>
  - Cycle 9: <14, 6, 3, 2, 0, 14>
  - Cycle 10: <12, 14, 11, 7, 4, 6, 12>

Step 2:
- Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
  - Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (7, 1)
  - Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (9, 10)
  - Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (9, 5)
  - Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (8, 13)
  - Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (7, 9)
  - Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (11, 14)
  - Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (11, 9)
  - Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (5, 8)
  - Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (3, 2)
  - Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (14, 11)

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
