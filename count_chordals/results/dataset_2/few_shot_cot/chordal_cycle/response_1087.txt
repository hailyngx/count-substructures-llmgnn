Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 3, 4>
- Cycle 2: <5, 1, 6, 4>
- Cycle 3: <5, 1, 11, 4>
- Cycle 4: <5, 14, 10, 7>
- Cycle 5: <5, 14, 0, 3>
- Cycle 6: <5, 14, 2, 6>
- Cycle 7: <8, 1, 6, 4>
- Cycle 8: <8, 1, 11, 4>
- Cycle 9: <8, 1, 5, 14>
- Cycle 10: <8, 4, 3, 0>
- Cycle 11: <8, 4, 11, 14>
- Cycle 12: <8, 5, 14, 0>
- Cycle 13: <8, 5, 12, 2>
- Cycle 14: <0, 3, 1, 5>
- Cycle 15: <0, 3, 4, 8>
- Cycle 16: <0, 14, 2, 6>
- Cycle 17: <0, 14, 10, 7>
- Cycle 18: <7, 10, 11, 4>
- Cycle 19: <7, 8, 4, 11>
- Cycle 20: <7, 8, 5, 14>
- Cycle 21: <7, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle 22: <9, 1, 5, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <<5, 14, 2, 6>, (5, 2)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 22 cycles listed above, and the unique chordal 4-cycle is found. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [21].
