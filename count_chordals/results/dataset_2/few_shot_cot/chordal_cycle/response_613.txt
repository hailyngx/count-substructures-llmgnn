Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 2: <1, 7, 14, 2>
- Cycle 3: <2, 14, 4, 13>
- Cycle 4: <3, 12, 7, 6>
- Cycle 5: <4, 13, 8, 9>
- Cycle 6: <5, 9, 7, 6>
- Cycle 7: <6, 0, 11, 5>
- Cycle 8: <7, 1, 2, 14>
- Cycle 9: <8, 13, 4, 14>
- Cycle 10: <9, 7, 12, 3>
- Cycle 11: <10, 3, 9, 5>
- Cycle 12: <11, 0, 6, 1>
- Cycle 13: <12, 3, 9, 7>
- Cycle 14: <13, 8, 11, 0>
- Cycle 15: <14, 2, 1, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 7> has a chord (6, 1)
- Cycle 3: <2, 14, 4, 13> has a chord (14, 4)
- Cycle 7: <6, 0, 11, 5> has a chord (0, 5)
- Cycle 8: <7, 1, 2, 14> has a chord (1, 14)
- Cycle 10: <9, 7, 12, 3> has a chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 12: <11, 0, 6, 1> has a chord (0, 6)
- Cycle 13: <12, 3, 9, 7> has a chord (3, 9)
- Cycle 15: <14, 2, 1, 6> has a chord (2, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 15 cycles found, and 7 of them have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <0, 6, 1, 7> with chord (6, 1)
- <2, 14, 4, 13> with chord (14, 4)
- <6, 0, 11, 5> with chord (0, 5)
- <7, 1, 2, 14> with chord (1, 14)
- <9, 7, 12, 3> with chord (7, 3)
- <11, 0, 6, 1> with chord (0, 6)
- <12, 3, 9, 7> with chord (3, 9)
- <14, 2, 1, 6> with chord (2, 6)
