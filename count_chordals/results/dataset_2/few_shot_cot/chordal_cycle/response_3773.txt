Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 5) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 5, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
<0, 6, 1, 4> (cycle length 4)
<0, 6, 1, 2> (cycle length 4)
<0, 6, 1, 9> (cycle length 4)
<0, 6, 7, 3> (cycle length 4)
<0, 9, 3, 8> (cycle length 4)
<1, 6, 9, 3> (cycle length 4)
<1, 6, 4, 2> (cycle length 4)
<1, 2, 4, 6> (cycle length 4)
<2, 4, 6, 0> (cycle length 4)
<3, 9, 6, 0> (cycle length 4)
<3, 9, 1, 2> (cycle length 4)
<3, 9, 1, 6> (cycle length 4)
<7, 6, 1, 4> (cycle length 4)
<7, 6, 1, 2> (cycle length 4)
<7, 6, 1, 9> (cycle length 4)
<7, 0, 6, 9> (cycle length 4)
<7, 0, 6, 1> (cycle length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
The chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<<0, 6, 1, 4>, (2, 8)> (chord connecting 2 and 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
