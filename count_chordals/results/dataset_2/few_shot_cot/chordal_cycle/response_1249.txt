Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 14) (3, 5) (0, 14) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 8) (14, 9) (14, 4) (11, 1) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 11) (5, 13) (5, 7) (13, 5) (13, 10) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 6) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 2) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 6) (12, 9) (6, 13) (6, 4) (6, 12) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 12) (10, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 13) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (9, 14) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 10) (9, 2)

Node 6 is connected to node 13, 4, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 5, 13, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 14, 11, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 14, 13, 12, 10, and node 2
Node 10 is connected to node 13, 4, 12, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 11, 4, 10, 6, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 10, 9, 7, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 0, 8, 9, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: 

There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. <0, 14, 4, 2>
2. <1, 3, 5, 7>
3. <1, 5, 13, 10>
4. <1, 11, 8, 14>
5. <2, 4, 12, 6>
6. <3, 1, 11, 5>
7. <3, 5, 13, 7>
8. <3, 7, 2, 9>
9. <4, 14, 8, 11>
10. <4, 12, 10, 6>
11. <5, 1, 11, 8>
12. <5, 3, 7, 13>
13. <6, 13, 7, 2>
14. <8, 11, 12, 9>
15. <9, 14, 4, 10>

Step 2:

There are two unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, 3, 5, 7> with a chord 13
2. <8, 11, 12, 9> with a chord 4

Step 3:

The number of chordless 4-cycles found is `[13]`.
