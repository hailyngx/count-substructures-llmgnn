Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in this graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <1, 4, 7, 9>
- Cycle 2: <1, 2, 9, 5>
- Cycle 3: <1, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 4: <3, 2, 9, 5>
- Cycle 5: <3, 8, 5, 9>
- Cycle 6: <6, 0, 1, 7>
- Cycle 7: <6, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 8: <6, 7, 1, 5>
- Cycle 9: <6, 8, 5, 9>
- Cycle 10: <6, 8, 3, 5>
- Cycle 11: <0, 1, 5, 9>
- Cycle 12: <0, 1, 7, 9>
- Cycle 13: <0, 6, 7, 4>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the following ones have exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 2, 9, 5> with chord (1, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, 8, 5, 9> with chord (3, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, 8, 3, 5> with chord (6, 3)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 6, 7, 4> with chord (0, 7)

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
