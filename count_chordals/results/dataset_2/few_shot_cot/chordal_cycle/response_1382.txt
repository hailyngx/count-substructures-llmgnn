Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
[1]

<6, 7, (1, 8)>
Explanation: The 4-cycle 6-7-1-8 has the chord 1 connecting non-adjacent nodes.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
