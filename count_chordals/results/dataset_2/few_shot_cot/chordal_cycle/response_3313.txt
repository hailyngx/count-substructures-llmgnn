Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

From the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (2, 6), 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 59 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [59].
