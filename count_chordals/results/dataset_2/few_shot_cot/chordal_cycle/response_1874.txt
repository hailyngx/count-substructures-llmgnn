Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        
Cycles of length 4:
1. (10, 11, 12, 7, 10)
2. (10, 14, 13, 15, 10)
3. (11, 18, 4, 9, 11)
4. (16, 4, 18, 11, 16)
5. (16, 4, 17, 5, 16)
6. (16, 4, 18, 1, 16)
7. (16, 1, 18, 11, 16)
8. (16, 1, 18, 4, 16)
9. (16, 1, 7, 10, 16)
10. (16, 1, 7, 2, 16)
11. (16, 1, 18, 11, 16)
12. (16, 19, 17, 4, 16)
13. (16, 19, 11, 10, 16)
14. (16, 19, 17, 5, 16)
15. (16, 19, 11, 18, 16)
16. (16, 19, 11, 12, 16)
17. (16, 6, 15, 13, 16)
18. (16, 6, 15, 9, 16)
19. (16, 6, 5, 17, 16)
20. (16, 6, 5, 8, 16)
21. (16, 4, 9, 15, 16)
22. (16, 1, 18, 4, 16)
23. (19, 17, 4, 18, 19)
24. (19, 11, 18, 1, 19)
25. (19, 16, 1, 18, 19)
26. (19, 16, 4, 17, 19)
27. (19, 16, 4, 18, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <16, (1, 18), 11, 16>
2. <16, (4, 17), 5, 16>
3. <16, (6, 15), 13, 16>
4. <16, (19, 17), 4, 16>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
        
There are [4] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
