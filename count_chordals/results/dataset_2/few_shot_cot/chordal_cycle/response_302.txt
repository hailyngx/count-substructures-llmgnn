Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph. Let's list them out:
1. Cycle: 0-5-1-4-0
2. Cycle: 0-5-9-4-0
3. Cycle: 0-7-5-1-0
4. Cycle: 0-7-4-1-0
5. Cycle: 0-7-6-2-0
6. Cycle: 1-5-9-4-1
7. Cycle: 1-5-0-7-1
8. Cycle: 2-5-9-3-2
9. Cycle: 3-2-6-8-3
10. Cycle: 4-9-5-7-4
11. Cycle: 6-7-0-5-6
12. Cycle: 6-7-5-9-6
13. Cycle: 6-8-9-5-6
14. Cycle: 7-5-9-4-7
15. Cycle: 8-9-5-1-8

Step 2:
Let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 0-5-1-4-0 has the chord (5, 4)
- Cycle 0-5-9-4-0 has the chord (5, 4)
- Cycle 0-7-5-1-0 has the chord (7, 1)
- Cycle 0-7-4-1-0 has the chord (7, 1)
- Cycle 0-7-6-2-0 has the chord (7, 2)
- Cycle 1-5-9-4-1 has the chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 1-5-0-7-1 has the chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 2-5-9-3-2 has the chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 3-2-6-8-3 has the chord (2, 6)
- Cycle 4-9-5-7-4 has the chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 6-7-0-5-6 has the chord (7, 5)
- Cycle 6-7-5-9-6 has the chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 6-8-9-5-6 has the chord (8, 5)
- Cycle 7-5-9-4-7 has the chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 8-9-5-1-8 has the chord (9, 1)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [15].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, (5, 4), 1, 0>
- <0, (5, 4), 9, 0>
- <0, (7, 1), 5, 0>
- <0, (7, 1), 4, 0>
- <0, (7, 2), 6, 0>
- <1, (5, 9), 4, 1>
- <1, (5, 7), 0, 1>
- <2, (5, 9), 3, 2>
- <3, (2, 6), 8, 3>
- <4, (9, 5), 7, 4>
- <6, (7, 5), 0, 6>
- <6, (7, 9), 5, 6>
- <6, (8, 5), 9, 6>
- <7, (5, 9), 4, 7>
- <8, (9, 1), 5, 8>
