Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
<0, 4, 3, 6> - Chord: (0, 3)
<0, 4, 1, 7> - Chord: (4, 7)
<1, 7, 0, 4> - Chord: (1, 4)
<2, 9, 11, 10> - Chord: (9, 10)
<3, 6, 4, 0> - Chord: (3, 4)
<4, 0, 7, 1> - Chord: (0, 1)
<4, 1, 7, 5> - Chord: (1, 7)
<5, 7, 1, 4> - Chord: (7, 4)
<9, 11, 1, 4> - Chord: (11, 1)
<10, 13, 5, 7> - Chord: (13, 5)
<11, 1, 7, 5> - Chord: (1, 5)
<12, 14, 13, 5> - Chord: (14, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
