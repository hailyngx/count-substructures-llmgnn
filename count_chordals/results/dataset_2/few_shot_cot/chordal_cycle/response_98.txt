Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <1, 12, 0, 3, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 12, 0, 13, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 12, 11, 6, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 5, 14, 6, 2>
- Cycle 5: <3, 9, 6, 14, 3>
- Cycle 6: <4, 9, 6, 14, 4>
- Cycle 7: <5, 9, 6, 14, 5>
- Cycle 8: <8, 9, 6, 14, 8>
- Cycle 9: <10, 5, 2, 13, 10>
- Cycle 10: <11, 6, 14, 13, 11>
- Cycle 11: <12, 10, 5, 2, 12>
- Cycle 12: <13, 0, 12, 11, 13>
- Cycle 13: <13, 1, 12, 0, 13>
- Cycle 14: <14, 5, 9, 6, 14>

Step 2: Check for chord in each cycle:
- In Cycle 1, the chord <1, 12> is present.
- In Cycle 2, the chord <0, 13> is present.
- In Cycle 3, the chord <1, 6> is present.
- In Cycle 4, the chord <5, 6> is present.
- In Cycle 5, the chord <9, 14> is present.
- In Cycle 6, the chord <9, 14> is present.
- In Cycle 7, the chord <9, 14> is present.
- In Cycle 8, the chord <9, 14> is present.
- In Cycle 9, the chord <5, 13> is present.
- In Cycle 10, the chord <6, 14> is present.
- In Cycle 11, the chord <10, 12> is present.
- In Cycle 12, the chord <0, 12> is present.
- In Cycle 13, the chord <1, 13> is present.
- In Cycle 14, the chord <5, 14> is present.

Step 3: Number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles present in the graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
