20. <6, 3, 8, 7> (chords: (6, 8))
21. <6, 7, 0, 2> (chords: (6, 0))
22. <7, 8, 4, 1> (chords: (7, 4))
23. <7, 8, 3, 1> (chords: (7, 3))
24. <7, 0, 2, 5> (chords: (7, 2))
25. <9, 2, 5, 1> (chords: (9, 5))
26. <9, 2, 6, 3> (chords: (9, 6))
27. <9, 0, 7, 1> (chords: (9, 7))

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 3, 5, 4> (chords: (1, 4))
- <1, 3, 8, 4> (chords: (1, 8))
- <1, 5, 4, 6> (chords: (1, 6))
- <1, 5, 2, 6> (chords: (1, 2))
- <1, 7, 6, 2> (chords: (1, 6))
- <1, 7, 0, 2> (chords: (1, 0))
- <1, 7, 8, 4> (chords: (1, 8))
- <3, 5, 4, 6> (chords: (3, 6))
- <3, 5, 2, 6> (chords: (3, 2))
- <3, 8, 4, 6> (chords: (3, 4))
- <3, 8, 7, 6> (chords: (3, 7))

Step 3:
There are 27 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [27].
