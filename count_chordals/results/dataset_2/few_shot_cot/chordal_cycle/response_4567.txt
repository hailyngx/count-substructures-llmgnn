Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- <5, 9, 1, 5>
- <5, 9, 7, 6, 5>
- <5, 9, 4, 1, 5>
- <5, 8, 1, 5>
- <5, 1, 4, 9, 5>
- <5, 1, 3, 5>
- <5, 1, 2, 6, 5>
- <9, 6, 0, 4, 9>
- <9, 4, 7, 6, 9>
- <9, 7, 2, 6, 9>
- <6, 7, 4, 9, 6>
- <1, 4, 9, 7, 1>
- <1, 8, 4, 9, 1>
- <1, 8, 5, 2, 1>
- <3, 1, 4, 9, 3>
- <7, 9, 6, 2, 7>
- <8, 5, 2, 7, 8>

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are: 
- <5, 9, 1, 5> (chord: (1, 9))
- <5, 9, 7, 6, 5> (chord: (7, 6))
- <5, 1, 4, 9, 5> (chord: (4, 9))
- <5, 1, 3, 5> (chord: (1, 3))
- <9, 6, 0, 4, 9> (chord: (0, 4))
- <1, 8, 5, 2, 1> (chord: (5, 2))

Step 3: 
The number of chordless cycles found is [11].
