59. <2, 17, 8, 1>
60. <2, 17, 8, 2>
...
(Note: Due to space, not all cycles are listed here.)

Step 2:
From the list of cycles above, we can see that the following cycles have exactly one chord:
1. <1, 9, 13, 9> (Chord: 13)
2. <1, 9, 17, 2> (Chord: 17)
3. <1, 16, 5, 12> (Chord: 5)
4. <1, 18, 1, 6> (Chord: 1)
5. <2, 17, 8, 9> (Chord: 8)
6. <2, 7, 3, 4> (Chord: 3)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
