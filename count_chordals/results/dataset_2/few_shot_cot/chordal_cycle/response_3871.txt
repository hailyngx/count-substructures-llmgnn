Response:
Step 1: We identify all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <4, 7, 5, 2, 4>
- Cycle 2: <4, 13, 4>
- Cycle 3: <4, 14, 17, 18, 7, 4>
- Cycle 4: <4, 16, 12, 3, 19, 16, 4>
- Cycle 5: <7, 15, 2, 17, 14, 4, 7>
- Cycle 6: <7, 18, 17, 14, 4, 13, 4, 7>
- Cycle 7: <7, 5, 1, 3, 12, 16, 4, 7>
- Cycle 8: <7, 5, 2, 9, 8, 3, 12, 6, 11, 10, 16, 4, 7>
- Cycle 9: <7, 5, 18, 17, 14, 4, 16, 12, 6, 11, 10, 16, 4, 13, 4, 7>
- Cycle 10: <7, 5, 18, 17, 14, 4, 16, 19, 3, 1, 5, 2, 9, 8, 3, 12, 6, 11, 10, 16, 4, 13, 4, 7>

Step 2: We check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 4) <4, (7, 5), 2, 4>
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (18, 17) <4, 7, 14, (17, 18), 4>
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (3, 16) <4, 16, (12, 3), 19, 16, 4>
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (15, 14) <4, 7, (17, 15), 2, 17, 14, 4>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (18, 17) <4, 7, 14, (17, 18), 13, 4, 7>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (2, 12) <4, 16, 12, (3, 2), 5, 7>
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (5, 11) <7, (5, 2), 12, 6, 11, 10, 16, 4>
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (5, 16) <7, (5, 18), 17, 14, 4, 16, (19, 3), 1, 5, 2, 9, 8, 3, 12, 6, 11, 10, 16, 13, 4, 7>
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (7, 5) <18, 17, 14, 4, (16, 19), 3, 1, 5, 2, 9, 8, 3, 12, 6, 11, 10, 16, 13, 4, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 2 chordless 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [2].

<4, 13, 4>
<7, 5, 1, 3, 12, 16, 4, 7>
