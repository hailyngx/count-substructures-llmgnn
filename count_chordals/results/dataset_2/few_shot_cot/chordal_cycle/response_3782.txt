Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 9) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 0) (9, 7) (9, 4) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: 
1. <1, 3, 2, 5>
2. <1, 4, 9, 0>
3. <1, 6, 5, 2>
4. <1, 8, 7, 0>
5. <3, 2, 5, 7>
6. <3, 1, 4, 9>
7. <5, 6, 1, 8>
8. <5, 2, 7, 0>
9. <6, 1, 8, 7>
10. <6, 5, 2, 3>
11. <7, 8, 1, 6>
12. <7, 0, 9, 4>
13. <8, 1, 4, 9>
14. <8, 5, 7, 0>
15. <0, 2, 7, 9>
16. <0, 9, 4, 1>

Step 2:
1. <1, 6, 5, 2> - Chord: (6, 5)
2. <1, 8, 7, 0> - Chord: (8, 7)
3. <3, 2, 5, 7> - Chord: (3, 5)
4. <3, 1, 4, 9> - Chord: (1, 9)
5. <5, 2, 7, 0> - Chord: (5, 7)
6. <6, 1, 8, 7> - Chord: (6, 8)
7. <7, 8, 1, 6> - Chord: (7, 1)
8. <8, 1, 4, 9> - Chord: (1, 4)
9. <8, 5, 7, 0> - Chord: (8, 5)
10. <0, 2, 7, 9> - Chord: (2, 7)

Step 3: 
Number of chordless 4-cycles: [6]
