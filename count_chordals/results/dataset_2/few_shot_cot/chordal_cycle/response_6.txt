Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1:  
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:  
<0, 6, 1, 2>, <0, 6, 1, 7>, <0, 6, 1, 8>, <0, 6, 4, 3>, <0, 8, 2, 1>, <0, 8, 2, 3>, <0, 8, 7, 9>, <0, 8, 7, 3>, <0, 7, 1, 6>, <0, 7, 1, 8>, <0, 7, 3, 4>, <1, 6, 4, 3>, <1, 6, 0, 8>, <1, 6, 0, 7>, <2, 8, 9, 3>, <3, 9, 8, 0>, <3, 9, 8, 7>, <4, 6, 0, 8>  

Step 2:  
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:  
<0, 6, 1, 7>  (chord: 1, 7)  
<0, 6, 4, 3>  (chord: 4, 3)  
<0, 8, 7, 3>  (chord: 7, 3)  
<0, 7, 1, 6>  (chord: 1, 6)  

Step 3:  
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [15].
