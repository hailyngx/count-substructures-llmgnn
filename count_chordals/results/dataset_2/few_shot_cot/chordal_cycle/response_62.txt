Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 13, 15, 10>
- Cycle 2: <0, 13, 7, 4>
- Cycle 3: <1, 11, 6, 7>
- Cycle 4: <1, 11, 10, 16>
- Cycle 5: <2, 4, 7, 6>
- Cycle 6: <2, 4, 16, 10>
- Cycle 7: <2, 19, 1, 18>
- Cycle 8: <2, 19, 8, 9>
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 6, 17>
- Cycle 10: <4, 7, 18, 14>
- Cycle 11: <4, 16, 5, 10>
- Cycle 12: <6, 7, 18, 0>
- Cycle 13: <6, 11, 10, 16>
- Cycle 14: <7, 13, 0, 18>
- Cycle 15: <13, 15, 10, 16>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has one chord <4, 10>.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has one chord <6, 16>.
- Cycle 5 has one chord <7, 17>.
- Cycle 6 has one chord <4, 10>.
- Cycle 7 has one chord <1, 18>.
- Cycle 8 has no chord.
- Cycle 9 has one chord <6, 17>.
- Cycle 10 has one chord <7, 14>.
- Cycle 11 has one chord <11, 16>.
- Cycle 12 has no chord.
- Cycle 13 has no chord.
- Cycle 14 has no chord.
- Cycle 15 has no chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 5 chordless cycles found: Cycle 1, Cycle 3, Cycle 8, Cycle 12, and Cycle 13.

Final answer: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 13, 15, 10>
<1, 11, 6, 7>
<2, 19, 8, 9>
<6, 7, 18, 0>
<13, 15, 10, 16>
