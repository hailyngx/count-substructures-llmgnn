Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph. We will list them first before checking for chords.

1. Cycle <3, 15, 14, 16>
2. Cycle <4, 7, 17, 10>
3. Cycle <4, 9, 19, 11>
4. Cycle <4, 13, 6, 1>
5. Cycle <6, 3, 12, 14>
6. Cycle <6, 5, 6, 13>
7. Cycle <1, 6, 18, 12>
8. Cycle <12, 3, 15, 14>
9. Cycle <12, 18, 11, 19>
10. Cycle <12, 16, 8, 11>

Step 2:
After checking each cycle above, we find that the following cycles have exactly one chord:
1. Cycle <4, 7, 17, 10> with chord (7, 17)
2. Cycle <4, 9, 19, 11> with chord (9, 19)
3. Cycle <1, 6, 18, 12> with chord (6, 18)
4. Cycle <12, 3, 15, 14> with chord (3, 15)

Step 3:
As per the above findings, there are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final answer is [4]. These cycles are:
1. <4, 7, 17, 10> with chord (7, 17)
2. <4, 9, 19, 11> with chord (9, 19)
3. <1, 6, 18, 12> with chord (6, 18)
4. <12, 3, 15, 14> with chord (3, 15)
