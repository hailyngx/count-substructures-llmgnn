Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<5, 6, 17, 4>
<16, 13, 10, 11>
<5, 2, 16, 11>
<8, 13, 10, 11>
<10, 14, 9, 18>
<5, 2, 8, 13>
<16, 11, 19, 18>
<14, 3, 4, 17>
<7, 13, 16, 11>
<15, 6, 17, 4>
<2, 8, 13, 10>
<14, 1, 3, 4>
<17, 6, 5, 2>
<19, 11, 16, 12>
<18, 5, 0, 6>
<9, 18, 19, 11>
<16, 2, 5, 18>
<12, 16, 11, 10>
<14, 10, 13, 8>
<3, 4, 17, 6>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <5, 6, 17, 4> has a chord (5, 17)
- <16, 13, 10, 11> has a chord (13, 10)
- <10, 14, 9, 18> has a chord (14, 9)
- <14, 1, 3, 4> has a chord (1, 3)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 6, 17, 4>
<16, 13, 10, 11>
<10, 14, 9, 18>
<14, 1, 3, 4>
