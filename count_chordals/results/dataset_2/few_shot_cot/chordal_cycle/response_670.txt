Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 4, 9, 7>
- <0, 4, 1, 8>
- <0, 7, 9, 11>
- <0, 1, 13, 6>
- <1, 4, 9, 7>
- <1, 4, 0, 8>
- <1, 8, 10, 2>
- <1, 13, 12, 11>
- <2, 10, 8, 12>
- <2, 12, 13, 6>
- <2, 12, 11, 3>
- <2, 7, 9, 11>
- <5, 7, 9, 11>
- <5, 10, 8, 12>
- <5, 14, 10, 8>
- <6, 3, 11, 9>
- <6, 9, 11, 10>
- <6, 13, 12, 11>
- <6, 13, 7, 9>
- <7, 9, 11, 10>
- <7, 9, 4, 0>
- <7, 13, 12, 2>
- <10, 11, 6, 3>
- <10, 11, 12, 2>
- <10, 14, 5, 7>
- <11, 9, 4, 0>
- <12, 11, 3, 6>
- <13, 12, 2, 14>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 4, 9, 7> has the chord <4, 7>
- <0, 7, 9, 11> has the chord <7, 11>
- <0, 1, 13, 6> has the chord <1, 6>
- <1, 13, 12, 11> has the chord <13, 11>
- <2, 10, 8, 12> has the chord <10, 8>
- <2, 12, 13, 6> has the chord <12, 6>
- <2, 7, 9, 11> has the chord <7, 11>
- <5, 7, 9, 11> has the chord <7, 9>
- <6, 3, 11, 9> has the chord <3, 9>
- <10, 11, 6, 3> has the chord <11, 3>
- <13, 12, 2, 14> has the chord <12, 14>

Step 3:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [11].
