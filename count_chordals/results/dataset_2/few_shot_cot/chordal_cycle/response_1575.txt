Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 2, 7, 3>
- <0, 2, 8, 10, 4>
- <0, 2, 8, 7, 5>
- <1, 5, 7, 3>
- <1, 5, 7, 14, 6>
- <1, 5, 9, 12>
- <1, 12, 8, 2>
- <1, 12, 11, 5>
- <2, 6, 14, 7>
- <2, 8, 0, 13>
- <3, 7, 5, 1>
- <3, 7, 14, 6>
- <3, 4, 1, 12>
- <4, 10, 8, 7>
- <4, 1, 5, 7>
- <4, 3, 7, 14>

Step 2: 
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5, 12), 9, 11>
- <1, (5, 7), 3, 14>
- <1, (1, 12), 8, 11>
- <2, (14, 6), 7, 5>
- <2, (0, 13), 8, 7>
- <3, (1, 12), 7, 5>
- <4, (1, 5), 7, 3>

Step 3: 
The number of chordless cycles found is [9].
