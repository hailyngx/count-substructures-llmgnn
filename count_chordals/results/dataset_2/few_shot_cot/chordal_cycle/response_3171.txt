- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (2, 15)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (2, 5)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (2, 18)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (1, 17)
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (3, 15)
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: (5, 18)
- Cycle 12 has 1 chord: (12, 16)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
