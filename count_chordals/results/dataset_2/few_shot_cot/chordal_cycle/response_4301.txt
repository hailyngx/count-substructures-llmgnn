Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 10, 7, 1>
- <0, 10, 11, 13>
- <0, 5, 3, 13>
- <0, 2, 14, 4>
- <0, 6, 5, 3>
- <7, 1, 4, 14>
- <7, 10, 0, 6>
- <7, 9, 14, 2>
- <7, 0, 10, 12>
- <1, 8, 13, 12>
- <1, 4, 14, 9>
- <1, 7, 0, 2>
- <1, 9, 3, 13>
- <2, 14, 9, 1>
- <2, 3, 9, 1>
- <3, 13, 12, 11>
- <3, 5, 0, 10>
- <3, 9, 1, 4>
- <4, 14, 2, 0>
- <4, 1, 9, 3>
- <5, 0, 2, 14>
- <5, 3, 9, 1>
- <6, 0, 10, 7>
- <9, 1, 7, 10>
- <9, 14, 2, 0>
- <10, 0, 2, 14>
- <10, 7, 1, 4>
- <11, 13, 8, 1>
- <11, 12, 13, 8>
- <12, 13, 8, 1>
- <13, 12, 11, 10>
- <14, 2, 0, 6>
- <14, 4, 1, 7>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 10, 7, 1> (Chord: (10, 7))
- <0, 5, 3, 13> (Chord: (5, 13))
- <7, 1, 4, 14> (Chord: (1, 14))
- <7, 0, 10, 12> (Chord: (0, 12))
- <1, 8, 13, 12> (Chord: (8, 12))
- <1, 9, 3, 13> (Chord: (9, 3))
- <2, 14, 9, 1> (Chord: (14, 9))
- <3, 13, 12, 11> (Chord: (13, 12))
- <4, 14, 2, 0> (Chord: (14, 2))

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final answer is [9].
