- Cycle 9: <0, 10, 12, 7>
- Cycle 10: <0, 10, 12, 7, 6>
- Cycle 11: <0, 11, 12, 7>
- Cycle 12: <2, 8, 1, 9>

- Cycle 49: <19, 15, 13, 17, 12>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
The cycle <0, 4, 10, 12> has exactly one chord (0, 12).
The cycle <0, 6, 7, 12> has exactly one chord (6, 12).
The cycle <2, 8, 1, 9> has exactly one chord (8, 9).
The cycle <2, 15, 13, 9> has exactly one chord (15, 13).
The cycle <5, 9, 1, 8> has exactly one chord (9, 1).
The cycle <7, 12, 17, 13> has exactly one chord (12, 13).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
