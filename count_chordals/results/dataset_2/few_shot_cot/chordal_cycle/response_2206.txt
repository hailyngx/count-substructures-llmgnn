Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 25, 27, 5, 8, 20, 14) 
- Cycle 2: (0, 25, 19, 29, 24, 4, 12) 
- Cycle 3: (0, 25, 19, 29, 10, 17, 12) 
- Cycle 4: (1, 21, 2, 9, 8, 20, 14) 
- Cycle 5: (1, 21, 15, 22, 11, 20, 14) 
- Cycle 6: (1, 28, 16, 6, 3, 17, 12) 
- Cycle 7: (2, 21, 15, 22, 11, 20, 14) 
- Cycle 8: (2, 21, 15, 10, 17, 12, 4) 
- Cycle 9: (3, 17, 10, 29, 24, 18, 0)

- Cycle 21: (6, 3, 17, 12, 4, 23, 23) 

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (2, 4), 5, 8>
- <4, (10, 12), 2, 9>
- <10, (3, 17), 29, 24>
- <15, (11, 21), 22, 1>
- <3, (6, 17), 12, 4>
- <6, (3, 16), 23, 21>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0].
