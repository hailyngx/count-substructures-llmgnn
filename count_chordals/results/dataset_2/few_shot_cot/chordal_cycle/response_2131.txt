Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 9, 13, 6>
- Cycle <0, 3, 10, 12>
- Cycle <0, 3, 12, 7>
- Cycle <0, 1, 7, 12>
- Cycle <1, 7, 12, 11>
- Cycle <1, 11, 6, 13>
- Cycle <2, 4, 8, 9>
- Cycle <3, 10, 14, 11>
- Cycle <3, 12, 11, 4>
- Cycle <4, 11, 12, 3>
- Cycle <6, 1, 7, 12>
- Cycle <6, 7, 13, 14>
- Cycle <6, 11, 14, 10>
- Cycle <7, 12, 10, 8>
- Cycle <9, 8, 4, 2>
- Cycle <9, 13, 14, 11>
- Cycle <10, 8, 4, 11>
- Cycle <10, 12, 7, 6>
- Cycle <11, 14, 13, 6>
- Cycle <12, 11, 5, 3>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycle <0, 9, 13, 6> with chord (9, 13)
- Chordal cycle <0, 3, 10, 12> with chord (3, 10)
- Chordal cycle <0, 3, 12, 7> with chord (3, 12)
- Chordal cycle <0, 1, 7, 12> with chord (1, 7)
- Chordal cycle <1, 7, 12, 11> with chord (7, 11)
- Chordal cycle <1, 11, 6, 13> with chord (11, 6)
- Chordal cycle <2, 4, 8, 9> with chord (4, 8)
- Chordal cycle <6, 1, 7, 12> with chord (1, 7)
- Chordal cycle <6, 7, 13, 14> with chord (7, 13)
- Chordal cycle <6, 11, 14, 10> with chord (11, 10)
- Chordal cycle <7, 12, 10, 8> with chord (12, 10)
- Chordal cycle <9, 8, 4, 2> with chord (8, 4)
- Chordal cycle <10, 8, 4, 11> with chord (8, 4)
- Chordal cycle <10, 12, 7, 6> with chord (12, 7)
- Chordal cycle <11, 14, 13, 6> with chord (14, 13)
- Chordal cycle <12, 11, 5, 3> with chord (11, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are a total of 16 chordal 4-cycles, so the final result is [16].
