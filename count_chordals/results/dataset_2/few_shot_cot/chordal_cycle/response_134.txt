Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <5, 9, 4, 6, 10>
- <15, 3, 0, 13, 4>
- <15, 3, 0, 13, 2>
- <15, 3, 0, 13, 1>
- <15, 18, 16, 14, 7>
- <15, 18, 16, 14, 17>
- <15, 18, 16, 12, 19>
- <5, 18, 16, 14, 7>
- <5, 18, 16, 14, 17>
- <5, 18, 16, 12, 19>
- <5, 9, 4, 13, 0>
- <5, 9, 4, 13, 2>
- <5, 9, 4, 13, 1>
- <10, 6, 4, 13, 0>
- <10, 6, 4, 13, 2>
- <10, 6, 4, 13, 1>

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord (edge connecting non-adjacent nodes) are:
- <5, 9, 4, (13), 0>
- <5, 9, 4, (13), 2>
- <5, 9, 4, (13), 1>
- <10, 6, 4, (13), 0>
- <10, 6, 4, (13), 2>
- <10, 6, 4, (13), 1>

Step 3: 
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
