Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <0, 1, 4, 6, 5, 3, 0>
        - Cycle 2: <7, 6, 5, 7>
        - Cycle 3: <9, 7, 0, 9>
        - Cycle 4: <8, 7, 6, 8>
        - Cycle 5: <3, 4, 6, 3>
        - Cycle 6: <0, 3, 8, 0>
        - Cycle 7: <0, 7, 9, 0>
        - Cycle 8: <3, 5, 6, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Only Cycle 1: <0, 1, 4, 6, 5, 3, 0> has one chord: (0, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There are 7 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [7].
