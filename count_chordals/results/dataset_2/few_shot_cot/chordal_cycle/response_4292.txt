Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 10, 1, 4, 17, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 16, 8, 18, 19, 16, 11)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 2, 13, 6, 12, 11, 16, 10, 11, 14, 0, 17, 4, 1, 10, 16, 8, 18, 19, 13, 6, 12, 3, 13, 9, 5)
- Cycle 4: (7, 5, 9, 2, 13, 19, 16, 8, 18, 19, 13, 3, 4, 17, 11, 12, 6, 13, 9, 17, 0, 7)
- Cycle 5: (0, 7, 15, 7)

Step 2: Checking for a single chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord
- Cycle 2 has no chord
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <11, (10, 1)>
- Cycle 4 has a chord: <19, (13, 3)>
- Cycle 5 has no chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 2 chordless cycles found, thus the final answer is [2].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<11, 16, 10, 1, 4, 17, 11>
<11, 16, 8, 18, 19, 16, 11>
