Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- For cycle 1, <0, 3, 25, 0>, found chord: (3, 25)
- For cycle 2, <0, 4, 29, 23, 1>, found chord: (4, 23)
- For cycle 7, <1, 12, 9, 6, 15>, found chord: (9, 15)
- For cycle 8, <1, 12, 27, 18, 4>, found chord: (12, 18)
- For cycle 10, <2, 11, 7, 14, 21>, found chord: (7, 14)
- For cycle 12, <3, 26, 19, 23, 29>, found chord: (26, 19)
- For cycle 13, <3, 26, 15, 23, 29>, found chord: (3, 15)
- For cycle 15, <3, 0, 25, 20, 11>, found chord: (0, 25)
- For cycle 20, <6, 9, 12, 1, 16>, found chord: (9, 1)
- For cycle 22, <6, 15, 23, 29, 4>, found chord: (15, 29)
- For cycle 24, <7, 8, 4, 18, 27>, found chord: (8, 4)
- For cycle 26, <8, 4, 29, 23, 15>, found chord: (4, 29)
- For cycle 30, <12, 9, 6, 24, 18>, found chord: (9, 24)
- For cycle 33, <21, 22, 10, 22, 21>, found chord: (22, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 19.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [19].
