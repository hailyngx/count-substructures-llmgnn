Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (0, 11, 12, 18, 7, 2) 
- Cycle 2: (0, 11, 14, 16, 13)
- Cycle 3: (2, 1, 6, 15, 17)
- Cycle 4: (4, 3, 8, 5, 4)
- Cycle 5: (11, 10, 12, 18, 7)
- Cycle 6: (11, 10, 12, 18, 9)
- Cycle 7: (11, 14, 16, 13, 6)
- Cycle 8: (17, 15, 6, 1, 2)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 11, 12, 18, 7> - No chord
- <0, 11, 14, 16, 13> - Chord: (2, 7)
- <2, 1, 6, 15, 17> - No chord
- <4, 3, 8, 5, 4> - No chord
- <11, 10, 12, 18, 7> - No chord
- <11, 10, 12, 18, 9> - Chord: (9, 18)
- <11, 14, 16, 13, 6> - No chord
- <17, 15, 6, 1, 2> - No chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [5]

Thus, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 11, 12, 18, 7> with 5 chordless cycles.
