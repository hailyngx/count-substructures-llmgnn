Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-6-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-9-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-7-4-0
- Cycle 4: 0-4-2-3-0
- Cycle 5: 1-9-2-4-1
- Cycle 6: 1-8-7-4-1
- Cycle 7: 2-9-7-8-2
- Cycle 8: 3-5-0-7-3
- Cycle 9: 3-4-2-8-3
- Cycle 10: 4-0-7-8-4
- Cycle 11: 5-6-9-1-5
- Cycle 12: 6-9-7-8-6

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, (5, 1), 6>
- <0, (1, 9), 7>
- <0, (3, 7), 4>
- <1, (9, 2), 4>
- <1, (8, 7), 4>
- <2, (9, 7), 8>
- <3, (5, 7), 0>
- <3, (4, 8), 2>
- <4, (0, 7), 8>
- <5, (6, 9), 1>
- <6, (9, 7), 8>

Step 3:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [11].
