Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 14), 4, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (3, 10), 2, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, (3, 14), 4, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, (8, 5), 3, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, (10, 13), 7, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <3, (1, 4), 12, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, (2, 8), 5, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <3, (10, 13), 7, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <4, (1, 3), 14, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <5, (3, 6), 9, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <5, (7, 13), 8, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <6, (5, 9), 8, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <7, (0, 1), 13, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <10, (3, 13), 7, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <14, (4, 12), 10, 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 24 chordless 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [24].
