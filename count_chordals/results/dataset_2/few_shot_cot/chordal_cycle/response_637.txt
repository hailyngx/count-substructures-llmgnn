Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 9, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <4, 7, 6, 1>
2. <4, 7, 8, 9>
3. <4, 5, 3, 0>
4. <1, 6, 9, 3>
5. <1, 6, 7, 4>
6. <1, 3, 9, 8>
7. <1, 3, 5, 2>
8. <1, 3, 4, 7>
9. <1, 4, 5, 3>
10. <1, 4, 7, 8>
11. <1, 8, 7, 4>
12. <2, 5, 3, 1>
13. <2, 5, 8, 7>
14. <3, 4, 7, 8>
15. <3, 5, 4, 7>
16. <3, 5, 2, 1>
17. <4, 7, 8, 1>
18. <5, 8, 7, 4>
19. <5, 4, 3, 0>
20. <6, 7, 8, 9>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord) are:
1. <1, 4, 7, 8, 1>
2. <1, 3, 9, 8, 1>
3. <1, 3, 5, 4, 7>
4. <2, 5, 3, 1, 2>
5. <3, 4, 7, 8, 3>
6. <3, 5, 4, 7, 3>
7. <4, 7, 6, 1, 4>
8. <5, 8, 7, 4, 5>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [12].
