Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is <1, 10, (6, 19), 13>.

Following the steps provided earlier, the process of finding the chordal 4-cycle is as follows:

Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- (1, 17, 14, 11, 6, 1)
- (1, 17, 14, 11, 16, 0, 12, 1)
- (1, 17, 14, 5, 0, 16, 11, 6, 1)
- (1, 17, 8, 12, 0, 16, 11, 6, 1)
- (1, 10, 5, 14, 17, 1)
- (1, 10, 2, 8, 17, 1)
- (1, 6, 11, 16, 3, 19, 15, 7, 18, 2, 10, 1)
- (6, 11, 16, 3, 19, 15, 7, 18, 2, 10, 1, 6)
- (6, 19, 3, 16, 11, 14, 5, 10, 2, 18, 7, 15, 19, 6)
- (13, 3, 16, 11, 14, 5, 10, 2, 8, 17, 1, 12, 0, 5, 14, 13)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- The cycle (6, 19, 3, 16, 11, 14, 5, 10, 2, 18, 7, 15, 19, 6) has exactly one chord (6, 19), forming the chordal 4-cycle <1, 10, (6, 19), 13>.

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles found. As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, the count is [1].
