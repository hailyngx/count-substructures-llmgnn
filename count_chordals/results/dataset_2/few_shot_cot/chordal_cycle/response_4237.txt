Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- 1-14-6-2-1
- 3-10-1-14-3
- 4-13-10-1-4
- 5-12-4-13-5
- 6-13-4-12-6
- 7-11-10-13-7
- 8-11-7-14-8
- 9-10-1-12-9

Step 2: Checking each cycle for a chord:
- <1, 14, 6, 2> has a chord (1,2)
- <3, 10, 1, 14> has a chord (3,14)
- <4, 13, 10, 1> has a chord (4,1)
- <5, 12, 4, 13> has a chord (5,4)
- <6, 13, 4, 12> has a chord (6,4)
- <7, 11, 10, 13> has a chord (7,10)
- <8, 11, 7, 14> has a chord (8,14)
- <9, 10, 1, 12> has a chord (9,1)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
- There are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count is [0].
