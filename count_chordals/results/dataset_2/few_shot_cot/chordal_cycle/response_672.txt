Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 4, 6, 3, 0> (Chord: (4, 3))
2. <0, 4, 7, 2, 0> (Chord: (4, 2))
3. <0, 8, 9, 7, 0> (Chord: (8, 7))
4. <0, 1, 2, 7, 0> (Chord: (1, 7))
5. <2, 7, 4, 6, 2> (Chord: (7, 6))
6. <4, 5, 3, 6, 4> (Chord: (5, 3))
7. <7, 9, 8, 4, 7> (Chord: (9, 8))

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
<0, 4, 6, 3, 0> (Chord: (4, 3))
<0, 4, 7, 2, 0> (Chord: (4, 2))
<0, 8, 9, 7, 0> (Chord: (8, 7))
<0, 1, 2, 7, 0> (Chord: (1, 7))
<2, 7, 4, 6, 2> (Chord: (7, 6))
<4, 5, 3, 6, 4> (Chord: (5, 3))
<7, 9, 8, 4, 7> (Chord: (9, 8))

Step 3:
There are a total of 7 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [7].
