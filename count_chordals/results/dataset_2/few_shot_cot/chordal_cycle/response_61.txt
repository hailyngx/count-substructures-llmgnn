Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- 4-cycle: <0, 14, 4, 5>
- 4-cycle: <0, 1, 2, 4>
- 4-cycle: <0, 10, 4, 5>
- 4-cycle: <0, 13, 5, 4>
- 4-cycle: <9, 8, 6, 13>
- 4-cycle: <9, 13, 5, 4>
- 4-cycle: <9, 13, 7, 11>
- 4-cycle: <1, 2, 5, 13>
- 4-cycle: <10, 4, 2, 5>
- 4-cycle: <10, 12, 5, 13>
- 4-cycle: <10, 2, 3, 12>
- 4-cycle: <11, 6, 13, 9>
- 4-cycle: <11, 7, 14, 0>
- 4-cycle: <11, 13, 6, 8>
- 4-cycle: <11, 13, 9, 3>
- 4-cycle: <12, 5, 13, 9>
- 4-cycle: <12, 10, 4, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (1, 14), 2, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (13, 5), 4, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (8, 6), 13, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (13, 7), 11, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (2, 5), 13, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <10, (4, 2), 5, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <10, (12, 5), 13, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <11, (7, 14), 0, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <11, (13, 6), 8, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <12, (10, 4), 5, 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are a total of 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the final number is [10].
