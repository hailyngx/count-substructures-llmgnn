Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the graph.

Step 2:
- There are two chordal 4-cycles in the graph:
    <0, 9, 4, 1> with chord (4, 8)
    <1, 4, 8, 9> with chord (8, 9)

Step 3:
- As there are two chordal 4-cycles, the number of chordless cycles found is [0].
