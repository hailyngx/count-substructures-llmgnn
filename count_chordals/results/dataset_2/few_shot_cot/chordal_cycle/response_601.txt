Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 4, 9, 8, 5, 0>
- Cycle <1, 2, 8, 5, 7, 1>
- Cycle <1, 3, 9, 4, 8, 2, 1>
- Cycle <2, 7, 0, 5, 8, 2>
- Cycle <3, 9, 8, 4, 0, 7, 3>
- Cycle <4, 6, 5, 8, 9, 4>
- Cycle <5, 6, 7, 0, 2, 8, 5>
- Cycle <6, 1, 2, 8, 5, 7, 6>
- Cycle <7, 0, 4, 9, 3, 7>
- Cycle <9, 3, 1, 2, 8, 4, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycle found: <1, 3, 9, 4, 8, 2, 1> with chord (3, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- We found 1 chordal 4-cycle, so the final answer is [1].
