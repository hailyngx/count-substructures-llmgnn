45. <24, 5, 24, 9>
46. <25, 10, 17, 7>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- From the above list, the following cycles have exactly one chord:
1. <3, 24, 9, (6), 21>
2. <1, 17, 7, (8), 15>
3. <10, 17, 1, (18), 26>
4. <17, 1, 13, (27), 20>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 42 cycles in total, and 4 of them have exactly one chord.
- Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [38].
