Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:

There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph, including:
- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 11, 3, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 12, 10, 17, 6, 5>
- Cycle 3: <6, 9, 4, 13, 2, 11, 6>
- Cycle 4: <6, 9, 4, 14, 11, 17, 6>
- Cycle 5: <6, 9, 7, 15, 1, 5, 6>
- Cycle 6: <6, 17, 10, 12, 18, 0, 6>
- Cycle 7: <8, 13, 4, 9, 6, 17, 8>
- Cycle 8: <11, 17, 8, 13, 4, 14, 11>
- Cycle 9: <12, 5, 1, 15, 13, 4, 12>
- Cycle 10: <17, 6, 9, 4, 14, 11, 17>
- Cycle 11: <17, 8, 13, 2, 11, 14, 17>
- Cycle 12: <17, 10, 12, 5, 3, 11, 17>
- Cycle 13: <18, 12, 5, 1, 15, 7, 18>
- Cycle 14: <19, 6, 9, 4, 13, 15, 19>

Step 2: Checking for chordal 4-cycles:

Out of these cycles, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 12, 10, 17, 6, 5> (Chord: (12, 17))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:

There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the count of chordless cycles is [14].
