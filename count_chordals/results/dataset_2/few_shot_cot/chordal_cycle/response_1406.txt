Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle <2, 9, 4, 3>
2. Cycle <3, 17, 14, 15>
3. Cycle <3, 17, 16, 23>
4. Cycle <3, 7, 20, 0>
5. Cycle <3, 25, 12, 2>
6. Cycle <4, 26, 18, 5>
7. Cycle <4, 9, 2, 12>
8. Cycle <4, 9, 29, 20>
9. Cycle <4, 13, 6, 21>
10. Cycle <5, 26, 18, 4>

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Cycle <2, 9, 4, 3> has one chord: (4, 9)
2. Cycle <3, 17, 14, 15> has one chord: (14, 17)
3. Cycle <3, 17, 16, 23> has one chord: (16, 17)
4. Cycle <3, 7, 20, 0> has one chord: (0, 20)
5. Cycle <3, 25, 12, 2> has one chord: (12, 25)
6. Cycle <4, 26, 18, 5> has one chord: (18, 26)
7. Cycle <4, 9, 2, 12> has one chord: (2, 9)
8. Cycle <4, 9, 29, 20> has one chord: (20, 29)
9. Cycle <4, 13, 6, 21> has one chord: (6, 13)
10. Cycle <5, 26, 18, 4> has one chord: (18, 26)

Therefore, there are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final answer is [10].
