Step 2: Chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 10, 6, 5> (Chord: (0, 10))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 14, 5, 7> (Chord: (5, 14))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 15, 18, 4> (Chord: (15, 18))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, 8, 11, 9> (Chord: (8, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <13, 16, 8, 11> (Chord: (13, 16))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 32 cycles and 5 of them are chordal 4-cycles. So, the number of chordless 4-cycles is: [27].
