Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle 2: <9, 1, 7, 4, 9>
- Cycle 3: <4, 7, 0, 3, 4>
- Cycle 4: <7, 1, 9, 5, 7>
- Cycle 5: <1, 8, 4, 3, 1>
- Cycle 6: <3, 0, 7, 5, 3>
- Cycle 7: <6, 8, 4, 3, 6>
- Cycle 8: <8, 2, 0, 5, 8>
- Cycle 9: <2, 9, 5, 7, 2>

Step 2:  
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (7, 0)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (3, 6)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (0, 5)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (9, 5)

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, [9].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<5, 9, 6, 5>
<9, 1, 7, 4, 9>
<4, 7, 0, 3, 4>
<7, 1, 9, 5, 7>
<1, 8, 4, 3, 1>
<3, 0, 7, 5, 3>
<6, 8, 4, 3, 6>
<8, 2, 0, 5, 8>
<2, 9, 5, 7, 2>
