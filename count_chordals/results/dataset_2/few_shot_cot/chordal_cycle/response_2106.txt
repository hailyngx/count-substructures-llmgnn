Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in this graph is: <3, (11, 14), 1>

Following the steps provided:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <3, (11, 14), 1>, which has a chord between nodes 11 and 14.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Since there are no chordless cycles found, the final count is [0].
