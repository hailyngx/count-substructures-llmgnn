Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 5, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (0, 6, 3, 1, 4)
- (0, 6, 3, 5, 4)
- (0, 6, 3, 5, 2)
- (0, 6, 3, 7, 5)
- (0, 3, 1, 4, 8)
- (0, 3, 5, 4, 8)
- (0, 3, 5, 2, 4)
- (0, 3, 7, 5, 6)
- (1, 3, 5, 4, 2)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 6, 3, 1, 4> has a chord (1, 4)
- <0, 6, 3, 5, 4> has a chord (5, 4)
- <0, 3, 1, 4, 8> has a chord (1, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <0, 3, 5, 4, 2>
