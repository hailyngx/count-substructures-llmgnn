Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is:
<1, (13, 14), 9, 15)> 

Here is the explanation of how the unique chordal 4-cycle was found:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
-  Cycle: 1-13-14-9-1
-  Cycle: 1-13-14-9-15-1

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- The cycle 1-13-14-9-1 does not have a chord.
- The cycle 1-13-14-9-15-1 has exactly one chord 9-15.

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <1, (13, 14), 9, 15)>.
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
