Step 2: Check for chords in the cycles:
- Chordal cycle 1: <0, 12, 5, 8> (Chord: (12, 8))
- Chordal cycle 2: <1, 3, 11, 7> (Chord: (3, 7))
- Chordal cycle 3: <1, 3, 10, 4> (Chord: (3, 10))
- Chordal cycle 4: <2, 5, 8, 7> (Chord: (5, 7))
- Chordal cycle 5: <3, 1, 8, 5> (Chord: (1, 5))
- Chordal cycle 6: <3, 11, 7, 16> (Chord: (11, 16))
- Chordal cycle 7: <4, 10, 12, 5> (Chord: (10, 12))
- Chordal cycle 8: <5, 8, 13, 5> (Chord: (8, 13))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found = 8
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
