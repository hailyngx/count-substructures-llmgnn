Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 5, 4, 9> with the edges (0, 6), (6, 5), (5, 4), and (4, 9)
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 3, 5, 4> with the edges (0, 6), (6, 3), (3, 5), and (5, 4)
- Cycle 3: <0, 2, 9, 5, 4> with the edges (0, 2), (2, 9), (9, 5), and (5, 4)
- Cycle 4: <0, 2, 4, 9, 8> with the edges (0, 2), (2, 4), (4, 9), and (9, 8)
- Cycle 5: <0, 7, 8, 9, 4> with the edges (0, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), and (9, 4)
- Cycle 6: <0, 7, 3, 5, 4> with the edges (0, 7), (7, 3), (3, 5), and (5, 4)
- Cycle 7: <0, 1, 6, 5, 4> with the edges (0, 1), (1, 6), (6, 5), and (5, 4)
- Cycle 8: <1, 6, 5, 4, 9> with the edges (1, 6), (6, 5), (5, 4), and (4, 9)
- Cycle 9: <2, 9, 8, 7, 0> with the edges (2, 9), (9, 8), (8, 7), and (7, 0)
- Cycle 10: <2, 9, 8, 3, 6> with the edges (2, 9), (9, 8), (8, 3), and (3, 6)
- Cycle 11: <2, 4, 8, 3, 6> with the edges (2, 4), (4, 8), (8, 3), and (3, 6)
- Cycle 12: <2, 4, 5, 9, 8> with the edges (2, 4), (4, 5), (5, 9), and (9, 8)
- Cycle 13: <3, 6, 5, 4, 9> with the edges (3, 6), (6, 5), (5, 4), and (4, 9)
- Cycle 14: <3, 6, 0, 7, 8> with the edges (3, 6), (6, 0), (0, 7), and (7, 8)
- Cycle 15: <3, 7, 8, 9, 4> with the edges (3, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), and (9, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle <2, 4, 5, 9, 8> has a chord (4, 9)
- The cycle <3, 6, 5, 4, 9> has a chord (6, 4)
- The cycle <3, 7, 8, 9, 4> has a chord (7, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
