Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle <0, 5, 9, 2>
- Cycle <0, 5, 13, 7>
- Cycle <0, 5, 14, 4>
- Cycle <1, 4, 3, 9>
- Cycle <1, 4, 8, 7>
- Cycle <1, 4, 14, 10>
- Cycle <1, 8, 12, 2>
- Cycle <1, 8, 4, 3>
- Cycle <1, 10, 6, 7>
- Cycle <1, 10, 12, 8>
- Cycle <1, 10, 14, 4>
- Cycle <2, 7, 13, 5>
- Cycle <2, 7, 13, 11>
- Cycle <2, 7, 13, 11>
- Cycle <3, 4, 8, 12>
- Cycle <3, 9, 5, 13>
- Cycle <3, 9, 11, 13>
- Cycle <4, 8, 12, 10>
- Cycle <4, 14, 10, 6>
- Cycle <5, 13, 7, 6>
- Cycle <5, 14, 10, 6>
- Cycle <6, 7, 8, 4>
- Cycle <8, 12, 9, 5>
- Cycle <9, 11, 3, 4>
- Cycle <9, 11, 13, 5>
- Cycle <10, 12, 8, 4>
- Cycle <10, 14, 4, 1>
- Cycle <11, 13, 7, 6>
- Cycle <12, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle <14, 10, 6, 7>

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles are: 
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 5, 13, 7>, with chord (13, 7)

Step 3: 
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
