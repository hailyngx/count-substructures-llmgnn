- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 19, 28>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 19, 29>
- Cycle 5: <5, 26, 23, 6>

- Cycle 28: <25, 22, 14, 2>
- Cycle 29: <25, 22, 0, 10>
- Cycle 30: <8, 15, 17, 1>
- Cycle 31: <8, 15, 14, 25>

- Cycle 36: <26, 7, 18, 11>
- Cycle 37: <26, 23, 1, 10>
- Cycle 38: <4, 11, 18, 27>
- Cycle 39: <4, 12, 23, 6>
  
Step 2:
Only Cycle 2: <5, 9, 16, 28> has exactly one chord: (9, 28).

Hence, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
