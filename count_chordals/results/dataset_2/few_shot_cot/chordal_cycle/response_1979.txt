Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- <0, 2, 5, 1>
- <0, 2, 15, 11>
- <0, 16, 19, 3>
- <0, 17, 11, 13>
- <1, 5, 4, 9>
- <1, 8, 6, 9>
- <2, 5, 4, 9>
- <2, 15, 11, 3>
- <2, 14, 12, 19>
- <3, 11, 13, 7>
- <4, 9, 6, 7>
- <4, 5, 1, 8>
- <4, 18, 10, 7>
- <5, 2, 15, 11>
- <5, 1, 8, 6>
- <6, 9, 4, 5>
- <6, 7, 5, 2>
- <6, 8, 1, 5>
- <7, 13, 11, 15>
- <7, 6, 9, 4>
- <7, 10, 18, 8>

- <8, 6, 9, 4>
- <8, 18, 10, 7>
- <9, 4, 5, 2>
- <9, 6, 7, 13>
- <9, 10, 18, 4>
- <10, 7, 6, 9>
- <10, 18, 4, 5>

- <12, 19, 3, 11>
- <13, 4, 5, 1>
- <13, 11, 17, 0>
- <13, 7, 6, 9>
- <14, 2, 5, 1>

- <19, 9, 6, 7>
- <19, 16, 0, 17>
- <19, 12, 2, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

The chordal 4-cycles with a single chord are:
- <0, 2, 5, 1> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <0, 2, 15, 11> (Chord: (15, 11))
- <0, 16, 19, 3> (Chord: (16, 19))
- <0, 17, 11, 13> (Chord: (17, 11))
- <17, 0, 16, 19> (Chord: (0, 16))
- <1, 5, 4, 9> (Chord: (5, 4))
- <1, 8, 6, 9> (Chord: (8, 6))
- <2, 5, 4, 9> (Chord: (5, 4))
- <2, 15, 11, 3> (Chord: (15, 11))
- <2, 14, 12, 19> (Chord: (14, 19))
- <3, 11, 13, 7> (Chord: (11, 13))
- <4, 18, 10, 7> (Chord: (18, 10))
- <7, 10, 18, 8> (Chord: (18, 8))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
