Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
<0, 12, 1, 18, 8>
<0, 12, 1, 13, 10>
<0, 12, 1, 13, 14>
<0, 12, 1, 18, 15>
<0, 12, 8, 18, 15>
<1, 2, 9, 5, 7>
<1, 2, 17, 16, 3>
<1, 2, 17, 4, 14>
<1, 13, 10, 3, 16>
<1, 13, 14, 4, 17>
<1, 18, 8, 0, 12>
<1, 18, 15, 14, 4>
<2, 9, 11, 12, 1>
<2, 9, 19, 10, 3>
<3, 10, 7, 5, 9>
