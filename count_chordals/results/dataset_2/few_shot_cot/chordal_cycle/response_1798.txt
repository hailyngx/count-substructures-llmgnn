Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 17, 4>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 17, 6>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 16, 7>
- Cycle 4: <5, 12, 7, 4>
- Cycle 5: <9, 15, 16, 13>
- Cycle 6: <9, 15, 18, 11>
- Cycle 7: <9, 17, 4, 2>
- Cycle 8: <4, 7, 12, 5>
- Cycle 9: <4, 17, 6, 3>
- Cycle 10: <7, 12, 0, 11>
- Cycle 11: <7, 16, 8, 13>
- Cycle 12: <8, 13, 16, 9>
- Cycle 13: <13, 16, 15, 18>
- Cycle 14: <12, 0, 19, 6>
- Cycle 15: <0, 11, 18, 3>
- Cycle 16: <11, 17, 6, 3>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, we find that Cycle 1: <5, 9, 17, 4> has exactly one chord which is edge (9, 4).
So, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <5, 9, 17, 4>.

Step 3:
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the count of chordless cycles is [0].
