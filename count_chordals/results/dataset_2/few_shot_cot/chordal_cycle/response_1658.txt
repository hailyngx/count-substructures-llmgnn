Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 11, 13, 3, 0> with edges (0, 11), (11, 13), (13, 3), (3, 0)
- <0, 11, 13, 6, 9, 1, 0> with edges (0, 11), (11, 13), (13, 6), (6, 9), (9, 1), (1, 0)
- <0, 14, 3, 13, 11, 2, 0> with edges (0, 14), (14, 3), (3, 13), (13, 11), (11, 2), (2, 0)
- <1, 9, 5, 9, 6, 14, 0, 1> with edges (1, 9), (9, 5), (5, 9), (9, 6), (6, 14), (14, 0), (0, 1)
- <2, 11, 13, 6, 9, 1, 0, 2> with edges (2, 11), (11, 13), (13, 6), (6, 9), (9, 1), (1, 0), (0, 2)
- <3, 7, 6, 9, 1, 0, 14, 3> with edges (3, 7), (7, 6), (6, 9), (9, 1), (1, 0), (0, 14), (14, 3)
- <4, 11, 13, 3, 14, 7, 2, 4> with edges (4, 11), (11, 13), (13, 3), (3, 14), (14, 7), (7, 2), (2, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- From the above cycles, <0, 11, 13, 3, 0> has one chord, (11, 3)
- <0, 14, 3, 13, 11, 2, 0> has one chord, (14, 11)
- <1, 9, 5, 9, 6, 14, 0, 1> has one chord, (9, 0)
- <2, 11, 13, 6, 9, 1, 0, 2> has one chord, (11, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [4].
