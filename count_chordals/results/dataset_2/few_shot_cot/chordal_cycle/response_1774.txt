Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph. We will identify which of these cycles are chordal 4-cycles by checking for exactly one chord in each.

- Cycle (11, 29, 15, 5): This cycle has a chord (11, 5).
- Cycle (16, 1, 13, 10): This cycle does not have a chord.
- Cycle (21, 26, 22, 12): This cycle does not have a chord.
- Cycle (4, 19, 8, 0): This cycle does not have a chord.
- Cycle (24, 25, 15, 29): This cycle does not have a chord.
- Cycle (27, 18, 14, 7): This cycle does not have a chord.
- Cycle (2, 29, 15, 9): This cycle does not have a chord.
- Cycle (10, 21, 25, 15): This cycle does not have a chord.
- Cycle (17, 6, 14, 18): This cycle does not have a chord.
- Cycle (23, 24, 0, 8): This cycle does not have a chord.

Step 2:
Based on our analysis above, we have identified one chordal 4-cycle: <11, 29, 15, 5> with chord (11, 5).

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
