Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <0, 7, 19, 18, 9, 1> has exactly one chord 7-9.
- <0, 7, 19, 18, 9, 14> has exactly one chord 7-19.
- <1, 9, 14, 18, 5, 15> has exactly one chord 9-18.
- <1, 9, 14, 18, 5, 11> has exactly one chord 9-18.
- <6, 0, 7, 19, 15, 5, 18, 9> has exactly one chord 0-19.
- <10, 4, 2, 1, 9, 18, 14> has exactly one chord 9-18.
- <10, 4, 2, 1, 9, 18, 5, 15> has exactly one chord 9-18.
- <10, 19, 7, 0, 6, 3, 17, 16> has exactly one chord 0-6.
- <16, 12, 11, 5, 18, 9, 1, 10> has exactly one chord 5-9.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 8 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [8].
