Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle: <0, 2, 12, 1, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 9, 12, 1, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 9, 3, 14, 0>
- Cycle: <2, 12, 1, 13, 2>
- Cycle: <3, 6, 11, 10, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 9, 12, 1, 3>
- Cycle: <4, 13, 1, 7, 4>
- Cycle: <4, 13, 2, 12, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (2, 12), 1, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (9, 12), 1, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (9, 3), 14, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (12, 1), 13, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (6, 11), 10, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (9, 12), 1, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (13, 1), 7, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (13, 2), 12, 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found = 8
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
