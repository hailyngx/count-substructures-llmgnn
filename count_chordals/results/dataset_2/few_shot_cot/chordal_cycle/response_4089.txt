Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- <0, 6, 1, 7> (Chord: (6, 7))
- <0, 7, 1, 6> (Chord: (1, 6))
- <0, 7, 1, 2> (Chord: (1, 2))
- <0, 7, 1, 4> (Chord: (1, 4))
- <0, 7, 1, 9> (Chord: (1, 9))
- <5, 6, 1, 7> (Chord: (6, 7))
- <5, 7, 1, 6> (Chord: (1, 6))
- <5, 7, 1, 2> (Chord: (1, 2))
- <5, 7, 1, 4> (Chord: (1, 4))
- <5, 7, 1, 9> (Chord: (1, 9))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [10].
