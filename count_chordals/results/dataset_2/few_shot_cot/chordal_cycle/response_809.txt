Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 9, 6, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 9, 4, 0>
  
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- In Cycle 1: <1, 3> is a chord
- In Cycle 2: <1, 3> is a chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
