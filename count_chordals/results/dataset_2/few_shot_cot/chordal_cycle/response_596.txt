Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <1, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle 2: <1, 7, 18, 5>
- Cycle 3: <1, 7, 6, 17>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 4, 17>
- Cycle 5: <1, 3, 5, 18>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 9, 2>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 9, 2, 16>
- Cycle 8: <1, 14, 19, 4>
- Cycle 9: <7, 4, 17, 6>
- Cycle 10: <7, 18, 15, 0>
- Cycle 11: <3, 1, 14, 19>
- Cycle 12: <3, 9, 2, 6>
- Cycle 13: <3, 9, 1, 7>
- Cycle 14: <4, 7, 6, 17>
- Cycle 15: <4, 7, 6, 2>
- Cycle 16: <4, 7, 18, 15>
- Cycle 17: <5, 11, 16, 2>
- Cycle 18: <5, 11, 17, 6>
- Cycle 19: <5, 18, 7, 4>
- Cycle 20: <5, 10, 16, 11>
- Cycle 21: <11, 16, 2, 9>
- Cycle 22: <11, 16, 10, 5>
- Cycle 23: <11, 17, 4, 7>
- Cycle 24: <5, 18, 15, 11>
- Cycle 25: <7, 18, 15, 11>

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 9, 2> - Chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 9: <7, 4, 17, 6> - Chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 17: <5, 11, 17, 6> - Chord: (11, 6)
- Cycle 24: <5, 18, 15, 11> - Chord: (18, 11)

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles = [4]
