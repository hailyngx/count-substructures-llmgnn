Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 2, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 19, 11, 14>
- Cycle 3: <1, 2, 11, 14>
- Cycle 4: <2, 9, 3, 10>
- Cycle 5: <3, 13, 9, 0>
- Cycle 6: <3, 10, 14, 17>
- Cycle 7: <3, 12, 14, 17>
- Cycle 8: <4, 15, 6, 17>
- Cycle 9: <5, 10, 14, 17>
- Cycle 10: <5, 7, 17, 14>
- Cycle 11: <6, 17, 16, 6>
- Cycle 12: <6, 7, 17, 14>
- Cycle 13: <6, 15, 8, 14>
- Cycle 14: <6, 15, 18, 17>
- Cycle 15: <7, 17, 14, 11>
- Cycle 16: <7, 18, 15, 8>
- Cycle 17: <8, 14, 11, 19>
- Cycle 18: <8, 12, 3, 9>
- Cycle 19: <10, 14, 8, 15>
- Cycle 20: <11, 14, 17, 6>
- Cycle 21: <12, 3, 13, 9>
- Cycle 22: <12, 14, 17, 6>
- Cycle 23: <15, 6, 16, 17>
- Cycle 24: <15, 18, 17, 7>
- Cycle 25: <16, 17, 7, 18>
- Cycle 26: <17, 14, 8, 12>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <6, 15, 8, 14> (Chord: (6, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <16, 17, 7, 18> (Chord: (16, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <17, 14, 8, 12> (Chord: (17, 8))
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
- There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final number is [3].
