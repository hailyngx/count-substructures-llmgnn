- Cycle 3: 1-4-2-11-7-15-17-14-1
- Cycle 4: 1-4-2-11-7-18-5-4
- Cycle 5: 1-4-19-11-7-18-5-10-19
- Cycle 6: 3-1-8-12-6-7-11-19-3
- Cycle 7: 3-1-8-12-16-2-4-19-3
- Cycle 8: 3-1-4-2-11-7-15-17-3
- Cycle 9: 3-1-4-19-11-7-18-9-3
- Cycle 10: 3-1-4-5-18-7-15-17-3

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycle 1: Cycle 4 (1-4-2-11-7-18-5-4), Chord: (4, 11)
- Chordal cycle 2: Cycle 8 (3-1-4-2-11-7-15-17-3), Chord: (4, 17)
- Chordal cycle 3: Cycle 10 (3-1-4-5-18-7-15-17-3), Chord: (4, 17)
- Chordal cycle 4: Cycle 14 (4-2-16-12-8-15-17-14-4), Chord: (2, 15)
- Chordal cycle 5: Cycle 15 (4-19-1-8-12-6-7-11-4), Chord: (19, 12)
- Chordal cycle 6: Cycle 17 (19-1-4-5-18-7-11-2-19), Chord: (18, 2)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are a total of [17] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<4, (4, 11)>
<8, (4, 17)>
<10, (4, 17)>
<14, (2, 15)>
<15, (19, 12)>
<17, (18, 2)>
