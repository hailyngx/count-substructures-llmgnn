Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. Some of them are:
1. Cycle <5, 1, 4, 7>
2. Cycle <4, 6, 9, 8>
3. Cycle <2, 1, 5, 4>
4. Cycle <3, 5, 6, 9>
and more...

Step 2:
After checking each cycle, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. Chordal 4-cycle <5, 1, 4, 7> with chord (1, 4)
2. Chordal 4-cycle <4, 6, 9, 8> with chord (6, 8)
3. Chordal 4-cycle <2, 1, 5, 4> with chord (2, 5)
4. Chordal 4-cycle <3, 5, 6, 9> with chord (3, 6)
and more...

Step 3:
There are [4] unique chordless 4-cycles found in the graph.
