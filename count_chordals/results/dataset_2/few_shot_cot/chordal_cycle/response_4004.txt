Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 6> (chords: (0, 1))
- Cycle 2: <2, 7, 1, 6> (chords: (2, 1))
- Cycle 3: <4, 9, 3, 1> (chords: (4, 3))
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 1, 3> (chords: (0, 1))
- Cycle 5: <0, 5, 1, 8> (chords: (0, 1))
- Cycle 6: <0, 7, 1, 3> (chords: (0, 1))
- Cycle 7: <0, 7, 1, 8> (chords: (0, 1))
- Cycle 8: <0, 7, 2, 8> (chords: (0, 2))
- Cycle 9: <2, 8, 3, 9> (chords: (2, 3))

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <<2, 7, 1, 6> (chords: (2, 1))>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found with exactly one chord.

So, the final result is [1].
