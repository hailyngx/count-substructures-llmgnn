Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <10, 11, 15, 16> with the chord (10, 15).

Following the steps provided earlier:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycles: <0, 1, 10, 5>, <0, 1, 8, 2>, <0, 4, 6, 7>, <0, 5, 8, 2>, <0, 10, 11, 15>, <0, 4, 5, 10>, <0, 4, 6, 16>, <0, 5, 8, 9>, <0, 10, 11, 18>, <0, 4, 5, 8>, <1, 0, 10, 5>, <2, 8, 5, 4>, <2, 15, 16, 6>, <2, 8, 5, 10>, <3, 12, 19, 18>, <3, 13, 14, 12>, <3, 13, 14, 12, 19>, <4, 0, 10, 11>, <4, 5, 10, 11>, <4, 0, 5, 8>, <4, 0, 6, 16>, <4, 5, 10, 15>, <4, 6, 16, 19>, <4, 0, 1, 10>, <5, 10, 15, 2>, <5, 10, 11, 19>, <6, 7, 17, 18>, <6, 16, 19, 12>, <6, 7, 17, 15>, <6, 7, 15, 16>, <7, 18, 19, 12>, <7, 17, 18, 19>, <7, 17, 15, 16>, <8, 9, 16, 19>, <8, 9, 16, 15>, <8, 9, 16, 6>, <8, 9, 16, 15, 2>, <10, 11, 15, 16>, <10, 11, 18, 7>, <11, 15, 17, 7>, <11, 18, 19, 16>, <12, 14, 13, 3>, <12, 14, 13, 3, 19>, <13, 14, 12, 19>, <13, 14, 12, 3>, <15, 16, 19, 12>, <15, 11, 10, 5>, <15, 11, 10, 0>, <15, 11, 18, 19>, <15, 11, 18, 7>, <16, 17, 7, 6>, <16, 19, 12, 14>, <16, 15, 2, 8>, <16, 15, 2, 8, 9>, <17, 18, 11, 10>, <17, 18, 7, 6>, <18, 19, 16, 15>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <10, 11, 15, 16> with the chord (10, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
