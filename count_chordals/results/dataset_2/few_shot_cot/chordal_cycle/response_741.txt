Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 6 - 5 - 13 - 9 - 2 - 4 - 7 - 11 - 3 - 10 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 4 - 2 - 9 - 13 - 7 - 11 - 1
- Cycle 3: 0 - 8 - 1 - 6 - 5 - 11 - 3 - 14 - 0

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has two chords (5, 9) and (2, 7).
- Cycle 2 has one chord (4, 11).
- Cycle 3 has zero chords.

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, 8, 1, 6>
