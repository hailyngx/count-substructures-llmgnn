Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 5-6-3-5
- Cycle 2: 5-8-6-5
- Cycle 3: 5-2-1-5
- Cycle 4: 5-3-4-0-5
- Cycle 5: 3-0-8-5-3
- Cycle 6: 3-0-7-9-3
- Cycle 7: 3-7-1-5-3
- Cycle 8: 1-7-2-5-1
- Cycle 9: 1-2-5-8-1
- Cycle 10: 1-9-4-3-1

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 <5, 6, 3, 5>: Chord 5-3
- Cycle 2 <5, 8, 6, 5>: Chord 5-6
- Cycle 3 <5, 2, 1, 5>: Chord 5-1
- Cycle 4 <5, 3, 4, 0, 5>: No chord
- Cycle 5 <3, 0, 8, 5, 3>: Chord 3-8
- Cycle 6 <3, 0, 7, 9, 3>: No chord
- Cycle 7 <3, 7, 1, 5, 3>: Chord 3-1
- Cycle 8 <1, 7, 2, 5, 1>: Chord 1-2
- Cycle 9 <1, 2, 5, 8, 1>: Chord 1-8
- Cycle 10 <1, 9, 4, 3, 1>: Chord 1-4

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<5, 6, 3, 5>
<5, 8, 6, 5>
<5, 2, 1, 5>
<3, 0, 8, 5, 3>
<3, 7, 1, 5, 3>
<1, 9, 4, 3, 1>
