Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 18, 20, 5>
- Cycle 2: <15, 3, 7, 22, 2, 14, 5, 24, 13, 28, 19, 15>
- Cycle 3: <4, 8, 16, 14, 2, 22, 29, 7, 15, 4>
- Cycle 4: <28, 21, 10, 18, 20, 23, 1, 19, 15, 28>
- Cycle 5: <26, 19, 15, 7, 22, 29, 11, 17, 26>
- Cycle 6: <0, 23, 1, 19, 28, 13, 24, 5, 11, 21, 14, 16, 8, 4, 15, 3, 27, 7, 10, 20, 23>
- Cycle 7: <9, 20, 18, 10, 21, 14, 16, 4, 15, 3, 7, 29, 22, 0, 28, 13, 24, 5, 9>
- Cycle 8: <11, 5, 9, 20, 23, 0, 28, 19, 15, 7, 10, 21, 14, 2, 22, 29, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: Chord = (9, 20)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: Chord = (7, 22)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: Chord = (2, 14)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: Chord = (21, 10)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: Chord = (19, 15)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: Chord = (24, 13)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: Chord = (9, 20)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: Chord = (5, 11)

Step 3: After checking for exactly one chord in each cycle, the number of chordal 4-cycles found is [7].
