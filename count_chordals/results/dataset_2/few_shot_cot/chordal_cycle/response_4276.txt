Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 9, 8, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 7, 3, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 6, 1, 7, 3, 2, 0)
- Cycle 4: (2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 6, 1, 7, 3, 2)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 4: (2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 6, 1, 7, 3, 2) with chord (9, 5)
  
Step 3:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found: <2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 6, 1, 7, 3, 2> with chord (9, 5)

Therefore, the total number of chordless cycles is [0].
