Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, 1, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 2, 4, 9>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 3, 6>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 2, 4>
- Cycle 6: <2, 4, 9, 3>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 8: <3, 4, 9, 2>
- Cycle 9: <4, 9, 2, 6>
- Cycle 10: <4, 9, 3, 5>

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <5, 1>
- Cycle 2 has a chord <2, 4>
- Cycle 3 has a chord <1, 5>
- Cycle 4 has a chord <5, 3>
- Cycle 5 has a chord <6, 4>
- Cycle 6 has a chord <4, 9>
- Cycle 7 has a chord <1, 4>
- Cycle 8 has a chord <4, 9>
- Cycle 9 has a chord <4, 2>
- Cycle 10 has a chord <4, 3>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
- There are 10 cycles in total, out of which 10 have exactly one chord.
- So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
