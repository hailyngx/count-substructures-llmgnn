Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles in the given graph, but we will consider only the cycles of length 4 for this chordal cycle problem.
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle: 0 - 9 - 5 - 4 - 0
2. Cycle: 0 - 9 - 8 - 3 - 0
3. Cycle: 0 - 13 - 9 - 5 - 0
4. Cycle: 0 - 13 - 8 - 3 - 0
5. Cycle: 5 - 9 - 13 - 4 - 5
6. Cycle: 5 - 6 - 13 - 4 - 5
7. Cycle: 3 - 8 - 9 - 13 - 3

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, only the cycle 0 - 9 - 5 - 4 - 0 has exactly one chord (9, 5).

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<0, 9, 5, 4> with chord (9, 5)
