6. <1, 4, 8, 9>
7. <1, 7, 4, 8>
8. <1, 3, 5, 0>
9. <1, 8, 2, 9>
10. <2, 3, 6, 9>
11. <2, 4, 7, 9>
12. <2, 9, 1, 8>

Step 2:
Chordal cycles with exactly one non-adjacent chord:
1. <0, 4, 7, 9>
   Chord: (0, 9)
2. <0, 1, 7, 9>
   Chord: (1, 9)
3. <0, 3, 1, 9>
   Chord: (3, 9)
4. <0, 1, 3, 5>
   Chord: (1, 5)
5. <0, 3, 6, 9>
   Chord: (3, 6)
6. <1, 4, 8, 9>
   Chord: (4, 8)
7. <1, 7, 4, 8>
   Chord: (7, 8)
8. <1, 3, 5, 0>
   Chord: (5, 0)
9. <1, 8, 2, 9>
   Chord: (2, 9)
10. <2, 3, 6, 9>
    Chord: (3, 6)
11. <2, 4, 7, 9>
    Chord: (4, 7)
12. <2, 9, 1, 8>
    Chord: (1, 8)
13. <3, 5, 0, 1>
    Chord: (0, 1)
14. <3, 6, 9, 8>
    Chord: (6, 8)
15. <4, 8, 1, 7>
    Chord: (1, 7)
16. <4, 7, 9, 6>
    Chord: (7, 9)
17. <5, 0, 3, 1>
    Chord: (0, 3)
18. <6, 9, 8, 2>
    Chord: (8, 2)
19. <7, 9, 6, 4>
    Chord: (6, 4)
20. <8, 9, 2, 4>
    Chord: (2, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we have found 20 unique chordal 4-cycles. 
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [20].
