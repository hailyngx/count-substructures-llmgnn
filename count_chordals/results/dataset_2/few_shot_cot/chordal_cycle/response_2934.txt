Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 7, 2>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 1, 8>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 8, 9>
- Cycle 6: <0, 9, 8, 6>
- Cycle 7: <1, 5, 7, 6>
- Cycle 8: <1, 5, 7, 2>
- Cycle 9: <1, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle 10: <1, 5, 7, 1>
- Cycle 11: <1, 3, 2, 7>
- Cycle 12: <1, 3, 2, 0>
- Cycle 13: <1, 3, 2, 6>
- Cycle 14: <1, 3, 4, 7>
- Cycle 15: <1, 3, 4, 9>
- Cycle 16: <1, 3, 4, 8>
- Cycle 17: <1, 3, 8, 9>
- Cycle 18: <1, 3, 8, 6>
- Cycle 19: <1, 3, 8, 4>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- In cycle 1 <0, 6, 1, 5>, there is no chord.
- In cycle 2 <0, 6, 7, 4>, the chord is (6, 4).
- In cycle 3 <0, 6, 7, 2>, the chord is (6, 7).
- In cycle 4 <0, 6, 1, 8>, the chord is (6, 1).
- In cycle 5 <0, 6, 8, 9>, there is no chord.
- In cycle 6 <0, 9, 8, 6>, the chord is (9, 8).
- In cycle 7 <1, 5, 7, 6>, the chord is (5, 7).
- In cycle 8 <1, 5, 7, 2>, the chord is (5, 7).
- In cycle 9 <1, 5, 7, 4>, the chord is (5, 7).
- In cycle 10 <1, 5, 7, 1>, the chord is (5, 7).
- In cycle 11 <1, 3, 2, 7>, the chord is (3, 2).
- In cycle 12 <1, 3, 2, 0>, there is no chord.
- In cycle 13 <1, 3, 2, 6>, the chord is (3, 2).
- In cycle 14 <1, 3, 4, 7>, the chord is (3, 4).
- In cycle 15 <1, 3, 4, 9>, the chord is (3, 4).
- In cycle 16 <1, 3, 4, 8>, the chord is (3, 4).
- In cycle 17 <1, 3, 8, 9>, the chord is (3, 8).
- In cycle 18 <1, 3, 8, 6>, the chord is (3, 8).
- In cycle 19 <1, 3, 8, 4>, the chord is (3, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
