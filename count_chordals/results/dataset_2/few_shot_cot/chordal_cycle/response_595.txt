Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2)

Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 1, 4, 9>
- <0, 1, 8, 9>
- <0, 4, 8, 9>
- <1, 4, 9, 5>
- <1, 4, 8, 9>
- <1, 6, 3, 4>
- <1, 8, 3, 4>
- <2, 0, 1, 4>
- <2, 0, 4, 8>
- <2, 0, 4, 9>
- <2, 5, 9, 8>
- <2, 6, 1, 4>
- <2, 6, 3, 4>
- <3, 4, 8, 9>
- <3, 6, 1, 4>
- <3, 6, 2, 0>
- <3, 7, 8, 9>
- <4, 1, 8, 9>
- <4, 2, 0, 1>
- <4, 2, 6, 3>
- <4, 2, 6, 1>
- <4, 3, 8, 9>
- <5, 9, 8, 4>
- <6, 1, 8, 9>
- <6, 2, 0, 1>
- <6, 2, 4, 9>
- <7, 3, 6, 1>
- <7, 3, 4, 8>
- <7, 8, 9, 4>
- <8, 1, 4, 9>
- <8, 3, 4, 9>
- <8, 7, 2, 0>
- <9, 5, 2, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 4, 9> - Chord: (1, 4)
- <0, 1, 8, 9> - Chord: (1, 8)
- <0, 4, 8, 9> - Chord: (4, 8)
- <1, 4, 9, 5> - Chord: (4, 5)
- <1, 4, 8, 9> - Chord: (4, 8)
- <1, 6, 3, 4> - Chord: (6, 3)
- <1, 8, 3, 4> - Chord: (8, 3)
- <2, 0, 1, 4> - Chord: (0, 1)
- <2, 0, 4, 8> - Chord: (0, 4)
- <2, 0, 4, 9> - Chord: (0, 4)
- <2, 5, 9, 8> - Chord: (5, 8)
- <2, 6, 1, 4> - Chord: (6, 1)
- <2, 6, 3, 4> - Chord: (6, 3)
- <3, 4, 8, 9> - Chord: (4, 9)
- <3, 6, 1, 4> - Chord: (6, 1)
- <3, 6, 2, 0> - Chord: (6, 2)
- <3, 7, 8, 9> - Chord: (7, 8)
- <4, 1, 8, 9> - Chord: (1, 8)
- <4, 2, 0, 1> - Chord: (2, 0)
- <4, 2, 6, 3> - Chord: (2, 6)
- <4, 2, 6, 1> - Chord: (2, 6)
- <4, 3, 8, 9> - Chord: (3, 8)
- <5, 9, 8, 4> - Chord: (9, 8)
- <6, 1, 8, 9> - Chord: (1, 8)
- <6, 2, 0, 1> - Chord: (2, 0)
- <6, 2, 4, 9> - Chord: (2, 9)
- <7, 3, 6, 1> - Chord: (3, 6)
- <7, 3, 4, 8> - Chord: (3, 8)
- <7, 8, 9, 4> - Chord: (8, 9)
- <8, 1, 4, 9> - Chord: (1, 4)
- <8, 3, 4, 9> - Chord: (3, 4)
- <8, 7, 2, 0> - Chord: (7, 2)
- <9, 5, 2, 0> - Chord: (5, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 32 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [32].
