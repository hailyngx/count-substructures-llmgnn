Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- (0,1,3,14,4)
- (0,1,16,4,6)
- (0,1,16,5,12)
- (0,1,12,7,8)
- (0,15,17,12,5)
- (0,18,12,7,8)
- (1,3,9,4,14)
- (1,12,7,8,9)
- (1,16,4,6,11)
- (2,14,3,9,4)
- (4,6,11,17,15)
- (5,12,7,8,9)
- (5,12,7,8,9,3)
- (5,12,7,8,9,4)
- (5,18,12,7,8)
- (5,18,12,7,8,9)
- (5,16,1,3,9)
- (5,16,1,3,14)
- (5,16,4,9,3)
- (10,11,6,4,14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, (1,16), 4, 6> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

So, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <0, (1,16), 4, 6>.
