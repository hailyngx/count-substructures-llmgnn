Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 4, 7, 5, 0>
- <0, 8, 2, 6, 0>
- <1, 5, 7, 9, 1>
- <2, 6, 7, 4, 3, 2>
- <3, 4, 7, 6, 3>
- <4, 7, 6, 5, 4>
- <5, 7, 6, 3, 5>
- <6, 7, 4, 3, 6>
- <7, 4, 3, 8, 9, 7>
- <8, 9, 7, 6, 2, 8>
- <9, 7, 4, 0, 8, 9>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 7, 5, 0> has one chord: (4, 7)
- <0, 8, 2, 6, 0> has one chord: (2, 8)
- <1, 5, 7, 9, 1> has one chord: (5, 7)
- <2, 6, 7, 4, 3, 2> has one chord: (4, 7)
- <3, 4, 7, 6, 3> has one chord: (4, 7)
- <4, 7, 6, 5, 4> has one chord: (5, 6)
- <5, 7, 6, 3, 5> has one chord: (3, 6)
- <6, 7, 4, 3, 6> has one chord: (4, 7)
- <7, 4, 3, 8, 9, 7> has one chord: (8, 9)
- <8, 9, 7, 6, 2, 8> has one chord: (6, 7)
- <9, 7, 4, 0, 8, 9> has one chord: (0, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found to be [11].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 4, 7, 5, 0> (chord: (4, 7))
<0, 8, 2, 6, 0> (chord: (2, 8))
<1, 5, 7, 9, 1> (chord: (5, 7))
<2, 6, 7, 4, 3, 2> (chord: (4, 7))
<3, 4, 7, 6, 3> (chord: (4, 7))
<4, 7, 6, 5, 4> (chord: (5, 6))
<5, 7, 6, 3, 5> (chord: (3, 6))
<6, 7, 4, 3, 6> (chord: (4, 7))
<7, 4, 3, 8, 9, 7> (chord: (8, 9))
<8, 9, 7, 6, 2, 8> (chord: (6, 7))
<9, 7, 4, 0, 8, 9> (chord: (0, 4))
