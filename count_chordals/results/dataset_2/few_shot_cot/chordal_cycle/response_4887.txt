Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles of length 4: <0, 16, 25, 5, 0>, <0, 16, 23, 5, 24, 4, 25, 17, 22, 14, 12, 21, 1, 27, 10, 23, 16, 0>, <1, 8, 17, 22, 0, 16, 29, 26, 25, 4, 24, 1>, <1, 8, 17, 22, 0, 16, 25, 17, 22, 0>, <1, 8, 17, 25, 2, 3, 18, 5, 23, 7, 13, 7, 23, 16, 29, 26, 20, 6, 9, 15, 14, 12, 21, 11, 6, 9, 15, 4, 24, 1>, <1, 8, 17, 25, 16, 29, 19, 0, 22, 0>, <1, 27, 12, 14, 22, 17, 25, 16, 29, 26, 20, 6, 11, 21, 1>, <6, 9, 28, 5, 18, 3, 2, 25, 4, 15, 10, 23, 16, 29, 26, 20, 3, 18, 5, 23, 7, 13, 7, 23, 5, 28, 9, 6>, <12, 21, 11, 6, 20, 26, 29, 16, 23, 10, 15, 4, 24, 5, 28, 9, 6>
- Cycles of length 5: <0, 16, 25, 5, 24, 0>, <0, 16, 29, 26, 20, 19, 0>, <1, 27, 12, 21, 1, 8, 17, 22, 14, 12>
- Cycles of length 6 or more: No additional cycles found.

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the found cycles: 
- <0, 16, 25, 5, 24, 0> has exactly 1 chord: (16, 5)
- <0, 16, 29, 26, 20, 19, 0> has exactly 1 chord: (16, 20)
- <1, 27, 12, 21, 1, 8, 17, 22, 14, 12> has exactly 1 chord: (8, 14)
  
Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]
