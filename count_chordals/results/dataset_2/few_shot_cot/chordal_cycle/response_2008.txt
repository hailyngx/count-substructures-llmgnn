Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, 22, 2, 26>. By going through all the cycles of length 4, where every edge in the cycle exists, we see that this cycle has a single chord (26, 2), making it a chordal 4-cycle.

There is only 1 unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph, so the final count is [1].
