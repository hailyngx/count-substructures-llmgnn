Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<5, 1, 4, 9, 5>
<9, 2, 4, 5, 9>
<6, 3, 0, 7, 6>
<3, 0, 7, 8, 3>
<3, 5, 9, 8, 3>
<3, 6, 2, 9, 3>
<2, 0, 7, 8, 2>
<2, 4, 5, 1, 2>
<4, 0, 3, 6, 4>
<4, 9, 5, 1, 4>
<1, 8, 7, 0, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
<5, 1, 4, 9, 5> (Chord: (1, 9))
<9, 2, 4, 5, 9> (Chord: (2, 5))
<3, 0, 7, 8, 3> (Chord: (0, 8))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [0] chordless cycles in the given graph.
