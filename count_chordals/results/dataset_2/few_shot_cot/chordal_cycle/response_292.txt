Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (3, 1, 9, 5)
2. (3, 1, 6, 8)
3. (3, 2, 5, 8)
4. (3, 2, 8, 6)
5. (1, 9, 5, 2)
6. (1, 9, 8, 6)
7. (1, 6, 3, 0)
8. (1, 6, 8, 3)
9. (9, 1, 3, 0)
10. (9, 1, 6, 8)
11. (5, 9, 1, 3)
12. (5, 9, 8, 6)
13. (8, 5, 2, 3)
14. (8, 5, 9, 4)
15. (8, 4, 5, 2)
16. (8, 4, 0, 3)
17. (8, 3, 1, 9)
18. (8, 3, 2, 5)
19. (8, 3, 0, 4)
20. (8, 6, 1, 3)
21. (8, 6, 3, 0)
22. (6, 1, 9, 5)
23. (6, 1, 3, 0)
24. (6, 3, 2, 5)
25. (6, 3, 8, 5)
  
Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:
1. <3, 1, 9, 5> (Chord: (1, 9))
2. <3, 2, 5, 8> (Chord: (2, 5))
3. <8, 4, 0, 3> (Chord: (0, 3))

Step 3:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
