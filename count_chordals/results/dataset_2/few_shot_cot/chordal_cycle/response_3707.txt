Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
  - <0, 7, 14, 4>, with chord 12
  - <0, 7, 12, 13>, with chord 11
  - <1, 3, 13, 12>, with chord 4
  - <1, 3, 7, 2>, with chord 10
  - <1, 14, 9, 4>, with chord 12
  - <3, 7, 12, 9>, with chord 4
  - <3, 13, 12, 9>, with chord 4
  - <4, 9, 12, 13>, with chord 14
  - <4, 14, 9, 10>, with chord 12
  - <7, 2, 10, 6>, with chord 14

Step 2:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
  - <1, 3, 13, 12> 

Step 3:
- The total number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].
