Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 7, 18, 11>, with edges (0, 6), (6, 7), (7, 18), (18, 11), (11, 16), and (16, 1)
- Cycle 2: <3, 17, 14, 13, 1>, with edges (3, 17), (17, 14), (14, 13), (13, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 8)
- Cycle 3: <4, 3, 17, 14, 13>, with edges (4, 3), (3, 17), (17, 14), (14, 13), (13, 1), and (1, 2)
- Cycle 4: <7, 17, 14, 13, 1>, with edges (7, 17), (17, 14), (14, 13), (13, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 8)
- Cycle 5: <10, 4, 3, 17, 14>, with edges (10, 4), (4, 3), (3, 17), (17, 14), (14, 13), and (13, 1)
- Cycle 6: <11, 16, 1, 13, 14>, with edges (11, 16), (16, 1), (1, 13), (13, 14), (14, 17), and (17, 3)
- Cycle 7: <12, 11, 16, 19, 0>, with edges (12, 11), (11, 16), (16, 19), (19, 0), (0, 6), and (6, 7)
- Cycle 8: <17, 14, 13, 1, 2>, with edges (17, 14), (14, 13), (13, 1), (1, 2), (2, 5), and (5, 18)
- Cycle 9: <18, 11, 16, 19, 0>, with edges (18, 11), (11, 16), (16, 19), (19, 0), (0, 6), and (6, 7)
- Cycle 10: <19, 16, 11, 12, 8>, with edges (19, 16), (16, 11), (11, 12), (12, 8), (8, 2), and (2, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 6, 7, 18, 11> has a chord (7, 18)
- <3, 17, 14, 13, 1> has no chords
- <4, 3, 17, 14, 13> has no chords
- <7, 17, 14, 13, 1> has no chords
- <10, 4, 3, 17, 14> has no chords
- <11, 16, 1, 13, 14> has no chords
- <12, 11, 16, 19, 0> has no chords
- <17, 14, 13, 1, 2> has no chords
- <18, 11, 16, 19, 0> has a chord (11, 16)
- <19, 16, 11, 12, 8> has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the count is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 6, 7, 18, 11>
<18, 11, 16, 19, 0>
