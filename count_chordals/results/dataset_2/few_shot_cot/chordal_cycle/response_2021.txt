Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<5, 9, 6, 7>
<5, 9, 6, 11>
<5, 9, 11, 14>
<5, 6, 4, 7>
<5, 6, 4, 12>
<5, 6, 11, 14>
<5, 7, 14, 18>
<5, 14, 11, 19>
<9, 6, 4, 7>
<9, 6, 4, 12>
<9, 6, 7, 14>
<9, 6, 11, 14>
<9, 6, 11, 19>
<9, 11, 14, 7>
<9, 11, 14, 18>
<9, 13, 3, 0>
<9, 13, 0, 1>
<6, 4, 12, 17>
<6, 7, 14, 18>
<6, 11, 19, 10>
<4, 7, 14, 18>
<4, 7, 6, 9>
<4, 12, 17, 10>

<0, 13, 9, 5>
<1, 13, 9, 5>
<1, 13, 0, 9>
<10, 17, 4, 12>
<17, 8, 7, 14>
<17, 10, 19, 11>
<17, 19, 11, 14>

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:

<5, 9, 6, 7> has a unique chord (5, 7)
<5, 6, 11, 14> has a unique chord (6, 14)
<5, 7, 14, 18> has a unique chord (7, 14)
<9, 6, 7, 14> has a unique chord (6, 14)
<9, 6, 11, 14> has a unique chord (6, 14)
<9, 11, 14, 7> has a unique chord (11, 7)
<9, 13, 3, 0> has a unique chord (3, 9)
<6, 11, 19, 10> has a unique chord (11, 10)
<4, 12, 17, 10> has a unique chord (12, 10)
<17, 8, 7, 14> has a unique chord (8, 14)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
