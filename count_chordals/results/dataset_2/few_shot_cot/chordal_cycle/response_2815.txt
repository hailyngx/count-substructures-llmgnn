Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 1, 5, 6>
- <1, 3, 5, 6>
- <1, 4, 6, 7>
- <1, 5, 7, 9>
- <3, 4, 6, 7>
- <3, 5, 7, 9>
- <5, 6, 7, 9>
- <5, 7, 8, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 5, 6> has unique chord (1, 6)
- <1, 3, 5, 6> has no chord
- <1, 4, 6, 7> has unique chord (4, 7)
- <1, 5, 7, 9> has unique chord (5, 9)
- <3, 4, 6, 7> has unique chord (3, 6)
- <3, 5, 7, 9> has no chord
- <5, 6, 7, 9> has no chord
- <5, 7, 8, 9> has unique chord (7, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found
There are 3 chordless cycles found: 
- <1, 3, 5, 6>
- <3, 5, 7, 9>
- <5, 6, 7, 9>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
