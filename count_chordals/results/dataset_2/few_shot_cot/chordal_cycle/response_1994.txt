Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. (5, 4, 1, 10)
2. (5, 4, 8, 13)
3. (5, 4, 9, 14)
4. (5, 4, 8, 6)
5. (5, 4, 8, 7)
6. (5, 4, 1, 12)
7. (5, 13, 3, 11)
8. (5, 13, 11, 2)
9. (5, 13, 11, 7)
10. (5, 13, 8, 4)
11. (5, 13, 8, 14)
12. (5, 13, 8, 6)
13. (5, 12, 1, 10)
14. (5, 12, 11, 1)
15. (5, 12, 11, 2)
16. (9, 4, 8, 13)
17. (9, 4, 8, 7)
18. (9, 4, 1, 12)
19. (9, 13, 8, 4)
20. (9, 13, 8, 14)
21. (9, 13, 8, 6)
22. (9, 14, 9, 10)
23. (9, 14, 10, 6)
24. (9, 14, 10, 8)
25. (9, 14, 8, 13)
26. (9, 10, 1, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<5, (5, 12), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 26 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
