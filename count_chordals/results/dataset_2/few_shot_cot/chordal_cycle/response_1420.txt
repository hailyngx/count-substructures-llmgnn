Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles with 4 or more nodes are:
- Cycle <0, 2, 4, 5>
- Cycle <0, 2, 10, 1>
- Cycle <0, 12, 14, 6>
- Cycle <0, 12, 5, 13>
- Cycle <1, 10, 9, 6>
- Cycle <1, 14, 6, 9>
- Cycle <2, 8, 4, 5>
- Cycle <2, 8, 3, 13>
- Cycle <2, 4, 5, 13>
- Cycle <3, 8, 2, 0>
- Cycle <3, 8, 4, 5>
- Cycle <3, 13, 7, 1>
- Cycle <4, 8, 3, 5>
- Cycle <5, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle <5, 4, 3, 13>
- Cycle <6, 9, 10, 2>
- Cycle <6, 9, 14, 1>
- Cycle <7, 9, 10, 1>
- Cycle <7, 9, 6, 14>
- Cycle <8, 6, 9, 10>
- Cycle <11, 10, 9, 6>
- Cycle <12, 0, 2, 10>
- Cycle <13, 0, 2, 4>
- Cycle <14, 6, 9, 10>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal cycle <0, 2, 10, 1, (14, 6)>
- Chordal cycle <3, 8, 4, 5, (2, 13)>
- Chordal cycle <3, 13, 7, 1, (9, 6)>
- Chordal cycle <11, 10, 9, 6, (14, 1)>
- Chordal cycle <13, 3, 8, 4, (5, 2)>
- Chordal cycle <14, 6, 9, 10, (2, 0)>

Step 3:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [6].
