Response:
Step 1: Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- 4-cycle: <5, 1, 0, 7, 5>
- 4-cycle: <5, 3, 13, 8, 5>
- 4-cycle: <5, 0, 12, 9, 5>
- 4-cycle: <5, 9, 6, 4, 5>
- 4-cycle: <1, 4, 6, 11, 1>
- 4-cycle: <10, 7, 8, 13, 10>
- 4-cycle: <10, 3, 13, 7, 10>
- 4-cycle: <12, 0, 11, 1, 12>
- 4-cycle: <12, 3, 4, 1, 12>
- 4-cycle: <12, 9, 6, 11, 12>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 1, 0, 7, 5> (Chord: (0, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 3, 13, 8, 5> (Chord: (3, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 0, 12, 9, 5> (Chord: (0, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 9, 6, 4, 5> (Chord: (6, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 4, 6, 11, 1> (Chord: (4, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <10, 7, 8, 13, 10> (Chord: (8, 13))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <12, 0, 11, 1, 12> (Chord: (0, 11))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal cycles found:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [7]

Therefore, the final count of unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord in the given graph is [7].
