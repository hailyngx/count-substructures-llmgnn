Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <3, 15, 19, 2>. 

To find the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph, we need to calculate the number of chordal 4-cycles first. Let's go through the steps:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 19, 2)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 13, 2)
- Cycle 3: (3, 4, 9, 19)
- Cycle 4: (15, 13, 2, 17)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 10, 0)
- Cycle 6: (5, 6, 10, 7)
- Cycle 7: (5, 11, 14, 8)
- Cycle 8: (9, 4, 3, 10)
- Cycle 9: (9, 19, 15, 13)
- Cycle 10: (6, 5, 11, 14)
- Cycle 11: (13, 15, 3, 10)
- Cycle 12: (13, 15, 19, 9)
- Cycle 13: (13, 2, 14, 8)
- Cycle 14: (13, 2, 17, 7)
- Cycle 15: (17, 2, 14, 11)
- Cycle 16: (0, 10, 3, 4)
- Cycle 17: (0, 10, 6, 5)
- Cycle 18: (0, 1, 16, 12)
- Cycle 19: (16, 12, 13, 15)
- Cycle 20: (16, 7, 10, 0)
- Cycle 21: (16, 7, 17, 2)
- Cycle 22: (16, 1, 0, 10)
- Cycle 23: (1, 0, 18, 13)
- Cycle 24: (1, 8, 14, 5)
- Cycle 25: (1, 8, 7, 10)
- Cycle 26: (10, 18, 13, 2)
- Cycle 27: (10, 18, 0, 1)
- Cycle 28: (10, 7, 17, 2)
- Cycle 29: (11, 5, 14, 8)
- Cycle 30: (14, 8, 1, 16)
- Cycle 31: (14, 11, 5, 6)
- Cycle 32: (14, 2, 13, 15)
- Cycle 33: (14, 2, 17, 7)
- Cycle 34: (12, 13, 2, 14)
- Cycle 35: (7, 17, 2, 13)
- Cycle 36: (7, 16, 12, 13)
- Cycle 37: (7, 8, 1, 0)
- Cycle 38: (7, 10, 0, 18)
- Cycle 39: (19, 15, 13, 12)
- Cycle 40: (19, 15, 3, 4)
- Cycle 41: (19, 2, 13, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 1: (3, 15, 19, 2) has one chord (15, 2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. As we found only one chordal 4-cycle, the number of chordless cycles is 40.

Therefore, the answer is [40].
