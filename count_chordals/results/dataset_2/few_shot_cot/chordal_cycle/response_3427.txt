Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 4, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 9, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, 7, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 0, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-5-4-1-8-9-0
- Cycle 2: 0-5-2-6-1-8-7-3-0
- Cycle 3: 0-5-3-7-6-1-4-0
- Cycle 4: 1-6-7-3-9-8-1
- Cycle 5: 2-5-0-7-3-9-2
- Cycle 6: 3-7-8-1-4-9-3
- Cycle 7: 4-1-6-7-0-5-4

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <1, (0, 4), 8>
- Cycle 2: <2, (6, 1), 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <2, (5, 1), 0, 7>
- Cycle 4: <1, (7, 9), 8>
- Cycle 5: <1, (2, 7), 0>
- Cycle 6: <2, (3, 8), 1, 7>
- Cycle 7: <1, (5, 0), 4>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [7]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [7].
