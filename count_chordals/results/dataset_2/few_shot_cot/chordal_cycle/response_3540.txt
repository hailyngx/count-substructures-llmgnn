Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 6, 5, 9> (chords: (0, 5), (6, 9))
- Cycle <0, 6, 5, 7> (chords: (0, 7), (5, 7))
- Cycle <0, 6, 8, 13> (chords: (0, 8), (6, 13))
- Cycle <0, 6, 8, 5> (chords: (0, 5), (6, 8))
- Cycle <0, 10, 14, 10> (chords: (0, 14), (10, 10))
- Cycle <0, 7, 12, 11> (chords: (0, 11), (7, 12))
- Cycle <1, 2, 7, 5> (chords: (1, 5), (2, 7))
- Cycle <2, 1, 11, 12> (chords: (2, 12), (1, 11))
- Cycle <2, 4, 13, 8> (chords: (2, 8), (4, 13))

- <0, 6, 5, 7> ✓
- <0, 6, 8, 13> ✓
- <0, 6, 8, 5> ✓
- <0, 10, 14, 10> ✓
- <0, 7, 12, 11> ✓
- <1, 2, 7, 5> ✓
- <2, 1, 11, 12> ✓

- <5, 9, 6, 8> ✓
- <5, 7, 12, 11> ✓
- <6, 5, 8, 13> ✓
- <7, 5, 8, 13> ✓
- <9, 5, 7, 12> ✓
- <9, 4, 13, 10> ✓
- <10, 5, 8, 13> ✓

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 18 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [18].
