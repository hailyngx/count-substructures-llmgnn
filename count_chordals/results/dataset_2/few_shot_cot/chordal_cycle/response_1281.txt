Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 11) (6, 12) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 13) (14, 3) (14, 1) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 1) (3, 14) (3, 8) (3, 11) (3, 7) (3, 4) (11, 9) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 12) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 12) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 11) (12, 4) (12, 10) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 11) (1, 14) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 13) (1, 10)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <5, 13, 2, 1, 14> with a chord (5, 14)
- <5, 13, 2, 4, 12> with a chord (2, 12)
- <5, 13, 1, 14, 3> with a chord (5, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 13, 2, 1, 14> with a chord (5, 14)
- <5, 13, 2, 4, 12> with a chord (2, 12)
- <5, 13, 1, 14, 3> with a chord (5, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, so the number in brackets is [3].
