Response:
There are [10] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:

1. <0, 1, 4, 5> with a chord (4, 12)
2. <0, 2, 8, 7> with a chord (8, 6)
3. <0, 2, 9, 7> with a chord (9, 6)
4. <0, 12, 5, 7> with a chord (5, 2)
5. <1, 4, 5, 11> with a chord (5, 13)
6. <1, 4, 13, 11> with a chord (13, 9)
7. <2, 8, 7, 10> with a chord (7, 6)
8. <2, 8, 12, 0> with a chord (8, 1)
9. <4, 5, 12, 3> with a chord (5, 11)
10. <6, 7, 10, 4> with a chord (10, 1)
