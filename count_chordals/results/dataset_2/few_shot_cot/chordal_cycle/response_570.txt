Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 14, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 11, 5, 13, 9, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 4, 9, 1, 2>
- Cycle 4: <3, 13, 5, 12, 0, 3>
- Cycle 5: <5, 7, 6, 1, 11, 5>
- Cycle 6: <7, 2, 4, 9, 13, 7>
- Cycle 7: <8, 14, 12, 0, 8>
- Cycle 8: <9, 4, 6, 12, 10, 9>
- Cycle 9: <12, 5, 7, 6, 0, 12>
- Cycle 10: <13, 9, 10, 12, 14, 8, 13>

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2: <1, 11, 5, 13, 9, 1>
  Chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 3: <2, 4, 9, 1, 2>
  Chord: (2, 9)
- Cycle 5: <5, 7, 6, 1, 11, 5>
  Chord: (5, 1)
- Cycle 9: <12, 5, 7, 6, 0, 12>
  Chord: (12, 6)

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (1, 9)>
<2, (2, 9)>
<3, (5, 1)>
<4, (12, 6)>
