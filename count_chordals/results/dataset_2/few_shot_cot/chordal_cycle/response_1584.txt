Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Chordal 4-Cycles:
  - <0, 27, 13, 22>, Chord: (13, 22)
  - <0, 27, 13, 4>, Chord: (13, 4)
  - <0, 27, 13, 2>, Chord: (13, 2)
  - <0, 27, 13, 26>, Chord: (13, 26)
  - <27, 13, 22, 26>, Chord: (22, 26)
  - <27, 13, 22, 29>, Chord: (22, 29)
  - <0, 14, 2, 13>, Chord: (14, 2)
  - <23, 8, 20, 24>, Chord: (20, 24)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the number inside brackets is [7].
