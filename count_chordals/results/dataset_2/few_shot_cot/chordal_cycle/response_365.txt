Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle involving nodes 0, 11, 4, 2, 0
- Cycle involving nodes 0, 12, 14, 11, 0
- Cycle involving nodes 0, 12, 14, 2, 0
- Cycle involving nodes 0, 9, 14, 11, 0
- Cycle involving nodes 0, 9, 14, 2, 0
- Cycle involving nodes 0, 9, 1, 8, 0
- Cycle involving nodes 1, 9, 14, 2, 1
- Cycle involving nodes 2, 3, 7, 4, 2
- Cycle involving nodes 3, 7, 9, 14, 3
- Cycle involving nodes 4, 11, 10, 2, 4
- Cycle involving nodes 5, 7, 0, 6, 5
- Cycle involving nodes 6, 3, 4, 11, 6
- Cycle involving nodes 7, 8, 1, 9, 7
- Cycle involving nodes 8, 13, 10, 2, 8
- Cycle involving nodes 9, 0, 8, 13, 9
- Cycle involving nodes 10, 11, 14, 9, 10
- Cycle involving nodes 12, 8, 13, 10, 12
- Cycle involving nodes 13, 10, 11, 4, 13
- Cycle involving nodes 14, 11, 4, 3, 14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- From the above cycles, we find that the cycle <1, 9, 14, 2, 1> has exactly one chord (edge 9-2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Since only one cycle has exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (9, 2), 14>
