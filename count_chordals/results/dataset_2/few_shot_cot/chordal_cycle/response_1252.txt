Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, and node 7

Response:
[4]

The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, 6, 1, 9>.
