Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <5, 1, 9, 5>
- <5, 14, 13, 4>
- <5, 14, 0, 5>
- <5, 14, 3, 1>
- <9, 5, 14, 13>
- <11, 4, 13, 2>
- <11, 4, 13, 7>
- <3, 1, 11, 4>
- <3, 1, 11, 10>
- <3, 14, 13, 4>
- <3, 14, 13, 7>
- <0, 5, 1, 11>
- <0, 5, 14, 13>
- <0, 10, 3, 14>
- <0, 10, 8, 3>
- <7, 3, 10, 11>
- <7, 3, 14, 13>
- <10, 11, 4, 13>
- <10, 0, 5, 1>
- <10, 0, 5, 14>
- <10, 3, 1, 11>
- <10, 3, 14, 13>
- <12, 8, 3, 14>
- <12, 8, 10, 3>
- <13, 2, 6, 0>
- <13, 4, 11, 1>
  
Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <5, 1, 9, 5, (1, 9)>
- <5, 14, 13, 4, (4, 13)>
- <5, 14, 0, 5, (0, 14)>
- <5, 14, 3, 1, (1, 3)>
- <3, 1, 11, 4, (1, 11)>
- <3, 1, 11, 10, (1, 10)>
- <0, 5, 14, 13, (5, 14)>
- <0, 10, 8, 3, (8, 10)>
- <7, 3, 10, 11, (10, 11)>
- <13, 2, 6, 0, (2, 6)>
- <13, 4, 11, 1, (1, 11)>

Step 3:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [11].
