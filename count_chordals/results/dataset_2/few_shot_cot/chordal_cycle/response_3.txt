Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 9, 10)
- Cycle 2: (0, 4, 13, 10)
- Cycle 3: (0, 8, 2, 5)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 7, 12)
- Cycle 5: (1, 12, 9, 14)
- Cycle 6: (2, 0, 11, 5)
- Cycle 7: (2, 3, 8, 0)
- Cycle 8: (3, 2, 8, 0)
- Cycle 9: (3, 7, 12, 1)
- Cycle 10: (4, 0, 2, 5)
- Cycle 11: (4, 9, 12, 5)
- Cycle 12: (4, 13, 14, 9)
- Cycle 13: (5, 11, 3, 1)
- Cycle 14: (6, 11, 0, 8)
- Cycle 15: (7, 1, 12, 9)
- Cycle 16: (10, 9, 12, 5)
- Cycle 17: (10, 13, 4, 9)
- Cycle 18: (11, 5, 0, 8)
- Cycle 19: (11, 10, 13, 4)
- Cycle 20: (12, 4, 9, 14)

- Chordal cycle 4: <1, (3, 7), 12>
- Chordal cycle 5: <1, (9, 14), 12>
- Chordal cycle 6: <2, (0, 11), 5>
- Chordal cycle 7: <2, (8, 0), 5>
- Chordal cycle 8: <3, (2, 8), 0>
- Chordal cycle 9: <3, (7, 12), 1>
- Chordal cycle 10: <4, (9, 12), 5>
