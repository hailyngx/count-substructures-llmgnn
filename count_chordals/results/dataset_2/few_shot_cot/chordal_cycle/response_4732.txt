Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 3, 14, 23, (3, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 13, 27, 21, (13, 21)>

- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, 25, 20, 15, (25, 15)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 25, 20, 29, (25, 29)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <3, 0, 4, 6, (0, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, 0, 13, 27, (0, 27)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, 21, 27, 12, (21, 12)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, 11, 15, 20, (11, 20)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <10, 18, 19, 28, (18, 28)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 13 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
