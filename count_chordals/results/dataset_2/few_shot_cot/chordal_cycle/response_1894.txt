- Cycle 25: <9, 25, 16, 17, 6, 24, 13, 15>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 15, 27, 11, 2, 23, 8, 4> has 2 chords: (27, 23) and (11, 8)
- <3, 7, 25, 16, 21, 17, 6> has 2 chords: (25, 17) and (16, 6)
- <3, 22, 14, 26, 11, 2, 17, 18> has 2 chords: (22, 2) and (14, 18)
- <3, 25, 16, 21, 17, 6, 24, 13> has 2 chords: (25, 17) and (16, 6)
- <9, 25, 16, 17, 6, 24, 13, 15> has 2 chords: (25, 17) and (16, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 20 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [20].
