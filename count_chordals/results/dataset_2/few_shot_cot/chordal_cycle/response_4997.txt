Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <9, 4, 21, 19, 9>
- Cycle 2: <9, 5, 23, 13, 9>
- Cycle 3: <4, 21, 19, 22, 4>
- Cycle 4: <4, 21, 19, 22, 24, 23, 13, 28, 1, 6, 25, 29, 9>
 (Please note that there are multiple cycles, but we are listing only those with a length of 4 or more for this problem.)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- In Cycle 1, no non-adjacent nodes are connected by an edge.
- In Cycle 2, no non-adjacent nodes are connected by an edge.
- In Cycle 3, no non-adjacent nodes are connected by an edge.
- In Cycle 4, a chordal 4-cycle is found: <4, 21, (24), 23, 13, 28, 1, 6, 25, 29, 9>. The edge between nodes 21 and 24 acts as the chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Since only one chordal 4-cycle was found, the final count is [1].
