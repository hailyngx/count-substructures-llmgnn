- Cycle 43: <8, 9, 4, 5>
- Cycle 44: <8, 9, 3, 0>
- Cycle 45: <9, 4, 5, 3>
- Cycle 46: <9, 4, 0, 7>
- Cycle 47: <9, 7, 1, 5>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 10: <2, 6, 5, 1> with the chord (2, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There is 46 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
