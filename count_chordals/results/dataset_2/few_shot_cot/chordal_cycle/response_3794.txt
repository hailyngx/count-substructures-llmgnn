Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are three cycles of length 4 in the graph: <0, 7, 4, 6>, <7, 4, 1, 7>, and <3, 5, 2, 9>.

Step 2:
- The cycle <0, 7, 4, 6> has a chord (edge between nodes 7 and 4), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- The cycle <7, 4, 1, 7> has a chord (edge between nodes 4 and 1), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- The cycle <3, 5, 2, 9> has a chord (edge between nodes 5 and 9), so it is not a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
- There are no chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
