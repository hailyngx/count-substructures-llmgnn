Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <1, 4, 7, 2, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 8, 9, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 5, 6, 3, 2>
- Cycle 5: <2, 5, 6, 4, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 4, 8, 9, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 1, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 8: <3, 1, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 6, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 10: <4, 6, 3, 9, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Out of the cycles listed above, the following chordal 4-cycle is found:
- <1, 4, 8, 9, 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As only 1 chordal 4-cycle is found, the total number of chordless cycles is [9].
