Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 4, 8, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 12, 2, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 7, 14, 10, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 7, 3, 11, 1)
- Cycle 5: (2, 10, 14, 9, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 10, 11, 3, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 12, 5, 4, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 13, 6, 7, 2)
- Cycle 9: (3, 9, 0, 4, 3)
- Cycle 10: (3, 9, 14, 7, 3)
- Cycle 11: (4, 5, 8, 14, 4)
- Cycle 12: (6, 11, 3, 7, 6)
- Cycle 13: (7, 1, 12, 13, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 13, 6, 11, 7)
- Cycle 15: (8, 14, 9, 0, 8)
- Cycle 16: (10, 11, 6, 13, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
Out of the cycles listed above, the cycle <1, 5, 4, 8, 1> has a single chord (1, 4). 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
Since only one cycle has a chord, the number of chordless cycles is [15]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 5, 4, 8, 1>
