Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <1, 4, 3, 8, 1>
- Cycle 2: <2, 4, 3, 8, 2>
- Cycle 3: <4, 1, 6, 2, 4>
- Cycle 4: <5, 2, 4, 8, 5>
- Cycle 5: <6, 1, 2, 6>
- Cycle 6: <7, 1, 6, 0, 7>
- Cycle 7: <8, 4, 1, 6, 8>
- Cycle 8: <9, 8, 3, 4, 9>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: <1, (6, 2), 2, 4, 3, 8, 1>
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: <2, (5, 8), 4, 3, 8, 2>
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: <5, (7, 9), 2, 4, 8, 5>
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: <7, (1, 6), 0, 7>
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: <9, (4, 2), 8, 3, 4, 9>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, (6, 2), 2, 4, 3, 8, 1>
<2, (5, 8), 4, 3, 8, 2>
<5, (7, 9), 2, 4, 8, 5>
