Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 in the graph:

- <0, 3, 7, 11>
- <0, 3, 6, 26>
- <0, 3, 2, 12>
- <0, 13, 26, 4>
- <0, 13, 1, 26>
- <0, 29, 21, 29>
- <1, 13, 26, 19>
- <2, 3, 7, 22>
- <2, 3, 6, 26>
- <2, 3, 12, 28>
- <2, 19, 26, 4>
- <2, 19, 20, 14>
- <3, 7, 22, 10>
- <3, 7, 11, 17>
- <3, 6, 26, 4>
- <4, 18, 17, 11>
- <4, 18, 15, 4>
- <4, 26, 25, 24>
- <4, 26, 13, 1>
- <5, 17, 11, 14>
- <5, 17, 18, 4>
- <5, 27, 25, 26>
- <6, 26, 25, 24>
- <7, 3, 2, 19>
- <8, 11, 17, 5>
- <9, 27, 25, 26>
- <10, 22, 7, 11>
- <10, 22, 10, 28>
- <10, 22, 7, 3>
- <10, 23, 28, 12>
- <10, 23, 28, 2>
- <11, 17, 5, 27>
- <12, 2, 3, 0>
- <12, 2, 19, 20>
- <13, 26, 25, 27>
- <15, 18, 17, 5>
- <16, 24, 25, 26>
- <16, 24, 25, 27>
- <16, 8, 11, 17>
- <16, 8, 11, 14>
- <19, 26, 25, 27>
- <20, 19, 26, 25>
- <21, 0, 29, 12>
- <21, 0, 29, 28>

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 3, 7, 11> has a chord: (3, 11)
- <0, 3, 6, 26> has a chord: (3, 26)
- <0, 13, 26, 4> has a chord: (13, 4)
- <2, 3, 12, 28> has a chord: (3, 12)
- <2, 19, 20, 14> has a chord: (19, 14)
- <3, 7, 11, 17> has a chord: (7, 17)
- <4, 18, 15, 4> has a chord: (18, 15)
- <16, 24, 25, 27> has a chord: (24, 27)

Finally, we count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [42].
