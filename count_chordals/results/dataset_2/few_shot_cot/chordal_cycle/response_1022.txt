- Cycle <1, 9, 15, 5>
- Cycle <2, 4, 3, 14>
- Cycle <2, 11, 0, 13>
- Cycle <2, 11, 13, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 17, 8> (Chord: (0, 17))
- <0, 11, 2, 4> (Chord: (11, 4))
- <1, 8, 17, 5> (Chord: (17, 1))
- <2, 4, 3, 14> (Chord: (4, 14))
- <3, 4, 2, 11> (Chord: (4, 2))
- <5, 0, 13, 11> (Chord: (0, 13))
- <6, 10, 16, 7> (Chord: (10, 7))
- <7, 14, 2, 11> (Chord: (14, 2))
- <8, 17, 5, 15> (Chord: (17, 5))
- <9, 12, 7, 14> (Chord: (12, 7))
- <10, 6, 12, 16> (Chord: (6, 12))
- <13, 0, 11, 2> (Chord: (0, 11))
- <14, 2, 11, 13> (Chord: (2, 11))
- <17, 8, 4, 3> (Chord: (8, 3))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
- There are 14 chordal 4-cycles found.

Final count: [14]
