Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 15: 1-2-0-9-1 has chord (0, 9)
- Cycle 19: 3-4-7-0-3 has chord (7, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 27 chordless cycles found, thus the answer is [27].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found: 
<1, (0, 9), 2)>
<3, (7, 0), 4)>
