Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph, but for chordal 4-cycles, we are interested in cycles with exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle). Here is one unique chordal 4-cycle found:

<5, 1, 2, 6> with chord (1, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is one unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
