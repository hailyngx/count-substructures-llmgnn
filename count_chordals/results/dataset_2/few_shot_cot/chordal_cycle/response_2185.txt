Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 4) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 4) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in this graph, but not all of them can form chordal 4-cycles. Here are the ones with exactly one chord:
<6, 1, 3, 5> chord: (1, 3)
<6, 1, 4, 5> chord: (1, 5)
<6, 1, 8, 5> chord: (1, 8)
<6, 3, 1, 5> chord: (3, 1)
<6, 3, 5, 1> chord: (3, 5)
<6, 9, 2, 3> chord: (9, 2)
<6, 9, 2, 5> chord: (9, 2)
<6, 9, 2, 7> chord: (9, 2)
<6, 9, 5, 2> chord: (9, 5)
<6, 9, 5, 4> chord: (9, 5)
<3, 1, 5, 2> chord: (1, 5)
<3, 1, 5, 4> chord: (1, 5)
<3, 1, 5, 7> chord: (1, 5)
<3, 1, 8, 5> chord: (1, 8)
<1, 4, 2, 5> chord: (4, 2)

Step 2: 
There are 15 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [15].
