Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 13, 8, 4)
- Cycle 2: (8, 13, 6, 9, 28, 24, 17, 27, 11, 8)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 13, 5, 11, 21, 12, 23, 26, 24, 28, 13, 8, 27, 17, 24, 26, 23, 12, 0)
- Cycle 4: (2, 29, 8, 13, 6, 7, 16, 15, 3, 19, 0, 18, 14, 29, 2)
- Cycle 5: (7, 6, 0, 18, 14, 29, 2, 18, 1, 8, 27, 20, 22, 25, 7)
- Cycle 6: (3, 15, 16, 7, 25, 22, 12, 21, 10, 12, 23, 26, 24, 17, 27, 11, 5, 4, 8, 1, 18, 0, 19, 25, 22, 20, 27, 24, 28, 9, 6, 13, 5, 11)
- Cycle 7: (15, 3, 19, 0, 11, 27, 8, 13, 28, 24, 26, 23, 12, 21, 11)
- Cycle 8: (16, 7, 6, 13, 28, 24, 17, 27, 8, 4, 5, 11, 21, 12, 23, 26, 24, 17, 27, 20, 22, 25, 19, 3, 15)

Step 2: Chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <Cycle 1, (5, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <Cycle 4, (8, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <Cycle 5, (0, 18)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <Cycle 7, (19, 27)>

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles = 8
Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles is [4].
