Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 6, 3, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 7, 6, 3, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 9, 6, 7, 4, 8, 2>
- Cycle 5: <4, 7, 6, 9, 5, 8, 4>
- Cycle 6: <5, 9, 2, 1, 4, 8, 5>
- Cycle 7: <5, 9, 6, 7, 8, 5>
- Cycle 8: <8, 5, 9, 6, 7, 4, 8>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Checking cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 3, 0> does not have any chords.
- Checking cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 6, 3, 0> has a chord (4, 6).
- Checking cycle 3: <1, 4, 7, 6, 3, 1> has a chord (4, 3).
- Checking cycle 4: <2, 9, 6, 7, 4, 8, 2> has a chord (9, 8).
- Checking cycle 5: <4, 7, 6, 9, 5, 8, 4> has a chord (7, 5).
- Checking cycle 6: <5, 9, 2, 1, 4, 8, 5> has a chord (9, 8).
- Checking cycle 7: <5, 9, 6, 7, 8, 5> has a chord (9, 6).
- Checking cycle 8: <8, 5, 9, 6, 7, 4, 8> has a chord (5, 9).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
Out of the 8 cycles listed, 1 cycle does not have any chords.

Final count: [1]
