Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

1. <0, 4, 5, 1>
2. <0, 4, 2, 3>
3. <0, 4, 5, 9>
4. <0, 6, 7, 1>
5. <0, 6, 2, 3>
6. <0, 6, 7, 9>
7. <1, 5, 9, 3>
8. <1, 7, 9, 5>
9. <2, 4, 5, 8>
10. <2, 4, 1, 7>
11. <2, 3, 6, 7>
12. <3, 5, 9, 7>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles: 
- <0, 4, 5, 1> with chord (4, 1)
- <0, 6, 7, 1> with chord (6, 1)
- <1, 5, 9, 3> with chord  (5, 3)
- <2, 4, 5, 8> with chord (4, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [8].
