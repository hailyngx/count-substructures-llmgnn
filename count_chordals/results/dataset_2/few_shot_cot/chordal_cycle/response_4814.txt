Response:
Step 1: 
We can identify the following cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: (0, 14, 9, 4, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 14, 19, 13, 17, 4, 12, 15, 5, 1, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 16, 10, 3, 11, 13, 19, 14, 5, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 9, 14, 5, 7, 16, 10, 6, 9)
- Cycle 5: (8, 18, 15, 5, 14, 9, 4, 17, 12, 15, 18)

Step 2: 
After analyzing each cycle, we find that Cycle 4: (2, 9, 14, 5, 7, 16, 10, 6, 9) has exactly one chord (6, 14).

Step 3: 
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is therefore [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<2, (6, 14), 9, 5, 7>
