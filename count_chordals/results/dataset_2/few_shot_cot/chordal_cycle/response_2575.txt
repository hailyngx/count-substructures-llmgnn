Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 1, 3>
- <0, 5, 1, 4>
- <0, 5, 3, 7>
- <1, 5, 0, 3>
- <1, 5, 3, 7>
- <1, 6, 9, 4>
- <1, 6, 9, 7>
- <1, 6, 7, 3>
- <1, 3, 7, 0>
- <1, 3, 7, 9>
- <2, 9, 6, 1>
- <2, 9, 4, 1>
- <2, 9, 4, 3>
- <2, 9, 3, 8>

- <7, 9, 6, 1>
- <7, 9, 6, 3>
- <7, 0, 5, 1>
- <7, 0, 5, 3>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <2, 9, 6, 1> (2, 6 is the chord)
- <3, 5, 1, 6> (5, 6 is the chord)

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [26]
