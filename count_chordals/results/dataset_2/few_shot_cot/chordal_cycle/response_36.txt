Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 6, 4> with edges (0,7), (7,6), (6,4), (4,2), (2,0)
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 5, 1> with edges (0,7), (7,5), (5,1), (1,3), (3,0)
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 9, 4> with edges (0,7), (7,9), (9,4), (4,2), (2,0)
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 4, 2> with edges (0,6), (6,4), (4,2), (2,0)
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 8, 2> with edges (1,5), (5,8), (8,2), (2,4), (4,1)
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 7, 6> with edges (1,5), (5,7), (7,6), (6,4), (4,1)
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 4, 2> with edges (1,6), (6,4), (4,2), (2,8), (8,1)
- Cycle 8: <1, 8, 5, 7> with edges (1,8), (8,5), (5,7), (7,0), (0,1)
- Cycle 9: <2, 0, 7, 5> with edges (2,0), (0,7), (7,5), (5,1), (1,2)
- Cycle 10: <2, 4, 6, 0> with edges (2,4), (4,6), (6,0), (0,3), (3,2)
- Cycle 11: <3, 0, 7, 5> with edges (3,0), (0,7), (7,5), (5,1), (1,3)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord (0,2)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (0,1)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (0,9)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (0,6)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (1,2)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (1,4)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (1,2)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (1,7)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (2,5)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (0,3)
- Cycle 11 has a chord (0,3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [11]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, 6, 4, 2>
- <0, 6, 7, 5>
- <0, 6, 7, 9>
- <0, 7, 5, 1>
- <0, 7, 6, 4>
- <1, 5, 7, 6>
- <1, 6, 4, 2>
- <1, 6, 7, 5>
- <1, 8, 5, 7>
- <2, 0, 7, 5>
- <2, 4, 6, 0>
