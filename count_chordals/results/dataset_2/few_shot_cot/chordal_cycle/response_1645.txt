Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is:

<1, (3, 14), 6)

Here's the calculation for the number of chordal 4-cycles:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- (1, 6, 12, 11, 1)
- (1, 6, 3, 1)
- (1, 7, 11, 2, 8, 7, 1)
- (3, 1, 6, 3)
- (4, 7, 1, 6, 12, 11, 4)
- (4, 10, 0, 8, 7, 4)
- (5, 9, 13, 14, 1, 7, 8, 5)
- (6, 1, 7, 8, 5, 9, 13, 6)
- (7, 4, 11, 2, 8, 5, 9, 7)
- (10, 0, 2, 8, 7, 1, 6, 10)
- (12, 6, 3, 1, 7, 8, 12)
- (14, 9, 7, 1, 6, 12, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Only the cycle (1, 6, 12, 11, 1) has exactly one chord hidden within it, which is (3, 14).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, there is 1 chordal 4-cycle, so the count is [1].
