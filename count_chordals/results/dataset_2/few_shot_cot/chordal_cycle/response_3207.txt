Response:
Step 1: All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <0, 16, 1, 14, 7, 9, 8>
        - <0, 16, 1, 14, 7, 3, 17>
        - <0, 16, 1, 10, 3, 17, 14>
        - <0, 16, 1, 10, 5, 9, 8>
        - <0, 16, 15, 6, 14, 17, 3>
        - <0, 8, 15, 6, 14, 17, 3>
        - <2, 11, 18, 3, 17, 14, 7>
        
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - <0, 16, 1, 14, 7, 9, 8> (Chord: (14, 9))
        - <0, 16, 1, 14, 7, 3, 17> (Chord: (14, 17))
        - <0, 16, 1, 10, 3, 17, 14> (Chord: (3, 14))
        - <0, 16, 1, 10, 5, 9, 8> (Chord: (1, 8))
        - <0, 16, 15, 6, 14, 17, 3> (Chord: (6, 17))
        - <0, 8, 15, 6, 14, 17, 3> (Chord: (8, 6))
        - <2, 11, 18, 3, 17, 14, 7> (Chord: (14, 3))
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
         = [0]
