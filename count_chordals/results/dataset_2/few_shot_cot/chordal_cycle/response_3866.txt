Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 9, 2, 8>
- Cycle 3: <4, 7, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 4: <4, 7, 5, 8, 2>
- Cycle 5: <5, 7, 4, 8, 2>
- Cycle 6: <5, 6, 7, 4, 9>
- Cycle 7: <7, 6, 1, 5, 8>
- Cycle 8: <9, 4, 7, 6, 1>
- Cycle 9: <9, 4, 8, 5, 1>
- Cycle 10: <9, 4, 5, 7, 6>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- In Cycle 1, there is no chord.
- In Cycle 2, there is no chord.
- In Cycle 3, the chord is (7, 5).
- In Cycle 4, the chord is (4, 8).
- In Cycle 5, the chord is (4, 8).
- In Cycle 6, there is no chord.
- In Cycle 7, the chord is (7, 5).
- In Cycle 8, the chord is (4, 8).
- In Cycle 9, the chord is (4, 8).
- In Cycle 10, there is no chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
