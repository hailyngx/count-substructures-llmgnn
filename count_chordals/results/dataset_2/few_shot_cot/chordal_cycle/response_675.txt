Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

1. 0-9-4-1-0
2. 2-9-4-8-2
3. 2-9-1-4-2
4. 6-1-4-8-6
5. 6-1-3-4-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<2, (9, 4)>
<3, (9, 1)>
<4, (1, 4)>
<5, (1, 4)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
