Response:
Step 1:  
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 9, 1, 12, 2>
- <0, 9, 1, 13, 7, 2>
- <0, 9, 5, 4, 11, 10>
- <0, 9, 3, 8, 5, 4>
- <1, 9, 5, 8, 3, 0>
- <1, 9, 3, 8, 0, 11>
- <1, 9, 3, 0, 10, 7>
- <1, 9, 0, 11, 4, 14>
- <2, 4, 5, 8, 0, 3>
- <2, 4, 5, 9, 1, 12>
- <2, 4, 11, 0, 10, 6>
- <6, 10, 0, 9, 5, 4>
- <6, 10, 0, 9, 1, 13>
- <6, 10, 11, 4, 5, 8>
- <6, 10, 11, 0, 3, 8>
- <8, 5, 9, 1, 13, 7>
- <8, 5, 9, 3, 0, 10>
- <8, 5, 4, 11, 0, 3>
- <11, 4, 5, 8, 3, 0>
- <11, 4, 5, 9, 1, 12>
- <11, 4, 14, 13, 1, 9>
- <13, 14, 4, 5, 8, 3>

Step 2:  
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 1, (12), 2>
- <0, 9, 1, 13, (7), 2>
- <0, 9, (5), 4, 11, 10>
- <0, 9, 3, 8, (5), 4>
- <1, 9, (5), 8, 3, 0>
- <1, 9, 3, 8, 0, (11)>
- <1, 9, 3, 0, 10, (7)>
- <1, 9, 0, (11), 4, 14>
- <2, 4, 5, 8, 0, (3)>
- <2, 4, 5, 9, 1, (12)>
- <2, 4, 11, 0, (10), 6>
- <6, 10, 0, 9, (5), 4>
- <6, 10, 0, 9, 1, (13)>
- <6, 10, 11, 4, 5, (8)>
- <6, 10, 11, 0, 3, (8)>

- <11, 4, 5, 8, 3, (0)>
- <11, 4, 5, 9, 1, (12)>
- <11, 4, 14, 13, 1, (9)>
- <13, 14, 4, 5, 8, (3)>
