Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 13, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 10, 11, 3>
- Cycle 3: <0, 10, 12, 2>
- Cycle 4: <0, 12, 2, 14>
- Cycle 5: <0, 12, 1, 8>
- Cycle 6: <1, 8, 13, 4>
- Cycle 7: <2, 10, 11, 3>
- Cycle 8: <2, 10, 14, 11>
- Cycle 9: <2, 14, 9, 11>
- Cycle 10: <3, 5, 13, 8>
- Cycle 11: <3, 11, 14, 9>
- Cycle 12: <4, 13, 8, 1>
- Cycle 13: <4, 13, 6, 8>
- Cycle 14: <4, 9, 14, 11>
- Cycle 15: <5, 3, 11, 10>
- Cycle 16: <6, 13, 8, 1>
- Cycle 17: <7, 3, 11, 10>
- Cycle 18: <7, 9, 14, 11>
- Cycle 19: <9, 11, 10, 5>
- Cycle 20: <9, 11, 3, 7>
- Cycle 21: <9, 14, 2, 12>

Step 2: Checking cycles for a chord:
- <0, 5, 13, 4> is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord 5-13.
- <2, 10, 11, 3> is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord 10-11.
- <3, 11, 14, 9> is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord 11-9.
- <7, 3, 11, 10> is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord 3-11.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 21 cycles in total, and 4 of them are chordal cycles.
- So, there are 21 - 4 = 17 chordless cycles.

Final result: [17]
