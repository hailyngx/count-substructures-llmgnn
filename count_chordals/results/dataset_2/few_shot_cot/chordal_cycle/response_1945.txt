Response:
After listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, we find the following chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord:

Step 1: List of Cycles:
- <5, 9, 10, 3, 5>
- <5, 9, 7, 4, 5>
- <5, 9, 12, 13, 5>
- <5, 9, 12, 14, 5>
- <5, 8, 13, 12, 5>
- <5, 8, 13, 2, 5>
- <5, 6, 2, 13, 5>
- <5, 6, 2, 14, 5>
- <9, 7, 11, 10, 9>
- <9, 7, 11, 14, 9>
- <9, 12, 13, 8, 9>
- <9, 12, 14, 7, 9>
- <10, 11, 7, 4, 10>
- <10, 11, 14, 12, 10>
- <5, 9, 7, 0, 5>
- <5, 8, 13, 2, 6, 5>
- <5, 3, 2, 14, 5>
- <5, 3, 6, 11, 5>
- <9, 7, 0, 6, 9>
- <9, 12, 14, 2, 13, 9>
- <10, 11, 0, 1, 10>

Step 2: Chordal 4-Cycles:
- <5, 9, 10, 3, 5> has chord (9, 3)

Hence, there is one unique chordal 4-cycle found. Therefore, the final count is [1].
