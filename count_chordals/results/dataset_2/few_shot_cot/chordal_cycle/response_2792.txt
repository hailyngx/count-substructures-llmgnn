Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 2, 17, 4, 5, 13, 3>
- Cycle 2: <1, 7, 3, 13, 5, 14>
- Cycle 3: <2, 17, 4, 19, 6, 11>
- Cycle 4: <2, 11, 0, 1, 7, 3>
- Cycle 5: <3, 4, 17, 16, 5, 13>
- Cycle 6: <4, 5, 16, 17>
- Cycle 7: <4, 3, 7, 12>
- Cycle 8: <5, 13, 10, 9, 18>
- Cycle 9: <6, 11, 0, 1, 7>
- Cycle 10: <7, 1, 14, 5, 16>
- Cycle 11: <8, 7, 3, 13, 18>
- Cycle 12: <9, 10, 13, 5, 14>
- Cycle 13: <9, 18, 8, 7, 1>
- Cycle 14: <11, 0, 1, 7, 12>
- Cycle 15: <13, 3, 7, 1, 14>
- Cycle 16: <15, 17, 2, 11, 6>
- Cycle 17: <16, 17, 4, 19, 6>
- Cycle 18: <17, 2, 11, 0, 1>
- Cycle 19: <18, 9, 10, 13, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 11, 2, 17, 4, 5, 13, 3> with chord (4, 17)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 7, 3, 13, 5, 14> with chord (3, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, 17, 4, 19, 6, 11> with chord (4, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, 11, 0, 1, 7, 3> with chord (1, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, 4, 17, 16, 5, 13> with chord (4, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, 5, 16, 17> with chord (5, 16)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, 3, 7, 12> with chord (3, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, 13, 10, 9, 18> with chord (9, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <6, 11, 0, 1, 7> with chord (1, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <16, 17, 4, 19, 6> with chord (4, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, we found 10 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the count is [10].
