Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 5, 2, 27, 1> of length 4
- Cycle <0, 5, 9, 3, 8> of length 4
- Cycle <0, 5, 9, 3, 10, 14, 12, 22, 26, 1> of length 10
- Cycle <0, 5, 28, 21, 26, 1> of length 5
- Cycle <0, 5, 28, 19, 24, 1> of length 6
- Cycle <0, 7, 29, 28, 5> of length 4
- Cycle <0, 7, 29, 28, 21, 26, 1> of length 7
- Cycle <0, 4, 20, 6, 24, 19, 28, 5> of length 8
- Cycle <0, 4, 20, 6, 23, 11, 22, 26, 1> of length 8
- Cycle <0, 10, 3, 9, 5, 28, 21, 26, 1> of length 8
- Cycle <0, 10, 3, 9, 5, 28, 19, 24, 1> of length 8
- Cycle <0, 10, 14, 12, 22, 26, 1> of length 6

- Cycle <1, 26, 21, 28, 5, 9, 3, 10, 14, 18, 12, 22, 25> of length 13

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 28, 21, 26, 1> has chord (26, 21)
- <0, 5, 28, 19, 24, 1> has chord (1, 24)
- <0, 4, 20, 6, 24, 19, 28, 5> has chord (20, 6)
- <0, 4, 20, 6, 23, 11, 22, 26, 1> has chord (6, 20)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 5, 28, 21, 26, 1>
- <0, 5, 28, 19, 24, 1>
- <0, 4, 20, 6, 24, 19, 28, 5>
- <0, 4, 20, 6, 23, 11, 22, 26, 1>
