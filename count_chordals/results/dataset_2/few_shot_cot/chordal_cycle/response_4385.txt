Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 1 - 3 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 4 - 7 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 3: 6 - 0 - 7 - 4 - 6
- Cycle 4: 6 - 5 - 7 - 0 - 6
- Cycle 5: 9 - 1 - 2 - 4 - 9
- Cycle 6: 9 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 9
- Cycle 7: 1 - 2 - 4 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 8: 3 - 5 - 7 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 9: 4 - 7 - 8 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 10: 0 - 7 - 8 - 6 - 0
- Cycle 11: 3 - 1 - 9 - 6 - 3
- Cycle 12: 2 - 4 - 6 - 8 - 2

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, only Cycle 6 (9 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 9) has exactly one chord (5 - 7) with two non-adjacent nodes in the cycle.

Step 3:
So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <<9, 3, 5, 7>> with chord <5, 7>.
