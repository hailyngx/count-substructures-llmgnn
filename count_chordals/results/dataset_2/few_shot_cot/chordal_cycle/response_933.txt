Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (0, 6, 5, 4, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 6, 7, 5, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 4, 5, 0)
- Cycle 4: (1, 4, 3, 7, 1)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (6, 4) - <1, (6, 4), 2, 5, 3>
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (6, 5) - <2, (6, 5), 1, 7, 3>
- Cycle 3 has no chords
- Cycle 4 has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found: <1, (6, 4), 2, 5, 3> and <2, (6, 5), 1, 7, 3>

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
