Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <3, 25, 21, 5> - (3, 25) is the chord
- <25, 1, 21, 5> - (1, 25) is the chord
- <25, 1, 21, 2> - (1, 25) is the chord
- <8, 23, 17, 6> - (23, 17) is the chord
- <8, 23, 24, 12> - (23, 24) is the chord
- <8, 9, 22, 19> - (9, 22) is the chord
- <8, 11, 26, 13> - (11, 26) is the chord
- <8, 11, 7, 19> - (11, 7) is the chord
- <18, 17, 3, 25> - (17, 3) is the chord
- <15, 8, 11, 26> - (8, 11) is the chord
- <4, 0, 5, 16> - (0, 5) is the chord
- <21, 3, 25, 1> - (3, 25) is the chord
- <28, 23, 24, 12> - (23, 24) is the chord
- <26, 14, 7, 19> - (14, 7) is the chord

Step 3:
There are 14 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
Therefore, the count of chordless 4-cycles in the given graph is [85].
