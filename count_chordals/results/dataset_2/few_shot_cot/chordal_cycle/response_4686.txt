Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is <0, 1, 3, 5> with non-adjacent chords (0, 3). 

Following the steps outlined before:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle: 0, 1, 3, 5
- Cycle: 1, 3, 7, 2
- Cycle: 3, 1, 6, 5
- Cycle: 5, 0, 4, 10
- Cycle: 6, 1, 3, 5
- Cycle: 7, 3, 10, 2
- Cycle: 8, 7, 3, 10
- Cycle: 9, 14, 8, 7
- Cycle: 10, 3, 1, 6
- Cycle: 11, 1, 3, 5
- Cycle: 12, 14, 9, 13
- Cycle: 13, 0, 4, 6
- Cycle: 14, 9, 13, 7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle 0, 1, 3, 5 has the non-adjacent chords (0, 3).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 0 chordless cycle found.

So the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
