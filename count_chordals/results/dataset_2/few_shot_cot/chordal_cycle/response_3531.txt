From the cycles listed above, we can identify the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 16, 4, 27> (Chord: 16-4)
- <0, 1, 26, 18> (Chord: 1-26)
- <2, 7, 24, 3> (Chord: 7-24)
- <5, 17, 1, 26> (Chord: 17-1)
- <6, 8, 25, 27> (Chord: 8-27)
- <10, 5, 27, 4> (Chord: 5-27)
- <12, 5, 17, 1> (Chord: 5-17)
- <18, 22, 11, 7> (Chord: 22-11)
- <23, 18, 22, 15> (Chord: 18-22)
