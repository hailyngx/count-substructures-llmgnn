Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (3, 8) (3, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 1) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 4) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 5, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 5, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- We identify all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
    - Node 0 -> Node 4 -> Node 6 -> Node 5 -> Node 0 is a cycle.
        - <1> (0, 5, 2, 4) 
    - Node 1 -> Node 4 -> Node 6 -> Node 5 -> Node 1 is a cycle.
        - <2> (1, 4, 6, 5) 
    - Node 2 -> Node 5 -> Node 1 -> Node 4 -> Node 2 is a cycle.
        - <3> (2, 5, 1, 4) 
    - Node 3 -> Node 8 -> Node 2 -> Node 5 -> Node 3 is a cycle.
        - <4> (3, 8, 2, 5) 
    - Node 4 -> Node 1 -> Node 8 -> Node 3 -> Node 4 is a cycle.
        - <5> (4, 1, 8, 3) 
    - Node 5 -> Node 1 -> Node 8 -> Node 3 -> Node 5 is a cycle.
        - <6> (5, 1, 8, 3) 

Step 2:
- We check each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - Only cycle <1> (0, 5, 2, 4) has a single chord: (0, 2)

Step 3:
- Number of chordless cycles found: [5]
