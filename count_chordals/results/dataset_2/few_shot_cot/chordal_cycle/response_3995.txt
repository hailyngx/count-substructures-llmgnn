Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: {5, 1, 3, 6, 5}
- Cycle 2: {5, 1, 8, 7, 5}
- Cycle 3: {5, 1, 9, 4, 5}
- Cycle 4: {5, 3, 6, 4, 5}
- Cycle 5: {5, 8, 7, 2, 5}
- Cycle 6: {1, 3, 2, 5, 1}
- Cycle 7: {1, 8, 5, 2, 1}
- Cycle 8: {1, 9, 6, 3, 1}
- Cycle 9: {3, 6, 4, 9, 3}
- Cycle 10: {3, 1, 5, 2, 3}
- Cycle 11: {3, 7, 8, 2, 3}
- Cycle 12: {4, 9, 6, 3, 4}
- Cycle 13: {8, 7, 2, 5, 8}

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:
- <1, (3, 6), 5>
- <1, (1, 8), 5>
- <1, (1, 9), 5>
- <1, (6, 4), 5>
- <1, (8, 7), 5>
- <3, (5, 2), 1>
- <3, (3, 7), 1>
- <4, (4, 9), 5>
- <5, (8, 7), 2>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
