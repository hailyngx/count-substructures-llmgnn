Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <5, 1, 4, 7, 5>
2. <5, 1, 7, 4, 5>
3. <5, 1, 7, 8, 5>
4. <5, 1, 7, 3, 5>
5. <5, 1, 7, 6, 5>
6. <5, 2, 6, 7, 5>
7. <5, 2, 6, 3, 5>
8. <5, 2, 6, 9, 5>
9. <5, 2, 6, 7, 5>
10. <5, 3, 6, 7, 5>
11. <5, 3, 7, 4, 5>
12. <5, 3, 7, 6, 5>
13. <5, 7, 1, 4, 5>
14. <5, 7, 1, 3, 5>
15. <5, 7, 1, 5, 8>
16. <5, 7, 1, 5, 3>
17. <5, 7, 4, 9, 5>
18. <5, 7, 4, 1, 5>
19. <5, 7, 4, 8, 5>
20. <5, 7, 4, 9, 5>
21. <5, 7, 6, 2, 5>
22. <5, 7, 6, 3, 5>
23. <5, 7, 6, 9, 5>
24. <5, 7, 6, 2, 5>
25. <5, 8, 4, 7, 5>
26. <5, 8, 4, 1, 5>
27. <5, 8, 4, 9, 5>
28. <5, 8, 7, 2, 5>
29. <5, 8, 7, 3, 5>
30. <5, 8, 7, 4, 5>
31. <5, 9, 6, 2, 5>
32. <5, 9, 6, 3, 5>
33. <5, 9, 6, 7, 5>
34. <5, 9, 4, 7, 5>
35. <5, 9, 4, 1, 5>
36. <5, 9, 4, 8, 5>

Step 2:  
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <5, 1, 4, 7, 5> (chord: (1, 4))
2. <5, 1, 7, 4, 5> (chord: (1, 4))
3. <5, 1, 7, 8, 5> (chord: (1, 8))
4. <5, 1, 7, 3, 5> (chord: (1, 3))
5. <5, 1, 7, 6, 5> (chord: (1, 6))
6. <5, 2, 6, 7, 5> (chord: (2, 6))
7. <5, 2, 6, 3, 5> (chord: (2, 3))
8. <5, 3, 6, 7, 5> (chord: (3, 6))
9. <5, 3, 7, 4, 5> (chord: (3, 4))
10. <5, 7, 1, 4, 5> (chord: (1, 4))
11. <5, 7, 1, 3, 5> (chord: (1, 3))
12. <5, 7, 4, 9, 5> (chord: (4, 9))
13. <5, 7, 6, 2, 5> (chord: (6, 2))
14. <5, 8, 4, 7, 5> (chord: (4, 7))
15. <5, 9, 4, 7, 5> (chord: (4, 7))

Step 3:  
There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [15].
