Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
1. Cycle <0, 1, 4, 3>
2. Cycle <0, 2, 8, 5>
3. Cycle <0, 12, 14, 2>
4. Cycle <1, 4, 13, 3>
5. Cycle <2, 7, 11, 1>
6. Cycle <2, 7, 5, 8>
7. Cycle <2, 8, 4, 13>
8. Cycle <3, 9, 6, 13>
9. Cycle <3, 12, 7, 11>
10. Cycle <4, 13, 6, 9>
11. Cycle <7, 11, 1, 0>
12. Cycle <8, 5, 7, 12>
13. Cycle <9, 12, 14, 8>
14. Cycle <10, 12, 7, 11>
15. Cycle <10, 14, 9, 6>
16. Cycle <12, 7, 5, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
1. Cycle <0, 1, 4, 3> has a chord (1, 3)
2. Cycle <0, 2, 8, 5> has a chord (2, 5)
3. Cycle <1, 4, 13, 3> has a chord (4, 13)
4. Cycle <2, 7, 11, 1> has a chord (7, 11)
5. Cycle <2, 8, 4, 13> has a chord (4, 13)
6. Cycle <3, 9, 6, 13> has a chord (9, 13)
7. Cycle <4, 13, 6, 9> has a chord (6, 9)
8. Cycle <10, 12, 7, 11> has a chord (7, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 2, 8, 5>
<2, 7, 11, 1>
<3, 9, 6, 13>
<10, 12, 7, 11>
