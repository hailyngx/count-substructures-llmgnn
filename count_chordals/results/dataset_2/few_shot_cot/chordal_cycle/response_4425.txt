Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 1, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 9, 4, 11, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 8, 0, 12, 2>
- Cycle 4: <3, 5, 8, 0, 3>
- Cycle 5: <4, 9, 14, 6, 4>
- Cycle 6: <5, 8, 6, 7, 5>
- Cycle 7: <6, 11, 1, 9, 6>
- Cycle 8: <7, 5, 3, 13, 7>
- Cycle 9: <8, 2, 4, 11, 8>
- Cycle 10: <9, 1, 0, 12, 9>
- Cycle 11: <10, 1, 11, 4, 10>
- Cycle 12: <12, 0, 11, 6, 12>
- Cycle 13: <13, 10, 14, 9, 13>
- Cycle 14: <14, 7, 0, 12, 14>
  
Step 2: Checking for chord in each cycle:
- The cycles with a chord are:
  - Cycle 1: <0, 11, 1, 8, 0> (Chord: (1, 8))
  - Cycle 2: <1, 9, 4, 11, 1> (Chord: (4, 11))
  - Cycle 8: <8, 2, 4, 11, 8> (Chord: (4, 11))
  - Cycle 9: <9, 1, 0, 12, 9> (Chord: (0, 12))

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles: [10]
