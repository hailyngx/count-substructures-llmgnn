Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 0-7-9-1-0
- Cycle 0-7-9-12-0
- Cycle 0-7-5-14-9-0
- Cycle 0-7-2-8-9-0
- Cycle 0-12-9-14-5-0
- Cycle 0-12-11-4-14-9-0
- Cycle 1-9-14-4-11-3-5-1
- Cycle 1-4-11-3-5-0-7-9-1
- Cycle 1-4-14-5-0-7-9-12-1
- Cycle 2-6-7-9-1-12-11-4-2
- Cycle 2-7-9-12-11-4-14-5-2
- Cycle 2-10-8-6-7-9-12-11-2
- Cycle 2-10-8-9-12-11-4-14-2
- Cycle 2-4-11-3-5-14-9-1-2

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- The cycle <0, 7, 2, 8, 9, 0> has a chord (8, 1).
- The cycle <1, 9, 14, 4, 11, 3, 5, 1> has a chord (14, 4).
- The cycle <2, 6, 7, 9, 12, 11, 4, 2> has a chord (11, 3).
- The cycle <2, 10, 8, 9, 12, 11, 4, 14, 2> has a chord (9, 1).
- The cycle <2, 4, 11, 3, 5, 14, 9, 1, 2> has a chord (4, 1).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 0 unique chordal 4-cycle found without any chords.
Therefore, the final count is [0].
