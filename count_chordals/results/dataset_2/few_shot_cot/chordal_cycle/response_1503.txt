Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <6, 5, 8, 6>
- <6, 7, 8, 6>
- <6, 4, 2, 6>
- <9, 11, 0, 9>
- <1, 3, 4, 1>
- <1, 7, 3, 1>
- <11, 3, 0, 11>
- <3, 14, 4, 3>
- <5, 8, 6, 5>
- <11, 0, 9, 11>
- <13, 0, 9, 13>
- <7, 8, 6, 7>
- <14, 1, 7, 14>
- <8, 10, 5, 8>
- <12, 10, 5, 12>
- <2, 4, 6, 2>
- <4, 3, 1, 4>
- <0, 9, 11, 0>
- <0, 13, 11, 0>
- <12, 8, 6, 12>
- <10, 5, 8, 10>
- <12, 0, 9, 12>
- <4, 14, 3, 4>

Step 2: Cycles with exactly one chord:
- <6, 5, 8, 6>, Chord: (6, 8)
- <6, 7, 8, 6>, Chord: (7, 8)

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles = [21]
