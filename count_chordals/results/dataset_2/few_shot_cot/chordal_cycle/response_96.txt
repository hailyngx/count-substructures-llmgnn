Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph, so no possible chordal 4-cycles can be formed.

Step 2: 
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3:
- Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
