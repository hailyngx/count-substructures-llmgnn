- <3, 13, 11, 12>
- <3, 13, 8, 4>
- <3, 13, 14, 3>
- <4, 8, 13, 3>
- <4, 8, 12, 3>

Step 2: Checking for one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 9, 6, 2>   (Chord: (9, 6))
- <0, 9, 11, 13>   (Chord: (9, 11))
- <0, 9, 11, 12>   No chord
- <1, 7, 10, 11>   No chord
- <1, 7, 3, 13>   (Chord: (7, 13))
- <1, 7, 5, 3>   (Chord: (7, 3))
- <2, 6, 9, 11>   (Chord: (6, 11))
- <2, 6, 7, 5>   (Chord: (6, 7))
- <2, 11, 13, 14>   (Chord: (11, 14))
- <3, 13, 11, 12>   (Chord: (13, 12))
- <3, 13, 8, 4>   (Chord: (13, 8))
- <3, 13, 14, 3>   (Chord: (13, 14))
- <4, 8, 13, 3>   (Chord: (8, 3))
- <4, 8, 12, 3>   (Chord: (8, 12))
- <5, 7, 10, 11>   (Chord: (7, 10))
- <5, 7, 3, 13>   (Chord: (7, 13))
- <5, 7, 6, 9>   (Chord: (7, 6))
- <6, 7, 3, 13>   (Chord: (7, 13))
- <6, 7, 5, 0>   (Chord: (7, 5))
- <8, 9, 6, 2>   (Chord: (9, 6))
- <8, 9, 11, 13>   (Chord: (9, 11))
- <8, 11, 12, 3>   (Chord: (11, 12))
- <9, 6, 7, 5>   (Chord: (6, 7))
- <9, 11, 13, 14>   (Chord: (11, 14))
- <10, 7, 3, 13>   (Chord: (7, 13))
- <11, 13, 14, 3>   (Chord: (13, 14))
- <12, 11, 13, 3>   (Chord: (11, 13))
