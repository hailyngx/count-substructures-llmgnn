Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 10, 12, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 14, 6, 5, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 3, 14, 13, 2>
- Cycle 4: <4, 6, 5, 7, 9, 6>
- Cycle 5: <4, 6, 9, 7, 5, 4>
- Cycle 6: <4, 8, 13, 3, 2, 4>
- Cycle 7: <4, 8, 6, 5, 12, 4>
- Cycle 8: <4, 8, 13, 14, 6, 4>
- Cycle 9: <5, 3, 14, 6, 9, 5>
- Cycle 10: <5, 6, 4, 8, 13, 5>
- Cycle 11: <7, 9, 6, 5, 12, 7>
- Cycle 12: <10, 9, 6, 14, 12, 10>
- Cycle 13: <11, 6, 5, 7, 9, 11>
- Cycle 14: <12, 10, 9, 8, 6, 12>
- Cycle 15: <12, 10, 11, 6, 14, 12>
- Cycle 16: <12, 14, 6, 9, 7, 12>
- Cycle 17: <13, 14, 6, 5, 12, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 6, 9, 7, 5> with chord (6, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 17 cycles, and 1 of them is a chordal 4-cycle, so the number of chordless cycles is 17 - 1 = 16.

Putting this final number inside brackets gives [16].
