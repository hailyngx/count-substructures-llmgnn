Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (14, 16, 20, 15) - Cycle of length 4
- (14, 16, 20, 6) - Cycle of length 4
- (14, 9, 22, 17) - Cycle of length 4
- (14, 9, 29, 1) - Cycle of length 4
- (16, 20, 8, 22) - Cycle of length 4
- (16, 20, 15, 18) - Cycle of length 4
- (16, 20, 6, 9) - Cycle of length 4
- (16, 11, 12, 10) - Cycle of length 4
- (20, 15, 18, 19) - Cycle of length 4
- (20, 15, 28, 25) - Cycle of length 4
- (20, 6, 25, 7) - Cycle of length 4
- (20, 6, 23, 5) - Cycle of length 4
- (29, 9, 22, 17) - Cycle of length 4
- (29, 9, 6, 23) - Cycle of length 4
- (29, 9, 14, 16) - Cycle of length 4
- (29, 10, 2, 22) - Cycle of length 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <14, 16, (6, 20), 15> - Chord (6, 20) added between 14 and 15
- <14, (9, 22), 17, 16> - Chord (9, 22) added between 14 and 17
- <14, 9, (29, 1), 22> - Chord (29, 1) added between 9 and 22
- <16, (8, 20), 15, 18> - Chord (8, 20) added between 16 and 15
- <16, (6, 20), 9, 14> - Chord (6, 20) added between 16 and 9
- <16, 11, 12, (10, 29)> - Chord (10, 29) added between 11 and 12
- <20, (8, 15), 18, 19> - Chord (8, 15) added between 20 and 18
- <20, (15, 28), 25, 7> - Chord (15, 28) added between 20 and 7
- <20, (6, 25), 7, 21> - Chord (6, 25) added between 20 and 21
- <20, (6, 23), 5, 26> - Chord (6, 23) added between 20 and 5
- <29, 9, (22, 17), 14> - Chord (22, 17) added between 29 and 14
- <29, (10, 2), 22, 17> - Chord (10, 2) added between 29 and 22

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [12]
