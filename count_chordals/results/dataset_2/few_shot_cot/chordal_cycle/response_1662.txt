- <1, 7, (12, 13), 1>
- <1, 7, (12, 13), 11>
- <1, 7, (17, 13), 1>
- <1, 7, (17, 2), 1>
- <1, 7, (17, 13), 11>
- <1, 7, (19, 15), 1>
- <1, 14, (15, 19), 1>
- <1, 14, (16, 9), 1>
- <1, 14, (16, 2), 1>
- <2, 8, (13, 12), 2>
- <2, 8, (13, 11), 2>
- <2, 8, (13, 17), 2>

- <3, 4, (9, 11), 3>
- <4, 9, (5, 10), 4>
- <5, 9, (11, 13), 5>
