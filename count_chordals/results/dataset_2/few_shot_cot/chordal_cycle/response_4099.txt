- Cycle 120: <14, 6, 11, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 7, 1, 9> (Chord: (1, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 13, 9, 4> (Chord: (9, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 3, 6, 14> (Chord: (3, 14))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 3, 8, 5> (Chord: (3, 5))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 4, 13, 9> (Chord: (4, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, 6, 14, 10> (Chord: (6, 10))
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6, 4, 13, 0> (Chord: (4, 13))
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, 5, 10, 12> (Chord: (5, 12))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. As each of the 8 cycles listed in Step 2 is chordal, the number of chordless cycles is 0. Therefore, the final count is [0].
