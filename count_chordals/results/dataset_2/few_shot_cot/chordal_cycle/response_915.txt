Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 with all edges present:
- Cycle <5, 9, 0, 14, 5>
- Cycle <5, 2, 17, 11, 5>
- Cycle <5, 18, 12, 4, 5>
- Cycle <5, 13, 1, 11, 5>
- Cycle <3, 19, 8, 12, 3>
- Cycle <3, 6, 14, 7, 3>
- Cycle <3, 16, 10, 11, 3>
- Cycle <1, 11, 7, 14, 1>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle <5, 9, 0, 14, 5> has a chord: (0, 9)
- Cycle <5, 2, 17, 11, 5> has a chord: (2, 17)
- Cycle <5, 18, 12, 4, 5> has a chord: (12, 18)
- Cycle <5, 13, 1, 11, 5> has a chord: (1, 11)
- Cycle <3, 19, 8, 12, 3> has a chord: (8, 19)
- Cycle <3, 6, 14, 7, 3> has a chord: (6, 14)
- Cycle <3, 16, 10, 11, 3> has a chord: (10, 11)
- Cycle <1, 11, 7, 14, 1> has a chord: (7, 14)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
