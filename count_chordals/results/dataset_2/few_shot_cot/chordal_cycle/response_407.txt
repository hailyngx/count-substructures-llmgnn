Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 6, 9, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 2, 4, 9>
- Cycle 3: <1, 2, 4, 9, 8>
- Cycle 4: <3, 2, 1, 6, 7>
- Cycle 5: <5, 7, 6, 1, 0>
- Cycle 6: <5, 2, 4, 9, 8>
- Cycle 7: <5, 8, 6, 1, 0>
- Cycle 8: <6, 1, 2, 4, 9>
- Cycle 9: <6, 1, 7, 3, 2>
- Cycle 10: <6, 3, 7, 5, 8>
- Cycle 11: <6, 8, 9, 4, 2>
- Cycle 12: <7, 6, 1, 2, 4>
  
Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (2, 9)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (2, 6)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (2, 9)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (1, 2)
  
Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
- There are 8 chordless cycles found.
- So, the final answer is [8].
