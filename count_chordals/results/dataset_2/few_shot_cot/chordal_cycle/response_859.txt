Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <5, (18, 25), 16>. 

To count the number of chordless cycles, we can use the steps provided:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- There are several cycles in the graph, such as (1, 3, 15, 1), (4, 11, 26, 22, 4), (7, 24, 5, 8, 7), (10, 18, 25, 16, 10), (13, 23, 4, 11, 13), (16, 25, 10, 18, 16), (18, 25, 17, 26, 18), and so on.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- By examining the cycles listed above, we find that the cycle (5, 18, 25, 16, 5) has exactly one chord, which is the edge connecting nodes 18 and 25.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Since we found one unique chordal 4-cycle, the number of chordless cycles is [7].
