Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 21, 16, 5> has exactly one chord 5-22
- <1, 21, 17, 29> has exactly one chord 17-6
- <1, 24, 9, 4> has exactly one chord 9-2
- <1, 18, 0, 8> has exactly one chord 0-14
- <21, 17, 29, 26> has exactly one chord 17-6

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
- <1, 21, 16, 5> with chord 5-22
- <1, 21, 17, 29> with chord 17-6
- <1, 24, 9, 4> with chord 9-2
- <1, 18, 0, 8> with chord 0-14
- <21, 17, 29, 26> with chord 17-6
