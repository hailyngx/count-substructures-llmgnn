Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 17, 19>
- Cycle 2: <0, 10, 13, 17>
- Cycle 3: <0, 18, 9, 3>
- Cycle 4: <1, 12, 7, 16>
- Cycle 5: <1, 12, 10, 13>
- Cycle 6: <1, 12, 16, 2>
- Cycle 7: <1, 15, 6, 14>
- Cycle 8: <2, 3, 11, 6>
- Cycle 9: <2, 5, 14, 6>
- Cycle 10: <3, 11, 6, 15>
- Cycle 11: <4, 8, 19, 5>
- Cycle 12: <5, 13, 17, 4>
- Cycle 13: <5, 13, 10, 12>
- Cycle 14: <5, 19, 6, 14>
- Cycle 15: <6, 11, 3, 9>
- Cycle 16: <7, 12, 10, 0>
- Cycle 17: <7, 16, 2, 5>
- Cycle 18: <9, 3, 2, 16>
- Cycle 19: <9, 18, 0, 4>
- Cycle 20: <16, 7, 12, 1>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 4, 17, 19> (Chord: (4, 17))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 0 chordless cycle.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
