Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (8, 21, 20, 13, 8)
- Cycle 2: (2, 5, 28, 6, 2)
- Cycle 3: (9, 10, 27, 25, 18, 8, 13, 9)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 28, 18, 25, 20, 13, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 5: (17, 3, 16, 26, 27, 25, 20, 12, 17)
- Cycle 6: (24, 0, 8, 13, 20, 12, 24)
- Cycle 7: (22, 4, 22)
- Cycle 8: (19, 27, 25, 20, 12, 17, 19)
- Cycle 9: (8, 13, 20, 12, 17, 3, 9, 10, 22, 8)
- Cycle 10: (24, 12, 17, 3, 9, 10, 22, 4, 22, 24)
- Cycle 11: (28, 18, 25, 20, 12, 17, 3, 9, 10, 27, 26, 28)
- Cycle 12: (28, 18, 25, 20, 12, 17, 3, 9, 10, 22, 4, 22, 2, 5, 28)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (20, 13)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (5, 28)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (6, 28)
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord: (27, 25)
- Cycle 9 has exactly one chord: (13, 20)
- Cycle 11 has exactly one chord: (27, 26)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 7 chordless cycles found, so the final answer is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <8, (20, 13), 21>
2. <2, (5, 28), 6>
3. <6, (6, 28), 1>
4. <8, (27, 25), 13>
5. <8, (13, 20), 12>
6. <8, (27, 26), 13>
7. <24, (0, 24), 21>
