Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more: 
- <1, 4, 10, 5>
- <1, 4, 3, 11>
- <1, 4, 3, 14>
- <1, 4, 7, 6>
- <1, 3, 11, 14>
- <1, 3, 14, 13>
- <1, 5, 10, 13>
- <1, 5, 8, 12>
- <1, 13, 2, 9>
- <3, 4, 7, 6>
- <3, 4, 10, 13>
- <3, 4, 9, 12>
- <3, 11, 14, 13>
- <4, 7, 6, 3>
- <4, 7, 9, 10>
- <8, 5, 10, 13>
- <8, 5, 1, 4>
- <8, 12, 9, 4>
- <9, 4, 1, 3>
- <9, 4, 7, 6>
- <10, 13, 7, 6>

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord: 
- <1, 4, 10, 5> -> Chord: (4, 10)
- <1, 4, 7, 6> -> Chord: (4, 7)
- <1, 3, 11, 14> -> Chord: (3, 11)
- <1, 5, 10, 13> -> Chord: (5, 10)
- <1, 13, 2, 9> -> Chord: (2, 9)
- <3, 4, 7, 6> -> Chord: (4, 7)
- <3, 4, 10, 13> -> Chord: (4, 10)
- <3, 11, 14, 13> -> Chord: (11, 14)
- <4, 7, 6, 3> -> Chord: (7, 6)
- <4, 7, 9, 10> -> Chord: (7, 9)
- <8, 5, 10, 13> -> Chord: (5, 10)
- <8, 12, 9, 4> -> Chord: (9, 12)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]
