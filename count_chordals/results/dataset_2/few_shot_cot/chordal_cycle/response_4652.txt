Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:  
- <0, 1, 6, 16>  
- <0, 1, 6, 9>  
- <0, 12, 7, 3>  
- <0, 12, 7, 19>  
- <1, 6, 16, 11>  
- <1, 6, 16, 15>  
- <2, 11, 16, 6>  
- <2, 11, 16, 15>  
- <3, 7, 12, 0>  
- <3, 7, 12, 16>  
- <3, 7, 19, 11>  
- <4, 10, 7, 19>  
- <4, 10, 5, 13>  
- <4, 10, 5, 15>  
- <4, 13, 5, 9>  
- <4, 13, 5, 15>  
- <4, 13, 15, 16>  
- <4, 14, 9, 5>  
- <5, 9, 6, 1>  
- <5, 9, 6, 16>  
- <5, 9, 14, 4>  
- <5, 15, 13, 4>  
- <5, 15, 13, 4>  
- <6, 9, 5, 13>  
- <6, 9, 5, 15>  
- <6, 16, 11, 3>  
- <7, 10, 5, 9>  
- <7, 10, 5, 15>  
- <7, 12, 0, 1>  
- <7, 12, 16, 11>  
- <7, 12, 16, 15>  
- <7, 19, 11, 2>  
- <7, 19, 11, 16>  
- <7, 19, 11, 2>  
- <7, 19, 11, 16>  
- <7, 19, 18, 3>  
- <9, 5, 15, 13>  
- <9, 14, 4, 10>  
- <11, 16, 6, 9>  
- <11, 19, 7, 12>  
- <11, 19, 7, 3>  
- <12, 16, 6, 9>  
- <12, 16, 15, 5>  
- <13, 4, 10, 5>  
- <13, 4, 14, 9>  
- <15, 5, 9, 14>  

Step 2:  
Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:  
- <0, 1, 6, 16>  (Chord: 6-16)  
- <0, 12, 7, 3>  (Chord: 7-3)  
- <1, 6, 16, 11>  (Chord: 16-11)  
- <2, 11, 16, 6>  (Chord: 16-6)  
- <3, 7, 12, 0>  (Chord: 12-0)  
- <4, 13, 5, 9>  (Chord: 5-9)  
- <4, 13, 5, 15>  (Chord: 5-15)  
- <7, 10, 5, 9>  (Chord: 5-9)  
- <7, 12, 16, 11>  (Chord: 12-16)  
- <7, 19, 18, 3>  (Chord: 18-3)  
- <9, 5, 15, 13>  (Chord: 15-13)  

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have a total of [10].
