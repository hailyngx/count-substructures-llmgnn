Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 that can be found in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 5)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 3, 4)
- Cycle 3: (2, 5, 3, 2)
- Cycle 4: (6, 8, 0, 6)
- Cycle 5: (1, 9, 7, 4)
- Cycle 6: (0, 8, 4, 0)
- Cycle 7: (1, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 8: (2, 5, 9, 2)
- Cycle 9: (0, 8, 6, 0)
- Cycle 10: (3, 5, 9, 3)
- Cycle 11: (2, 5, 9, 2)
- Cycle 12: (1, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 13: (4, 7, 9, 4)
- Cycle 14: (5, 2, 4, 5)
- Cycle 15: (4, 7, 9, 4)
- Cycle 16: (7, 9, 1, 7)
- Cycle 17: (3, 5, 9, 3)
- Cycle 18: (3, 7, 4, 3)
- Cycle 19: (8, 4, 1, 8)
- Cycle 20: (0, 8, 4, 0)
- Cycle 21: (8, 4, 7, 8)
- Cycle 22: (3, 6, 2, 3)
- Cycle 23: (6, 8, 4, 6)
- Cycle 24: (9, 5, 3, 9)
- Cycle 25: (6, 8, 4, 6)
- Cycle 26: (2, 4, 7, 2)
- Cycle 27: (2, 0, 6, 2)
- Cycle 28: (4, 7, 3, 4)
- Cycle 29: (2, 0, 6, 2)
- Cycle 30: (2, 1, 9, 2)
- Cycle 31: (4, 7, 3, 4)
- Cycle 32: (0, 8, 4, 0)
- Cycle 33: (2, 5, 9, 2)
- Cycle 34: (1, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 35: (2, 6, 3, 2)
- Cycle 36: (0, 6, 3, 0)
- Cycle 37: (7, 9, 4, 7)
- Cycle 38: (2, 0, 8, 2)
- Cycle 39: (0, 6, 3, 0)

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are: 
- <1, (4, 7), 3>
- <2, (5, 9), 3>
- <4, (7, 9), 3>
- <6, (0, 8), 4>

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
