Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 7) (9, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 8, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 8, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 5, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<8, 9, 7, 4>
<8, 9, 7, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
<0, 2, 1, 5> - Chord: (1, 5)
<0, 2, 1, 4> - Chord: (1, 4)
<0, 2, 8, 6> - Chord: (8, 6)
<0, 2, 8, 9> - Chord: (8, 9)
<0, 8, 6, 7> - Chord: (6, 7)
<0, 3, 6, 7> - Chord: (6, 7)
<1, 4, 2, 5> - Chord: (2, 5)
<2, 4, 7, 6> - Chord: (7, 6)
<2, 8, 6, 7> - Chord: (6, 7)
<2, 5, 1, 6> - Chord: (1, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Putting this final number inside brackets gives us [10].
