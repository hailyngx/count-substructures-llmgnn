Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: <2, 29, 27, 4, 2>
- Cycle 2: <2, 19, 10, 7, 11, 28, 15, 25, 23, 3, 24, 5, 20, 23, 25, 15, 28, 11, 7, 10>
- Cycle 3: <2, 29, 27, 4, 26, 11, 10, 2>
- Cycle 4: <14, 17, 6, 1, 29, 27, 4, 26, 11, 10, 2, 19, 10, 7, 11, 28, 15, 25, 12, 13, 15, 28, 11, 26, 4, 2>
- Cycle 5: <14, 17, 6, 12, 13, 15, 28, 11, 26, 4, 2, 29, 27, 4, 26, 11, 28, 15, 25, 23, 3, 24, 5, 20, 23, 25, 16, 9, 17, 14, 0, 22, 9, 16, 25, 13, 12, 6>

Step 2: Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <2, 29, 27, 4, 2> has a chord (29, 4).
- <2, 19, 10, 7, 11, 28, 15, 25, 23, 3, 24, 5, 20, 23, 25, 15, 28, 11, 7, 10> has no chords.
- <2, 29, 27, 4, 26, 11, 10, 2> has a chord (4, 11).
- <14, 17, 6, 1, 29, 27, 4, 26, 11, 10, 2, 19, 10, 7, 11, 28, 15, 25, 12, 13, 15, 28, 11, 26, 4, 2> has a chord (11, 26).
- <14, 17, 6, 12, 13, 15, 28, 11, 26, 4, 2, 29, 27, 4, 26, 11, 28, 15, 25, 23, 3, 24, 5, 20, 23, 25, 16, 9, 17, 14, 0, 22, 9, 16, 25, 13, 12, 6> has a chord (26, 9).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
Since only <2, 29, 27, 4, 2> has exactly one chord, the final count is [1].
