Response:
In this graph, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <8, (6, 12), 15> with a chord connecting nodes 6 and 12.

Following the steps provided earlier:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (8, 10, 14, 11, 7, 15, 6, 8)
- Cycle 2: (8, 3, 5, 7, 11, 14, 13, 6, 8)
- Cycle 3: (8, 6, 15, 7, 5, 3, 8)
- Cycle 4: (8, 6, 13, 14, 11, 7, 15, 12, 1, 10, 8)
- Cycle 5: (6, 13, 14, 11, 7, 15, 12, 1, 2, 5, 3, 8)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: No chord
- Cycle 2: No chord
- Cycle 3: No chord
- Cycle 4: Two chords, so not a chordal cycle
- Cycle 5: No chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles = [1]
