Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 10) (6, 12) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 11) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 0) (10, 6) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 12) (11, 4) (11, 10) (11, 0) (11, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 5) (3, 9) (3, 10) (3, 5) (5, 13) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 14) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 12) (14, 5) (14, 1) (14, 12) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 12) (12, 6) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) (12, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 13, 10, 11, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 13, 14, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 10, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 0, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 13, 11, 2, 3, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 10, 12, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 1, 7, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 11, 0, 3, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 10, 0, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 9, 10, 0, 14, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 12

Response:
Following the steps provided, we will list all cycles of 4 nodes or more in the given graph where each edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle: <0, 4, 11, 5>
2. Cycle: <0, 10, 12, 6>
3. Cycle: <0, 13, 1, 9>
4. Cycle: <1, 12, 14, 5>
5. Cycle: <2, 5, 13, 1>
6. Cycle: <2, 7, 4, 6>
7. Cycle: <3, 10, 6, 9>
8. Cycle: <3, 5, 11, 4>
9. Cycle: <4, 6, 9, 12>
10. Cycle: <5, 11, 0, 10>
11. Cycle: <5, 14, 12, 1>
12. Cycle: <7, 9, 6, 4>

Now, we will check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chords:
- <0, 11> in cycle <0, 4, 11, 5>
- <6, 10> in cycle <0, 10, 12, 6>
- <1, 9> in cycle <0, 13, 1, 9>
- <12, 14> in cycle <1, 12, 14, 5>
- <13, 1> in cycle <2, 5, 13, 1>
- <4, 6> in cycle <2, 7, 4, 6>
- <6, 9> in cycle <3, 10, 6, 9>
- <4, 5> in cycle <3, 5, 11, 4>
- <4, 12> in cycle <4, 6, 9, 12>
- <0, 10> in cycle <5, 11, 0, 10>
- <1, 12> in cycle <5, 14, 12, 1>
- <6, 9> in cycle <7, 9, 6, 4>

With the chords listed, we can determine the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, we have 12 cycles and all of them have at least one chord. Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is given in brackets as [0].
