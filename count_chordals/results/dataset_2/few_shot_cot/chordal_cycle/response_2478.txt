Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 2, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
We can identify the cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 8, 4, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 3, 7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 6, 7, 3, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 4, 8, 1, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 4, 5, 1, 2)
- Cycle 6: (3, 4, 8, 5, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 7, 6, 2, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 5, 3, 4)
- Cycle 9: (5, 4, 3, 7, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 1, 8, 4, 5)
- Cycle 11: (6, 7, 3, 2, 6)
- Cycle 12: (6, 2, 4, 8, 6)
- Cycle 13: (7, 6, 2, 3, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 3, 5, 1, 7)
- Cycle 15: (8, 6, 7, 3, 8)
- Cycle 16: (9, 1, 8, 4, 9)
- Cycle 17: (9, 2, 6, 7, 9)
- Cycle 18: (9, 3, 5, 1, 9)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 5), 8>
- <1, (3, 7), 5>
- <2, (6, 7), 4>
- <2, (1, 8), 4>
- <2, (4, 5), 1>
- <3, (4, 8), 5>
- <3, (2, 7), 6>
- <4, (8, 5), 3>
- <5, (4, 3), 7>
- <5, (1, 8), 4>
- <6, (7, 3), 2>
- <6, (2, 8), 4>
- <7, (6, 3), 2>
- <7, (1, 5), 3>
- <8, (6, 3), 7>
- <9, (1, 4), 8>
- <9, (2, 7), 6>
- <9, (3, 5), 1>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0. 
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
