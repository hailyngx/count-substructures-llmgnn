Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is:

<0, (2, 11), 8, 6>

Following these steps:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists: 
- Cycle 1: 0 - 8 - 9 - 16 - 10 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 8 - 6 - 3 - 1 - 15 - 13 - 9 - 16 - 10 - 14 - 19 - 17 - 4 - 19 - 9 - 8
- Cycle 3: 0 - 8 - 6 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 18 - 11 - 12 - 14 - 10 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 11 - 12 - 14 - 19 - 17 - 11 - 0
- Cycle 5: 0 - 11 - 18 - 7 - 5 - 3 - 6 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 6: 2 - 10 - 16 - 9 - 13 - 15 - 1 - 3 - 6 - 8 - 0 - 2
- Cycle 7: 2 - 11 - 17 - 4 - 19 - 14 - 12 - 11 - 18 - 2
- Cycle 8: 4 - 17 - 19 - 14 - 10 - 2 - 18 - 7 - 5 - 3 - 6 - 8 - 0 - 11 - 12 - 14 - 19 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord: 
- Only Cycle 3 (0 - 8 - 6 - 3 - 5 - 7 - 18 - 11 - 12 - 14 - 10 - 2 - 0) contains exactly one chord (11, 2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph, so the final answer is [1].
