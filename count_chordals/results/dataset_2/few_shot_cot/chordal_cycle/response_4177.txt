Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <5, 7, 4, 6>
- Cycle 2: <5, 7, 0, 3>
- Cycle 3: <5, 7, 6, 4>
- Cycle 4: <5, 7, 8, 1>
- Cycle 5: <5, 7, 6, 3>
- Cycle 6: <5, 7, 8, 0>
- Cycle 7: <5, 1, 4, 6>
- Cycle 8: <5, 1, 8, 6>
- Cycle 9: <5, 1, 8, 7>
- Cycle 10: <5, 1, 4, 7>
- Cycle 11: <5, 1, 8, 0>
- Cycle 12: <5, 9, 2, 5>
- Cycle 13: <5, 9, 3, 0>
- Cycle 14: <5, 9, 7, 4>
- Cycle 15: <5, 9, 2, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (7, 0)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (7, 6)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (7, 3)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (1, 4)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (5, 2)
- Cycle 13 has one chord: (5, 3)
- Cycle 14 has one chord: (5, 7)
- Cycle 15 has one chord: (5, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
