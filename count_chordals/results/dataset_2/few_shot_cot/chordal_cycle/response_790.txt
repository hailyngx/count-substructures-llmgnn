Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:

The cycles in the graph are: 
<0, 10, 9, 5, 15> (length 4) 
<0, 10, 9, 18, 2, 3, 1, 12> (length 7) 
<1, 3, 2, 18, 9, 5, 14> (length 6)
<1, 3, 16, 4, 7, 6, 11> (length 6)
<1, 12, 3, 16, 4, 13, 18> (length 6)
<2, 3, 16, 4, 13, 18> (length 5)
<4, 7, 6, 11, 14, 5, 15> (length 6)
<4, 13, 18, 9, 5, 15> (length 5)
<5, 9, 18, 13, 4, 16, 3, 1> (length 7)
<6, 7, 4, 16, 3, 1, 12, 2> (length 7)
<6, 11, 3, 1, 12, 2, 17, 19> (length 7)
<9, 18, 13, 10, 0, 10> (length 5)
<10, 13, 18, 9, 5, 15> (length 5)

Step 2: Checking for a chord in each cycle:
<0, 10, 9, 5, 15> - has a chord: (10, 5)
<0, 10, 9, 18, 2, 3, 1, 12> - has a chord: (9, 3)
<1, 3, 2, 18, 9, 5, 14> - has a chord: (2, 14)
<1, 3, 16, 4, 7, 6, 11> - has a chord: (4, 11)
<1, 12, 3, 16, 4, 13, 18> - is chordless
<2, 3, 16, 4, 13, 18> - is chordless
<4, 7, 6, 11, 14, 5, 15> - has a chord: (6, 14)
<4, 13, 18, 9, 5, 15> - is chordless
<5, 9, 18, 13, 4, 16, 3, 1> - has a chord: (9, 4)
<6, 7, 4, 16, 3, 1, 12, 2> - has a chord: (7, 12)
<6, 11, 3, 1, 12, 2, 17, 19> - has a chord: (3, 17)
<9, 18, 13, 10, 0, 10> - is chordless
<10, 13, 18, 9, 5, 15> - is chordless

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are [7] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 10, 9, 5, 15>, chord: (10, 5)
<0, 10, 9, 18, 2, 3, 1, 12>, chord: (9, 3)
<1, 3, 2, 18, 9, 5, 14>, chord: (2, 14)
<1, 3, 16, 4, 7, 6, 11>, chord: (4, 11)
<4, 7, 6, 11, 14, 5, 15>, chord: (6, 14)
<5, 9, 18, 13, 4, 16, 3, 1>, chord: (9, 4)
<6, 7, 4, 16, 3, 1, 12, 2>, chord: (7, 12)
<6, 11, 3, 1, 12, 2, 17, 19>, chord: (3, 17)
