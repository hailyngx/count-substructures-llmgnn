Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <0, 7, 5, 1>
2. <0, 7, 4, 3>
3. <0, 7, 5, 6>
4. <0, 9, 6, 5>
5. <1, 7, 4, 8>
6. <1, 7, 0, 9>
7. <1, 7, 5, 6>
8. <1, 6, 5, 3>
9. <2, 9, 4, 8>
10. <2, 9, 4, 3>
11. <3, 4, 7, 5>
12. <3, 4, 8, 0>
13. <4, 9, 6, 1>
14. <4, 9, 2, 3>
15. <4, 7, 0, 9>
16. <5, 7, 0, 9>
17. <5, 1, 6, 9>
18. <6, 9, 4, 7>
19. <6, 9, 2, 1>
20. <7, 0, 8, 4>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
<0, 7, 5, 1> with chord (0, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

The number of chordless cycles is [19].
