Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 16, 6, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 12, 7, 5, 3>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 12, 7, 5>
- Cycle 4: <2, 4, 12, 7, 5>
- Cycle 5: <2, 5, 3, 15, 10>
- Cycle 6: <2, 5, 11, 12, 7>
- Cycle 7: <4, 12, 18, 13, 8>
- Cycle 8: <6, 7, 12, 4, 2>
- Cycle 9: <6, 7, 12, 18, 13>
- Cycle 10: <9, 16, 8, 0, 12>
- Cycle 11: <9, 16, 14, 17, 10>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 8, 16, 6, 7> has no chord.
- <0, 12, 7, 5, 3> has a chord: (5, 7).
- <1, 4, 12, 7, 5> has a chord: (4, 7).
- <2, 4, 12, 7, 5> has a chord: (4, 7).
- <2, 5, 3, 15, 10> has a chord: (3, 10).
- <2, 5, 11, 12, 7> has a chord: (11, 12).
- <4, 12, 18, 13, 8> has no chord.
- <6, 7, 12, 4, 2> has a chord: (4, 12).
- <6, 7, 12, 18, 13> has a chord: (18, 12).
- <9, 16, 8, 0, 12> has no chord.
- <9, 16, 14, 17, 10> has no chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 4 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [4].
