Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: Listing cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 6, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 7, 2>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 5, 2>
- Cycle 5: <1, 3, 0, 4>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 9, 8>
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 5, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle 9: <2, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 10: <2, 1, 8, 9>
- Cycle 11: <3, 1, 8, 4>
- Cycle 12: <3, 1, 6, 5>
- Cycle 13: <4, 7, 2, 8>
- Cycle 14: <5, 6, 7, 2>
- Cycle 15: <8, 1, 6, 5>

Step 2: Checking for chorded cycles:
- Checking Cycle 1: <0, 4, 6, 7> has a chord (4, 7)
- Checking Cycle 2: <0, 4, 8, 1> has a chord (4, 8)
- Checking Cycle 3: <0, 4, 7, 2> has a chord (4, 7)
- Checking Cycle 4: <0, 6, 5, 2> is chordless
- Checking Cycle 5: <1, 3, 0, 4> is chordless
- Checking Cycle 6: <1, 3, 9, 8> is chordless
- Checking Cycle 7: <1, 6, 5, 2> has a chord (1, 5)
- Checking Cycle 8: <2, 7, 4, 8> has a chord (4, 8)
- Checking Cycle 9: <2, 7, 6, 5> is chordless
- Checking Cycle 10: <2, 1, 8, 9> is chordless
- Checking Cycle 11: <3, 1, 8, 4> is chordless
- Checking Cycle 12: <3, 1, 6, 5> is chordless
- Checking Cycle 13: <4, 7, 2, 8> has a chord (7, 8)
- Checking Cycle 14: <5, 6, 7, 2> is chordless
- Checking Cycle 15: <8, 1, 6, 5> is chordless

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
- <0, 6, 5, 2> 
- <1, 3, 0, 4>
- <1, 3, 9, 8>
- <2, 7, 6, 5>
- <2, 1, 8, 9>
- <3, 1, 8, 4>
