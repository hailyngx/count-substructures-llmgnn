Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 6, 8, 3> has a chord (6, 3).
- The cycle <0, 6, 8, 17> has a chord (6, 17).
- The cycle <0, 6, 8, 17, 4> has a chord (8, 4).
- The cycle <1, 9, 3, 13> has a chord (9, 13).
- The cycle <1, 15, 12, 5> has a chord (15, 5).
- The cycle <1, 15, 12, 5, 10> has a chord (12, 10).
- The cycle <1, 13, 3, 8> has a chord (13, 8).
- The cycle <1, 15, 12, 5, 13> has a chord (12, 13).
- The cycle <1, 13, 3, 8, 17> has a chord (8, 17).
- The cycle <1, 13, 3, 8, 17, 4> has a chord (3, 4).
- The cycle <1, 13, 0, 6> has a chord (0, 6).
- The cycle <1, 13, 0, 10> has a chord (13, 10).
- The cycle <1, 13, 14, 16> has a chord (13, 16).
- The cycle <3, 1, 15, 12> has a chord (1, 12).
- The cycle <3, 8, 6, 5> has a chord (8, 5).
- The cycle <3, 19, 10, 15> has a chord (19, 15).
- The cycle <5, 13, 14, 16> has a chord (13, 16).
- The cycle <6, 8, 3, 1> has a chord (8, 1).
- The cycle <6, 0, 13, 3> has a chord (0, 3).
- The cycle <10, 5, 6, 8> has a chord (5, 8).
- The cycle <11, 18, 16, 14> has a chord (18, 14).
- The cycle <16, 18, 11, 2> has a chord (18, 2).

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [19].
