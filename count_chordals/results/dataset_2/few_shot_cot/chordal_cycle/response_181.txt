Response:
Step 1: 
We can list the cycles of length 4 in the graph by checking all possible combinations of 4 nodes:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 9, 1, 4) with edges (4, 7), (7, 9), (9, 1), (1, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 6, 9, 4) with edges (4, 7), (7, 6), (6, 9), (9, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 8, 7, 6, 4) with edges (4, 8), (8, 7), (7, 6), (6, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 1, 3, 6, 4) with edges (4, 1), (1, 3), (3, 6), (6, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 9, 2, 6, 7) with edges (7, 9), (9, 2), (2, 6), (6, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 4, 1, 9, 7) with edges (7, 4), (4, 1), (1, 9), (9, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 6, 2, 9, 7) with edges (7, 6), (6, 2), (2, 9), (9, 7)
- Cycle 8: (7, 8, 5, 2, 7) with edges (7, 8), (8, 5), (5, 2), (2, 7)
- Cycle 9: (6, 9, 1, 3, 6) with edges (6, 9), (9, 1), (1, 3), (3, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 7, 4, 8, 6) with edges (6, 7), (7, 4), (4, 8), (8, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 3, 1, 0, 6) with edges (6, 3), (3, 1), (1, 0), (0, 6)
- Cycle 12: (9, 7, 4, 1, 9) with edges (9, 7), (7, 4), (4, 1), (1, 9)
- Cycle 13: (9, 6, 2, 5, 9) with edges (9, 6), (6, 2), (2, 5), (5, 9)
- Cycle 14: (9, 2, 5, 0, 9) with edges (9, 2), (2, 5), (5, 0), (0, 9)
- Cycle 15: (1, 4, 3, 9, 1) with edges (1, 4), (4, 3), (3, 9), (9, 1)
- Cycle 16: (3, 6, 7, 4, 3) with edges (3, 6), (6, 7), (7, 4), (4, 3)
- Cycle 17: (8, 4, 7, 6, 8) with edges (8, 4), (4, 7), (7, 6), (6, 8)
- Cycle 18: (8, 5, 2, 4, 8) with edges (8, 5), (5, 2), (2, 4), (4, 8)
- Cycle 19: (2, 6, 7, 8, 2) with edges (2, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 2)
- Cycle 20: (5, 8, 7, 4, 5) with edges (5, 8), (8, 7), (7, 4), (4, 5)
- Cycle 21: (0, 6, 7, 9, 0) with edges (0, 6), (6, 7), (7, 9), (9, 0)

Step 2:
Now, we check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: <1, 9>
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: <7, 6>
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: <7, 6>
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: <9, 1>
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord: <7, 9>
- Cycle 9 has exactly one chord: <6, 1>
- Cycle 10 has exactly one chord: <7, 4>
- Cycle 12 has exactly one chord: <7, 9>
- Cycle 15 has exactly one chord: <4, 9>
- Cycle 16 has exactly one chord: <6, 4>
- Cycle 17 has exactly one chord: <7, 6>
- Cycle 18 has exactly one chord: <8, 2>
- Cycle 20 has exactly one chord: <8, 4>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we find 12 chordal 4-cycles:
