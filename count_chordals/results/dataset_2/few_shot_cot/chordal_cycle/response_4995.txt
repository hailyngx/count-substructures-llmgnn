Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 17, 4>, chord: (14, 4, 17)
- Cycle 2: <0, 14, 8, 3>, chord: (14, 8, 3)
- Cycle 3: <0, 17, 4, 12>, chord: (17, 4, 12)
- Cycle 4: <3, 8, 19, 11>, chord: (8, 19, 11)
- Cycle 5: <11, 19, 17, 4>, chord: (19, 17, 4)
- Cycle 6: <4, 12, 13, 15>, chord: (12, 13, 15)
- Cycle 7: <7, 11, 1, 12>, chord: (11, 1, 12)
- Cycle 8: <7, 11, 15, 13>, chord: (11, 15, 13)
- Cycle 9: <7, 19, 17, 4>, chord: (19, 17, 4)
- Cycle 10: <9, 18, 14, 0>, chord: (18, 14, 0)
- Cycle 11: <9, 18, 16, 8>, chord: (18, 16, 8)
- Cycle 12: <9, 16, 8, 3>, chord: (16, 8, 3)
- Cycle 13: <9, 7, 11, 1>, chord: (7, 11, 1)
- Cycle 14: <9, 7, 5, 12>, chord: (7, 5, 12)
- Cycle 15: <18, 13, 12, 1>, chord: (13, 12, 1)
- Cycle 16: <18, 13, 15, 11>, chord: (13, 15, 11)
- Cycle 17: <18, 16, 9, 7>, chord: (16, 9, 7)
- Cycle 18: <18, 16, 2, 9>, chord: (16, 2, 9)
- Cycle 19: <19, 8, 3, 0>, chord: (8, 3, 0)
- Cycle 20: <19, 8, 16, 9>, chord: (8, 16, 9)
- Cycle 21: <19, 7, 5, 12>, chord: (7, 5, 12)

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the ones that have exactly one chord are: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 17, 4>, chord: (14, 4, 17)
- Cycle 4: <3, 8, 19, 11>, chord: (8, 19, 11)
- Cycle 6: <4, 12, 13, 15>, chord: (12, 13, 15)
- Cycle 8: <7, 11, 1, 12>, chord: (11, 1, 12)
- Cycle 11: <9, 18, 14, 0>, chord: (18, 14, 0)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [16].
