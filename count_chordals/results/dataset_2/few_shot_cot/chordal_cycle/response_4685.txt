- Cycle 5: <6, 1, 5, 9, 6>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 4, 6, 1>
- Cycle 7: <4, 5, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle 8: <5, 1, 6, 9, 5>
- Cycle 9: <1, 6, 9, 5, 1>

- Cycle 13: <6, 4, 5, 9, 6>
- Cycle 14: <0, 5, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 15: <3, 1, 6, 9, 3>
- Cycle 16: <2, 9, 5, 1, 2>
- Cycle 17: <8, 4, 5, 9, 8>
- Cycle 18: <7, 4, 5, 9, 7>
- Cycle 19: <0, 1, 6, 9, 0>
- Cycle 20: <3, 1, 5, 4, 3>
- Cycle 21: <2, 9, 6, 1, 2>
- Cycle 22: <8, 4, 6, 9, 8>
- Cycle 23: <7, 4, 6, 9, 7>
- Cycle 24: <0, 1, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle 25: <3, 1, 6, 4, 3>
- Cycle 26: <2, 9, 5, 4, 2>
- Cycle 27: <8, 6, 1, 5, 8>
- Cycle 28: <7, 8, 4, 5, 7>
- Cycle 29: <0, 1, 6, 4, 0>
- Cycle 30: <3, 1, 5, 9, 3>
- Cycle 31: <2, 9, 6, 4, 2>
- Cycle 32: <8, 6, 4, 5, 8>

- Cycle 37: <0, 3, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 38: <2, 8, 6, 1, 2>
- Cycle 39: <8, 7, 6, 9, 8>
- Cycle 40: <0, 3, 1, 6, 4>
- Cycle 41: <2, 8, 4, 6, 2>
- Cycle 42: <8, 7, 6, 4, 8>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 1, 5> - Chord: (9, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 4, 6, 9, 5> - Chord: (4, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 1, 6, 9, 5> - Chord: (1, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 1, 6, 9, 4> - Chord: (1, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 4, 1, 6, 5> - Chord: (4, 1)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

There are [0] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
