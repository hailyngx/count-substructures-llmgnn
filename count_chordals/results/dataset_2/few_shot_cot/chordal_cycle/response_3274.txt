Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (15, 27, 10, 19, 13, 1) 
- Cycle 2: (15, 27, 10, 4, 23, 4) 
- Cycle 3: (4, 23, 4, 11, 13, 1) 
- Cycle 4: (4, 23, 4, 10, 27, 15) 
- Cycle 5: (15, 27, 8, 25, 26, 17) 
- Cycle 6: (17, 26, 5, 7, 9, 6) 
- Cycle 7: (6, 29, 18, 22, 21, 2) 
- Cycle 8: (2, 21, 0, 15, 24, 17) 
- Cycle 9: (17, 24, 18, 29, 6, 3) 
- Cycle 10: (3, 6, 9, 10, 27, 8) 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <1, (15, 10), 13> has one chord (15, 10) 
- Cycle 2 <2, (15, 10), 4> has one chord (15, 10) 
- Cycle 3 <3, (4, 11), 13> has one chord (4, 11) 
- Cycle 4 <4, (15, 10), 23> has one chord (15, 10) 
- Cycle 5 <5, (17, 26), 25> has one chord (17, 26) 
- Cycle 6 <6, (5, 7), 9> has one chord (5, 7) 
- Cycle 7 <7, (2, 21), 18> has one chord (2, 21) 
- Cycle 8 <8, (15, 24), 17> has one chord (15, 24) 
- Cycle 9 <9, (17, 24), 6> has one chord (17, 24) 
- Cycle 10 <10, (8, 27), 9> has one chord (8, 27)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
