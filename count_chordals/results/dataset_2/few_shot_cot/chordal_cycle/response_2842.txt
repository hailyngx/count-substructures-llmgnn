- Chordal cycle <0, 4, 13, 8, 14> with chord (13, 14)
- Chordal cycle <0, 5, 11, 6, 3> with chord (5, 11)
- Chordal cycle <0, 9, 2, 11, 5> with chord (9, 11)
- Chordal cycle <1, 12, 11, 6, 15> with chord (12, 6)
- Chordal cycle <1, 12, 2, 9, 0> with chord (12, 9)
- Chordal cycle <3, 6, 15, 19, 7> with chord (6, 19)
- Chordal cycle <4, 8, 14, 1, 18> with chord (8, 1)
- Chordal cycle <5, 11, 6, 3, 16> with chord (11, 6)
- Chordal cycle <6, 3, 16, 0, 4> with chord (3, 16)
- Chordal cycle <8, 13, 4, 0, 9> with chord (13, 9)
- Chordal cycle <14, 5, 11, 2, 9> with chord (5, 2)
- Chordal cycle <16, 3, 6, 11, 2> with chord (3, 11)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [18].
