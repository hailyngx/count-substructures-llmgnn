Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 3, (0, 4), 5)>
<0, 4, (0, 11), 3)>
<0, 9, (0, 3), 1)>
<1, 3, (1, 6), 13)>
<1, 6, (1, 10), 13)>
<1, 7, (1, 3), 5)>
<1, 10, (1, 6), 13)>
<2, 8, (2, 10), 11)>
<2, 11, (2, 8), 5)>
<3, 5, (3, 7), 1)>
<3, 7, (3, 1), 5)>
<4, 5, (4, 0), 14)>
<4, 10, (4, 5), 7)>
<5, 7, (5, 3), 1)>
<5, 8, (5, 12), 6)>
<6, 8, (6, 1), 13)>
<7, 10, (7, 1), 3)>
<8, 11, (8, 2), 5)>
<9, 11, (9, 3), 1)>
<11, 14, (11, 0), 4)>

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [19].
