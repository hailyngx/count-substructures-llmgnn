Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are as follows:
- <0, 1, 14, 5> (Chord: 6)
- <0, 2, 7, 13> (Chord: 9)
- <0, 5, 4, 6> (Chord: 9)
- <3, 0, 5, 14> (Chord: 6)
- <4, 6, 1, 11> (Chord: 9)
- <5, 6, 1, 14> (Chord: 11)
- <7, 2, 13, 9> (Chord: 4)
- <9, 0, 5, 14> (Chord: 6)
- <9, 4, 7, 2> (Chord: 5)
- <12, 8, 10, 3> (Chord: 9)

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles is [60 - 10 = 50].
