Response:
Step 1: 
We will now list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 4, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 7, 14, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 2, 4, 11, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 3, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 10, 2, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 8, 3>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 13, 7, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 7, 4, 2, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 7, 13, 10, 1>
- Cycle 10: <2, 4, 11, 12, 2>
- Cycle 11: <2, 5, 11, 0, 2>
- Cycle 12: <2, 10, 13, 7, 2>
- Cycle 13: <3, 6, 1, 3>
- Cycle 14: <3, 6, 10, 13, 3>
- Cycle 15: <3, 8, 4, 12, 3>
- Cycle 16: <3, 13, 10, 12, 3>
- Cycle 17: <4, 9, 7, 13, 4>
- Cycle 18: <4, 11, 0, 9, 4>
- Cycle 19: <4, 12, 3, 8, 4>
- Cycle 20: <4, 12, 11, 5, 4>
- Cycle 21: <5, 7, 13, 10, 5>
- Cycle 22: <9, 4, 11, 0, 9>
- Cycle 23: <10, 2, 5, 11, 10>
- Cycle 24: <10, 6, 1, 7, 10>
- Cycle 25: <10, 12, 3, 13, 10>
- Cycle 26: <11, 0, 2, 5, 11>
- Cycle 27: <11, 4, 8, 3, 11>
- Cycle 28: <12, 3, 6, 10, 12>
- Cycle 29: <12, 4, 9, 7, 12>
- Cycle 30: <13, 3, 8, 4, 13>
- Cycle 31: <13, 7, 4, 9, 13>
- Cycle 32: <14, 0, 11, 12, 14>

Step 2:
Now we will check each of these cycles for exactly one chord:
- From the listed cycles, there are 9 cycles with exactly one chord:
  - <0, 9, 4, (2), 0>
  - <1, 6, (10), 2, 1>
  - <1, 7, 4, (2), 1>
  - <1, 7, (13), 10, 1>
  - <2, 5, (11), 0, 2>
  - <3, 6, 10, (13), 3>
  - <4, 11, 0, (9), 4>
  - <4, 12, 3, (8), 4>
  - <5, 7, (13), 10, 5>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have a total of [23].
