Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 3

Response:
In this graph, the chordal 4-cycle found is <5, 9, 4, 6> with a non-adjacent chord (5,6). 

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
