Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycles: 
<0, 9, 5, 14> (Chord: (9, 14))
<0, 19, 8, 4> (Chord: (19, 4))
<0, 3, 6, 13> (Chord: (3, 6))
<1, 10, 13, 6> (Chord: (10, 6))
<2, 9, 0, 3> (Chord: (9, 3))
<2, 14, 19, 8> (Chord: (14, 19))
<4, 8, 19, 14> (Chord: (8, 14))
<5, 9, 2, 7> (Chord: (9, 7))
<11, 5, 14, 19> (Chord: (5, 19))
<13, 6, 10, 1> (Chord: (6, 10))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [10] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
