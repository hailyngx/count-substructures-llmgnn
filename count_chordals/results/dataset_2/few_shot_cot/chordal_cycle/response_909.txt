- Cycle 17: <2, 14, 8, 5, 4>
- Cycle 18: <2, 14, 8, 13, 1>
- Cycle 19: <2, 14, 3, 12, 0>
- Cycle 20: <3, 9, 6, 10, 0>

- Cycle 26: <3, 12, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 27: <4, 12, 0, 2, 14>

- Cycle 34: <11, 10, 6, 9, 3>
- Cycle 35: <12, 0, 10, 1, 13>
- Cycle 36: <14, 4, 7, 12, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 4, 7, 5, 8> (Chord: (4, 5))
- <0, 4, 12, 3, 8> (Chord: (4, 3))
- <0, 10, 6, 9, 3> (Chord: (6, 9))
- <1, 13, 8, 5, 4> (Chord: (8, 5))
- <2, 14, 8, 5, 4> (Chord: (8, 5))
- <3, 9, 6, 10, 0> (Chord: (9, 10))
- <4, 12, 0, 2, 14> (Chord: (0, 2))
- <5, 4, 7, 12, 3> (Chord: (4, 12))
- <6, 9, 7, 12, 4> (Chord: (9, 12))
- <8, 5, 4, 7, 9> (Chord: (5, 7))
- <11, 1, 13, 8, 14> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <12, 0, 10, 1, 13> (Chord: (0, 10))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [12].
