Response:
Step 1: 
In this graph, the cycles of length 4 or more with all existing edges are as follows:
1. <0, 4, 8, 5, 0>
2. <0, 4, 8, 10, 7, 0>
3. <0, 4, 8, 12, 14, 13, 6, 0>
4. <0, 5, 8, 12, 14, 13, 6, 0>
5. <0, 5, 8, 10, 7, 0>
6. <0, 6, 13, 14, 12, 8, 4, 0>
7. <1, 9, 11, 8, 5, 0, 4, 6, 3, 7, 10, 12, 14, 13, 1>
8. <2, 8, 10, 7, 3, 6, 13, 14, 12, 11, 9, 2>
9. <2, 8, 12, 11, 9, 1, 13, 14, 9, 7, 10, 8>

Step 2:
Checking for the cycles with exactly one chord:
1. <0, 4, 8, 5, 0> - Chord: (0, 8)
2. <0, 5, 8, 12, 14, 13, 6, 0> - Chord: (8, 12)
3. <0, 5, 8, 10, 7, 0> - Chord: (5, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [6].
