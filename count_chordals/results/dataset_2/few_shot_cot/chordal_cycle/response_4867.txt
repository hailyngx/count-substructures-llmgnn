Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph. 
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 12, 9) with edges (1, 4), (4, 12), (12, 9), (9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 8, 10) with edges (1, 4), (4, 8), (8, 10), (10, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 10, 2, 5) with edges (1, 10), (10, 2), (2, 5), (5, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 13, 9, 0) with edges (3, 13), (13, 9), (9, 0), (0, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 13, 7, 0) with edges (3, 13), (13, 7), (7, 0), (0, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 13, 0, 6) with edges (3, 13), (13, 0), (0, 6), (6, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 5, 2, 12) with edges (3, 5), (5, 2), (2, 12), (12, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 11, 12) with edges (4, 8), (8, 11), (11, 12), (12, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 12, 14, 3) with edges (4, 12), (12, 14), (14, 3), (3, 4)
- Cycle 10: (5, 2, 12, 14) with edges (5, 2), (2, 12), (12, 14), (14, 5)
- Cycle 11: (11, 12, 2, 10) with edges (11, 12), (12, 2), (2, 10), (10, 11)
- Cycle 12: (11, 8, 5, 3) with edges (11, 8), (8, 5), (5, 3), (3, 11)
- Cycle 13: (13, 0, 6, 3) with edges (13, 0), (0, 6), (6, 3), (3, 13)

Step 2:
After checking each cycle, we find that the following cycle has exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge):
- Cycle 11: (11, 12, 2, 10) with chord (11, 10)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is therefore [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <11, (11, 10), 12, 2>.
