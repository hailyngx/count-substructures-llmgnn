Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 2, 11, 1> with no chords
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 2, 13, 12, 7> with no chords
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 2, 14, 7, 6> with no chords
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 2, 11, 1, 8> with no chords
- Cycle 5: <0, 5, 2, 14, 7, 8> with no chords
- Cycle 6: <0, 9, 11, 1, 8> with no chords
- Cycle 7: <0, 9, 11, 1, 14, 6> with no chords
- Cycle 8: <0, 9, 12, 7, 6> with the chord (12, 9)
- Cycle 9: <0, 9, 12, 13, 6> with no chords
- Cycle 10: <0, 9, 12, 13, 3, 14> with no chords
- Cycle 11: <0, 9, 12, 7, 14, 1> with no chords
- Cycle 12: <0, 11, 1, 8, 7> with no chords
- Cycle 13: <0, 11, 2, 13, 12, 7> with no chords
- Cycle 14: <0, 11, 2, 13, 3, 14> with no chords
- Cycle 15: <0, 11, 2, 5, 7, 14> with the chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 16: <0, 11, 1, 14, 7, 8> with no chords
- Cycle 17: <0, 11, 1, 14, 3, 13> with no chords

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Among the cycles listed above, Cycle 8: <0, 9, 12, 7, 6> has exactly one chord (12, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- The number of chordless cycles found is [16].
