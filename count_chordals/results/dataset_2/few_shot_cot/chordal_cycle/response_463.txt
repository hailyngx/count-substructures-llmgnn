Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 7 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 8 - 1 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 7 - 4 - 8 - 5
- Cycle 4: 7 - 4 - 3 - 8 - 7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (5, 7), 5> (Chord: (5, 7))
- Cycle 2: <2, (5, 8), 5> (Chord: (5, 8))
- Cycle 3: Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, (7, 8), 5> (Chord: (7, 8))
- Cycle 4: Chordal 4-cycle found: <4, (4, 8), 7> (Chord: (4, 8))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are [2] chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].
