Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (4, 1, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 1, 9, 8, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 2, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 3, 1, 6, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 7, 6, 3, 4)
- Cycle 6: (7, 3, 1, 6, 7)
- Cycle 7: (7, 6, 1, 4, 7)
- Cycle 8: (6, 1, 9, 8, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 3, 4, 7, 6)
- Cycle 10: (1, 4, 8, 9, 1)
- Cycle 11: (1, 3, 6, 9, 1)
- Cycle 12: (2, 4, 8, 5, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 6, 7, 5, 2)
- Cycle 14: (2, 5, 8, 4, 2)
- Cycle 15: (6, 7, 5, 8, 6)
- Cycle 16: (7, 4, 8, 5, 7)
- Cycle 17: (8, 4, 2, 5, 8)
- Cycle 18: (8, 5, 7, 4, 8)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- The cycle <4, 1, 6, 7, 4> has a chord (1, 6). <1, (1, 6), 6> 
- The cycle <4, 1, 9, 8, 4> has a chord (1, 8). <2, (1, 8), 8>
- The cycle <4, 2, 6, 7, 4> has a chord (2, 7). <3, (2, 7), 7>
- The cycle <4, 3, 1, 6, 4> has a chord (3, 6). <4, (3, 6), 6>
- The cycle <4, 7, 6, 3, 4> has a chord (7, 3). <5, (7, 3), 3>
- The cycle <7, 3, 1, 6, 7> has a chord (3, 6). <6, (3, 6), 6>
- The cycle <7, 6, 1, 4, 7> has a chord (6, 4). <7, (6, 4), 4>
- The cycle <6, 1, 9, 8, 6> has a chord (1, 8). <8, (1, 8), 8> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [10]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
