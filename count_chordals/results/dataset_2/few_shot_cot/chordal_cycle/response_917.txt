Response:
The requested information is as follows:

Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 1, 8, 0>
- <0, 5, 1, 3, 14, 0>
- <0, 5, 1, 10, 0>
- <0, 5, 1, 14, 2, 0>
- <0, 5, 1, 14, 3, 13, 10, 0>
- <0, 5, 1, 14, 11, 7, 4, 0>
- <0, 5, 1, 14, 11, 7, 9, 4, 0>
- <0, 4, 6, 10, 0>
- <0, 4, 6, 10, 13, 2, 0>
- <0, 4, 6, 10, 13, 3, 1, 5, 0>
- <0, 4, 7, 5, 1, 8, 2, 0>
- <0, 4, 7, 5, 1, 14, 2, 0>
- <0, 4, 7, 5, 1, 14, 3, 13, 10, 0>
- <0, 4, 7, 5, 1, 14, 11, 7, 9, 12, 10, 0>
- <0, 4, 7, 9, 5, 1, 8, 2, 0>
- <0, 4, 7, 9, 5, 1, 14, 2, 0>
- <0, 4, 7, 9, 5, 1, 14, 3, 13, 10, 0>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 1, 8, 0> has no chord
- <0, 5, 1, 3, 14, 0> has chord (1, 3)
- <0, 5, 1, 10, 0> has no chord
- <0, 5, 1, 14, 2, 0> has chord (1, 2)
- <0, 5, 1, 14, 3, 13, 10, 0> has chord (14, 13)
- <0, 5, 1, 14, 11, 7, 4, 0> has chord (1, 4)
- <0, 5, 1, 14, 11, 7, 9, 4, 0> has chord (7, 9)
- <0, 4, 6, 10, 0> has no chord
- <0, 4, 6, 10, 13, 2, 0> has chord (10, 13)
- <0, 4, 6, 10, 13, 3, 1, 5, 0> has chord (6, 5)
- <0, 4, 7, 5, 1, 8, 2, 0> has chord (5, 2)
- <0, 4, 7, 5, 1, 14, 2, 0> has chord (5, 14)
- <0, 4, 7, 5, 1, 14, 3, 13, 10, 0> has chord (1, 3)
- <0, 4, 7, 5, 1, 14, 11, 7, 9, 12, 10, 0> has chord (4, 9)
- <0, 4, 7, 9, 5, 1, 8, 2, 0> has chord (9, 8)
- <0, 4, 7, 9, 5, 1, 14, 2, 0> has chord (9, 14)
- <0, 4, 7, 9, 5, 1, 14, 3, 13, 10, 0> has chord (7, 3)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
- There are [11] chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph.
