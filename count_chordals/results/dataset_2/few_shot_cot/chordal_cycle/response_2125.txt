Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 20, 1, 3, 0> has chord (1, 20)
- <0, 25, 21, 15, 0> has chord (21, 15)
- <3, 14, 9, 13, 3> has chord (9, 14)
- <4, 10, 15, 21, 4> has chord (10, 15)
- <7, 21, 15, 12, 7> has chord (15, 12)
- <7, 28, 8, 14, 7> has chord (8, 14)
- <9, 24, 18, 1, 9> has chord (1, 18)
- <21, 7, 28, 8, 21> has chord (7, 28)
- <25, 21, 15, 12, 25> has chord (15, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 43.
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [43].
