Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 4, 5, 12, 9) with chord (5, 9), <1, (5, 9), 2, 3)>
- Cycle 2: (4, 5, 10, 11, 9) with chord (5, 11), <4, (5, 11), 7, 8)>
- Cycle 3: (2, 8, 5, 10, 11) with chord (8, 10), <2, (8, 10), 1, 4)>
- Cycle 4: (2, 8, 14, 11, 9) with chord (8, 11), <2, (8, 11), 0, 7)>
- Cycle 5: (3, 0, 13, 7, 4) with chord (0, 7), <3, (0, 7), 12, 1)>
- Cycle 6: (6, 11, 14, 8, 5) with chord (11, 8), <6, (11, 8), 9, 10)>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (5, 9). It is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (5, 11). It is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord (8, 10). It is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord (8, 11). It is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord (0, 7). It is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord (11, 8). It is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [6].
