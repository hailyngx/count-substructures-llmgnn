Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 4, 7>
2. <0, 1, 8, 3>
3. <0, 1, 4, 2>
4. <0, 3, 8, 5>
5. <0, 3, 6, 7>
6. <0, 4, 2, 9>
7. <1, 7, 6, 9>
8. <1, 4, 2, 9>
9. <3, 6, 9, 8>
10. <4, 7, 5, 8>
11. <5, 7, 6, 9>

Step 2:

The list of cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) is:
1. <1, (2, 9), 4, 7>
2. <0, 1, (4, 2), 9>
3. <3, (6, 9), 8, 5>
4. <4, 7, 5, (8, 6)>

Step 3:

Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord gives [4]. 

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are <1, (2, 9), 4, 7>, <0, 1, (4, 2), 9>, <3, (6, 9), 8, 5>, and <4, 7, 5, (8, 6)>.
