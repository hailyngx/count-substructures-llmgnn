Step 2: Check for chords in each cycle:
- <1, 9, 14, 17, 10, 7, 24, 18, 14> has one chord (14, 24)
- <3, 6, 20, 21, 29, 23, 13, 3> has one chord (6, 23)
- <5, 11, 7, 8, 27, 19, 4, 19, 1, 9, 14, 23, 13, 12, 2, 25, 26, 22, 0, 11> has one chord (19, 14)
- <13, 3, 6, 20, 21, 9, 14, 18, 24, 7, 8, 15> has one chord (14, 15)
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 9 chordal 4-cycles identified, so the count is [9].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <1, 9, 14, 17, 10, 7, 24, (18, 14)>
2. <3, 6, 20, 21, 29, 23, 13, (2, 3)>
3. <5, 11, 7, 8, 27, 19, 4, 19, 1, 9, 14, 23, 13, 12, 2, 25, 26, 22, 0, (11, 19)>
4. <13, 3, 6, 20, 21, 9, 14, 18, 24, 7, 8, (15, 14)>
