Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 6, 18, 7, 14>
- Cycle 2: <6, 11, 17, 14>
- Cycle 3: <8, 3, 11, 6>
- Cycle 4: <8, 12, 6, 18>
- Cycle 5: <3, 11, 17, 14>
- Cycle 6: <3, 19, 4, 6>
- Cycle 7: <0, 14, 17, 11>
- Cycle 8: <0, 14, 7, 15>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-Cycle 1: <5, 6, 18, 7> with chord (14, 17)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
