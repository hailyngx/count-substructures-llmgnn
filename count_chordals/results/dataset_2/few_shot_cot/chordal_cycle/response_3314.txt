Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
After checking each cycle, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<0, 24, 17, 4> (Chord: 24-4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the count is [1].
