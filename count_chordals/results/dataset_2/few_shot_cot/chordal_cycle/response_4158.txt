Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph along with the non-adjacent chords is:
<5, 10, 7, 14> (12, 0) 

Following the steps provided in the prompt:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- (5, 12, 7, 10)
- (5, 0, 14, 4)
- (5, 10, 7, 4)
- (5, 10, 0, 14)
- (12, 7, 4, 8)
- (12, 7, 10, 0)
- (12, 2, 8, 9) *Note: This is a 4-cycle but not considered for chordal 4-cycles calculations due to lack of edges between some node pairs.
- (7, 4, 8, 9) *Note: This is a 4-cycle but not considered for chordal 4-cycles calculations due to lack of edges between some node pairs.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- (5, 12, 7, 10) has a chord 12–10
- (5, 0, 14, 4) has a chord 14–5
- (5, 10, 7, 4) has a chord 10–7
- (5, 10, 0, 14) has a chord 10–0
- (12, 7, 4, 8) does not have a chord
- (12, 7, 10, 0) has a chord 12–10
- (12, 2, 8, 9) does not have a chord
- (7, 4, 8, 9) does not have a chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. Only the cycles with exactly one chord are considered.
- Number of chordal 4-cycles = [4]
