Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. <0, 2, 9, 1, 8>
2. <0, 2, 14, 7, 3>
3. <0, 8, 1, 9, 5>
4. <1, 9, 6, 13, 4>
5. <2, 9, 5, 14, 7>
6. <2, 9, 1, 3, 7>
7. <3, 7, 14, 5, 9>
8. <4, 13, 6, 9, 5>
9. <4, 13, 8, 2, 9>
10. <5, 14, 7, 3, 11>
11. <6, 13, 1, 9, 5>
12. <7, 3, 1, 9, 5>
13. <8, 13, 6, 9, 5>
14. <9, 5, 14, 7, 3>
15. <10, 12, 5, 9, 6>
16. <11, 7, 14, 6, 13>
17. <12, 5, 14, 7, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

1. <0, (2, 9), 1, 8>
2. <0, (2, 14), 7, 3>
3. <0, 8, 1, (9, 5)>
4. <1, 9, (6, 13), 4>
5. <2, 9, (5, 14), 7>
6. <2, (9, 1), 3, 7>
7. <3, 7, 14, (5, 9)>
8. <4, 13, 6, (9, 5)>
9. <4, 13, (8, 2), 9>
10. <5, 14, 7, (3, 11)>
11. <6, 13, 1, (9, 5)>
12. <7, 3, 1, (9, 5)>
13. <8, 13, 6, (9, 5)>
14. <9, 5, 14, (7, 3)>
15. <10, 12, 5, 9, (6, 13)>
16. <11, 7, 14, 6, (13, 4)>
17. <12, 5, 14, 7, (3, 11)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

There are no chordal 4-cycles found in this graph.
