Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <0, 16, 12, 14>
        - <0, 10, 2, 14>
        - <0, 10, 2, 7>
        - <0, 10, 12, 14>
        - <1, 11, 5, 6>
        - <1, 11, 5, 9>
        - <1, 11, 9, 4>
        - <1, 19, 3, 7>
        - <2, 10, 18, 11>
        - <3, 7, 2, 10>
        - <4, 17, 6, 13>
        - <4, 17, 13, 3>
        - <4, 17, 13, 6>
        - <5, 9, 4, 15>
        - <6, 5, 9, 4>
        - <6, 13, 3, 7>
        - <6, 13, 17, 4>
        - <7, 3, 13, 17>
        - <8, 1, 11, 18>
        - <10, 2, 7, 16>
        - <10, 12, 14, 2>
        - <10, 12, 16, 0>
        - <11, 1, 19, 3>
        - <12, 16, 0, 10>
        - <13, 17, 4, 15>
        - <14, 2, 7, 3>
        - <16, 0, 10, 12>
        - <17, 4, 15, 16>
        - <18, 11, 5, 6>
        - <18, 11, 1, 19>
        
Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <0, 16, 12, 14> (Chord: (12, 16))
        - <0, 10, 2, 7> (Chord: (2, 10))
        - <1, 11, 5, 9> (Chord: (5, 9))
        - <1, 19, 3, 7> (Chord: (3, 19))
        - <4, 17, 6, 13> (Chord: (6, 17))
        - <5, 9, 4, 15> (Chord: (4, 9))
        - <6, 13, 17, 4> (Chord: (13, 17))
        - <7, 3, 13, 17> (Chord: (13, 17))
        - <8, 1, 11, 18> (Chord: (11, 1))
        - <18, 11, 5, 6> (Chord: (5, 11))
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        [10]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 16, 12, 14> with chord (12, 16)
<0, 10, 2, 7> with chord (2, 10)
<1, 11, 5, 9> with chord (5, 9)
<1, 19, 3, 7> with chord (3, 19)
<4, 17, 6, 13> with chord (6, 17)
<5, 9, 4, 15> with chord (4, 9)
<6, 13, 17, 4> with chord (13, 17)
<7, 3, 13, 17> with chord (13, 17)
<8, 1, 11, 18> with chord (11, 1)
<18, 11, 5, 6> with chord (5, 11)
