Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-6-0 (chord: 4-6-4)
- Cycle 2: 0-6-1-3-0 (chord: 1-3-1)
- Cycle 3: 0-4-7-3-0 (chord: 7-3-7)
- Cycle 4: 0-8-7-3-0 (chord: 7-3-7)
- Cycle 5: 1-3-7-4-1 (chord: 7-4-7)
- Cycle 6: 1-6-4-7-1 (chord: 4-7-4)
- Cycle 7: 1-6-7-8-1 (chord: 7-8-7)
- Cycle 8: 2-5-9-8-2 (chord: 9-8-9)
- Cycle 9: 3-7-4-0-3 (chord: 4-0-4)
- Cycle 10: 3-7-8-9-3 (chord: 8-9-8)
- Cycle 11: 4-6-1-3-4 (chord: 1-3-1)
- Cycle 12: 4-7-8-9-4 (chord: 8-9-8)
- Cycle 13: 6-1-3-7-6 (chord: 3-7-3)
- Cycle 14: 6-4-7-3-6 (chord: 7-3-7)
- Cycle 15: 7-4-6-1-7 (chord: 6-1-6)
- Cycle 16: 7-3-1-6-7 (chord: 1-6-1)
- Cycle 17: 8-9-5-2-8 (chord: 5-2-5)
- Cycle 18: 8-7-4-6-8 (chord: 4-6-4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 10 (3-7-8-9-3) has exactly one chord (8-9-8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <3, 7, 8, 9>
