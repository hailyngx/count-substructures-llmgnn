Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 5, 9>
2. <0, 7, 5, 9>
3. <0, 7, 6, 9>
4. <1, 5, 9, 6>
5. <1, 5, 4, 9>
6. <2, 6, 9, 5>
7. <2, 6, 9, 7>
8. <3, 5, 9, 6>
9. <3, 6, 9, 7>
10. <3, 2, 4, 7>
11. <4, 5, 7, 0>
12. <4, 5, 9, 6>
13. <4, 7, 9, 6>
14. <5, 1, 0, 7>
15. <5, 1, 0, 8>
16. <5, 1, 0, 7>
17. <5, 4, 7, 0>
18. <6, 9, 5, 1>
19. <6, 9, 5, 7>
20. <7, 0, 8, 6>
21. <7, 0, 8, 3>
22. <7, 4, 2, 3>
23. <9, 5, 1, 0>
24. <9, 5, 1, 0>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, 1, 5, 9> (Chord: (5, 9)) 
2. <0, 7, 6, 9> (Chord: (6, 9))
3. <1, 5, 9, 6> (Chord: (5, 6))
4. <1, 5, 4, 9> (Chord: (4, 9))

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [4].
