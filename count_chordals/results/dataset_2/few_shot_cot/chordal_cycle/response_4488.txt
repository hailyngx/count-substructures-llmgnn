Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
    - <5, 9, 4, 2>
    - <5, 9, 1, 7>
    - <5, 9, 3, 4>
    - <5, 9, 3, 6>
    - <5, 1, 7, 0>
    - <5, 1, 2, 6>
    - <5, 1, 2, 4>
    - <5, 2, 4, 9>
    - <5, 2, 4, 3>
    - <5, 2, 6, 3>
    - <5, 8, 0, 7>
    - <5, 8, 3, 9>
    - <5, 8, 7, 0>
    - <9, 4, 2, 6>
    - <9, 4, 3, 6>
    - <9, 1, 7, 0>
    - <9, 1, 7, 8>
    - <9, 1, 2, 5>
    - <9, 3, 4, 2>
    - <9, 3, 4, 5>
    - <9, 3, 6, 5>
    - <9, 7, 1, 5>
    - <9, 7, 0, 8>
    - <4, 2, 5, 9>
    - <4, 3, 6, 5>
    - <4, 3, 9, 5>
    - <7, 0, 8, 5>
    - <7, 1, 5, 9>
    - <7, 1, 2, 5>
    - <7, 8, 0, 5>
    - <6, 2, 1, 5>
    - <6, 3, 4, 2>
    - <6, 3, 9, 5>
    - <0, 7, 1, 5>
    - <0, 7, 8, 5>
    - <3, 4, 2, 5>
    - <3, 4, 9, 5>
    - <3, 6, 5, 9>
    - <2, 4, 9, 5>
  
Step 2: Checking for chords:
    - Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
        - <4, (2, 6), 9>
        - <1, (7, 0), 5>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [32]
