Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 8, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<0, 4, 1, 7>  
<0, 4, 2, 8>  
<0, 4, 7, 5>  
<0, 4, 2, 6>  
<0, 9, 3, 1>  
<0, 9, 1, 4>  
<0, 9, 2, 5>  
<1, 4, 2, 6>  
<1, 4, 7, 5>  
<1, 7, 5, 2>  
<1, 7, 4, 2>  
<1, 9, 2, 5>  
<1, 9, 3, 0>  
<2, 4, 7, 1>  
<2, 4, 0, 8>  
<2, 5, 0, 4>  
<2, 5, 7, 1>  
<2, 6, 1, 4>  
<2, 6, 4, 0>  
<3, 1, 4, 7>  
<3, 1, 7, 5>  
<3, 0, 4, 7>  
<3, 0, 9, 1>  
<3, 8, 2, 4>  
<4, 1, 7, 5>  
<4, 2, 0, 8>  
<4, 7, 5, 2>  
<4, 7, 0, 1>  
<5, 7, 1, 4>  
<5, 7, 4, 0>  
<6, 1, 4, 7>  
<6, 2, 0, 8>  
<7, 1, 4, 2>  
<7, 5, 0, 4>  
<8, 0, 4, 2>  
<9, 1, 4, 7>  
<9, 1, 7, 5>  
<9, 0, 4, 7>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<0, 4, 1, 7>: Chord (1, 7)  
<0, 4, 2, 8>: Chord (2, 8)  
<0, 9, 3, 1>: Chord (3, 1)  
<0, 9, 2, 5>: Chord (2, 5)  
<1, 4, 2, 6>: Chord (2, 6)  
<1, 7, 4, 2>: Chord (4, 2)  
<2, 4, 7, 1>: Chord (7, 1)  
<2, 5, 7, 1>: Chord (7, 1)  
<2, 6, 1, 4>: Chord (1, 4)  
<3, 1, 7, 5>: Chord (7, 5)  
<3, 0, 9, 1>: Chord (9, 1)  
<4, 7, 5, 2>: Chord (5, 2)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 6 chordless cycles found, so the answer is [6].
