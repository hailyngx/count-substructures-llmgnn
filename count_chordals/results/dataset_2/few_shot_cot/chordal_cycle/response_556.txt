Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 are:
1. <0, 2, 14, 7, 0>
2. <0, 2, 6, 17, 9, 4, 8, 0>
3. <0, 8, 4, 3, 14, 7, 0>
4. <1, 8, 4, 3, 14, 1>
5. <2, 6, 3, 14, 2>
6. <2, 14, 7, 0, 2>
7. <3, 4, 8, 0, 3>
8. <3, 6, 2, 14, 3>
9. <4, 8, 0, 2, 4>
10. <6, 2, 0, 8, 1, 14, 3, 6>
11. <7, 0, 2, 6, 3, 14, 7>
12. <9, 4, 8, 0, 10, 15, 13, 9>
13. <11, 16, 19, 15, 12, 18, 11>
14. <13, 6, 2, 14, 15, 12, 18, 13>
15. <14, 1, 8, 4, 9, 17, 6, 13, 15, 14>
16. <15, 10, 0, 2, 6, 17, 16, 19, 15>
17. <16, 11, 18, 12, 15, 19, 16>
18. <17, 16, 19, 15, 13, 6, 2, 14, 3, 7, 17>
19. <18, 12, 9, 4, 8, 0, 10, 15, 14, 1, 18>
20. <19, 16, 17, 6, 2, 0, 8, 4, 5, 19>

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 2, 6, 17, 9, 4, 8, 0> (Chord: 4-8)
2. <1, 8, 4, 3, 14, 1> (Chord: 4-14)
3. <11, 16, 19, 15, 12, 18, 11> (Chord: 16-15)

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found = 20 - 3 = 17

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [17].
