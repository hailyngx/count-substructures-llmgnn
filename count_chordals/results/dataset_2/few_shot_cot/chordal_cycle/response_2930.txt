Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. <0, 15, 2, 15> 
2. <0, 15, 3, 18> 
3. <0, 15, 3, 6> 
4. <0, 15, 3, 7> 
5. <0, 4, 12, 8> 
6. <0, 4, 12, 6> 
7. <0, 4, 12, 1> 
8. <0, 4, 16, 7> 
9. <0, 6, 12, 8> 
10. <0, 6, 12, 4> 
11. <0, 6, 12, 1> 
12. <0, 6, 3, 15> 
13. <0, 6, 3, 7> 
14. <0, 6, 17, 11> 
15. <0, 17, 11, 10> 
16. <0, 17, 11, 19> 
17. <0, 17, 6, 3> 
18. <1, 12, 4, 19> 
19. <2, 15, 3, 18> 
20. <3, 6, 12, 8> 
21. <3, 6, 12, 4> 
22. <3, 6, 12, 1> 
23. <3, 7, 16, 4> 
24. <4, 12, 6, 17> 
25. <4, 12, 1, 12> 
26. <4, 16, 19, 4> 
27. <5, 8, 13, 10> 
28. <6, 12, 4, 19> 
29. <6, 12, 1, 12> 
30. <7, 14, 12, 8> 
31. <15, 3, 6, 12> 
32. <15, 3, 7, 14> 
33. <16, 4, 12, 8> 
34. <16, 4, 19, 11> 
35. <17, 6, 12, 8> 
36. <17, 6, 12, 4> 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. <0, 15, 3, 18> [Chord: (15, 3)]
2. <0, 15, 3, 6> [Chord: (15, 3)]
3. <0, 6, 12, 8> [Chord: (6, 12)]
4. <0, 6, 12, 4> [Chord: (6, 12)]
5. <0, 6, 12, 1> [Chord: (6, 12)]
6. <0, 17, 11, 10> [Chord: (11, 10)]
7. <1, 12, 4, 19> [Chord: (12, 4)]
8. <3, 6, 12, 8> [Chord: (6, 12)]
9. <3, 6, 12, 4> [Chord: (6, 12)]
10. <3, 6, 12, 1> [Chord: (6, 12)]
11. <4, 12, 6, 17> [Chord: (12, 6)]
12. <4, 16, 19, 4> [Chord: (19, 4)]
13. <5, 8, 13, 10> [Chord: (8, 13)]
14. <7, 14, 12, 8> [Chord: (14, 12)]
15. <15, 3, 6, 12> [Chord: (3, 6)]

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = [2]
