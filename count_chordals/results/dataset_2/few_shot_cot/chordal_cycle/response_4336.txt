Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <3, 5, 9, 7, 8>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 5, 4, 2>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 5, 8, 7>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 6, 5, 3>
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 6, 3, 1>
- Cycle 6: <3, 6, 5, 4, 2>
- Cycle 7: <0, 4, 5, 9, 6>
- Cycle 8: <0, 4, 5, 8, 7>
- Cycle 9: <7, 9, 5, 8, 0>
- Cycle 10: <1, 4, 5, 9, 0>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Out of the above cycles, only Cycle 10: <1, 4, 5, 9, 0> has exactly one chord: (4, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 9.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
