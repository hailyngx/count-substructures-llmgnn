Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 5) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2: 
There are no chorded cycles in the given graph.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 0, therefore, the answer is [0].
