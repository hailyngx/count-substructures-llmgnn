Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 0, 13, 4, 5, 11, 9, 10, 12, 7, 8, 14)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 2, 5, 8, 7, 12, 10)
- Cycle 3: (0, 3, 2, 5, 11, 9, 10, 12)
- Cycle 4: (0, 13, 4, 5, 8, 7, 12)
- Cycle 5: (0, 13, 9, 11, 5, 2, 12)
- Cycle 6: (0, 9, 11, 5, 8, 7, 12)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1, 14).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (3, 12).
- Cycle 4 has a chord (8, 5).
- Cycle 5 has no chords.
- Cycle 6 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are a total of 2 chordal 4-cycles, namely:
[2]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (1, 14), 3, 0, 13, 4, 5, 11, 9, 10, 12, 7, 8, 14)>
- <2, (3, 12), 5, 11, 9, 10, 12, 7, 8>
