Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: (13, 22, 18, 6, 13)
- Cycle 2: (13, 5, 24, 3, 13)
- Cycle 3: (13, 23, 2, 21, 6, 18, 22, 13)
- Cycle 4: (22, 18, 26, 24, 23, 2, 21, 6, 22)
- Cycle 5: (17, 25, 2, 21, 6, 18, 22, 20, 9, 0, 12, 21, 17)
- Cycle 6: (17, 3, 24, 26, 18, 15, 16, 6, 25, 2, 23, 13, 3)
- Cycle 7: (25, 6, 21, 12, 0, 1, 18, 26, 24, 5, 17, 19, 11, 8, 28, 7, 10, 4, 29, 27, 8, 25)
- Cycle 8: (21, 12, 0, 1, 6, 25, 17, 5, 24, 26, 11, 19, 17, 25, 6)

Step 2:
Out of the identified cycles above, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are: 
- <1, (18, 6), 16>
- <2, (6, 21), 15>
- <13, (2, 23), 22>
- <17, (6, 21), 25>
- <21, (0, 12), 8>

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
