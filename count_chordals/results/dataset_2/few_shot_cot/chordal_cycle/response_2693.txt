Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle: <0, 5, 1, 3, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 1, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 1, 9, 8, 3, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 3, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 3, 1, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 3, 1, 9, 8, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 3, 7, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 4, 6, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 4, 6, 9, 8, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 4, 6, 9, 1, 7, 0>
  
Step 2: Check for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle <0, 5, 1, 3, 0> has a chord (1, 3)
- Cycle <0, 5, 1, 7, 0> has a chord (1, 7)
- Cycle <0, 5, 1, 9, 6, 0> has a chord (1, 9)
- Cycle <0, 5, 1, 9, 8, 3, 0> has no chord
- Cycle <0, 5, 3, 1, 7, 0> has a chord (1, 7)
- Cycle <0, 5, 3, 1, 9, 6, 0> has a chord (1, 9)
- Cycle <0, 5, 3, 1, 9, 8, 0> has a chord (1, 9)
- Cycle <0, 5, 3, 7, 0> has a chord (3, 7)
- Cycle <0, 5, 4, 6, 0> has a chord (4, 6)
- Cycle <0, 5, 4, 6, 9, 8, 0> has a chord (4, 6)
- Cycle <0, 5, 4, 6, 9, 1, 7, 0> has a chord (4, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<0, 5, 1, 9, 8, 3, 0>
