Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <1, 9, 8, 4, 3>
- Cycle 2: <2, 9, 8, 4, 3>
- Cycle 3: <3, 9, 8, 4, 3>
- Cycle 4: <4, 8, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle 5: <0, 7, 4, 8, 9>
- Cycle 6: <5, 4, 8, 9, 6>
- Cycle 7: <6, 9, 8, 4, 5>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <1, 4>
- Cycle 2 has a chord <2, 3>
- Cycle 3 has a chord <3, 4>
- Cycle 4 has a chord <4, 9>
- Cycle 5 has a chord <0, 8>
- Cycle 6 has a chord <5, 9>
- Cycle 7 has a chord <6, 8>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
