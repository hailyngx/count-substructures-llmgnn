Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 2) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 5, 1, 9>
2. <0, 5, 1, 4>
3. <0, 5, 1, 3>
4. <0, 9, 4, 7>
5. <0, 9, 4, 3>
6. <0, 9, 4, 1>
7. <0, 9, 7, 4>
8. <1, 5, 0, 3>
9. <1, 5, 3, 7>
10. <1, 9, 4, 7>
11. <1, 9, 4, 3>
12. <1, 9, 7, 4>
13. <2, 1, 5, 3>
14. <2, 1, 3, 7>
15. <2, 1, 8, 7>
16. <2, 1, 8, 3>
17. <3, 5, 1, 9>
18. <3, 5, 1, 4>
19. <3, 5, 1, 0>
20. <3, 4, 7, 9>
21. <4, 9, 7, 3>
22. <4, 9, 1, 5>
23. <6, 9, 4, 7>
24. <7, 9, 4, 3>
25. <7, 4, 3, 5>
26. <8, 1, 5, 3>
27. <8, 1, 3, 7>
28. <8, 2, 6, 9>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found with exactly one chord is <2, (1, 3), 7>.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [27].
