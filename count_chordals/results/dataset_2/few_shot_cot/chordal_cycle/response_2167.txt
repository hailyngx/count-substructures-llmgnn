Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 13) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 2) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 0) (10, 12) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 5) (11, 0) (11, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 10) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 14) (2, 7) (14, 9) (14, 2) (14, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 10) (7, 2) (7, 14) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 5) (12, 6) (12, 10) (4, 6) (4, 13) (4, 10) (4, 11) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 13, 11, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, 5, 14, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, 13, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 13, 10, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 10, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 12, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 10, 2, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 13, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 14, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 12, 7, 4, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 0, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 6, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 7

Response:
There are two unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph:
1. <1, (7, 14), 9, 8>
2. <5, (2, 14), 7, 10>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [2].
