Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
<1, 8, 12, 13>, <1, 8, 12, 5>, <1, 8, 11, 6>, <1, 8, 11, 7>, <1, 7, 11, 8>, <1, 7, 11, 6>, <1, 7, 14, 8>, <1, 7, 14, 2>, <1, 7, 3, 6>, <1, 9, 4, 13>, <1, 9, 4, 12>, <1, 9, 4, 7>, <1, 9, 10, 3>, <1, 3, 6, 11>, <1, 3, 6, 13>, <1, 3, 7, 11>, <1, 3, 7, 14>, <1, 3, 10, 12>, <2, 14, 8, 11>, <4, 9, 7, 11>, <4, 9, 10, 3>, <4, 12, 10, 3>, <5, 8, 11, 6>, <5, 12, 10, 3>
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
<1, 8, 12, 13> - Chord: (8, 12)
<1, 8, 12, 5> - Chord: (12, 8)
<1, 8, 11, 6> - Chord: (8, 11)
<1, 8, 11, 7> - Chord: (8, 11)
<1, 7, 11, 8> - Chord: (7, 11)
<1, 7, 11, 6> - Chord: (7, 11)
<1, 7, 14, 8> - Chord: (8, 14)
<1, 7, 14, 2> - Chord: (14, 2)
<1, 7, 3, 6> - Chord: (3, 6)
<1, 9, 4, 13> - Chord: (4, 13)
<1, 9, 4, 12> - Chord: (4, 12)
<1, 9, 4, 7> - Chord: (4, 7)
<1, 9, 10, 3> - Chord: (9, 10)
<1, 3, 6, 11> - Chord: (3, 6)
<1, 3, 6, 13> - Chord: (3, 6)
<1, 3, 7, 11> - Chord: (7, 11)
<1, 3, 7, 14> - Chord: (7, 14)
<1, 3, 10, 12> - Chord: (3, 10)
<2, 14, 8, 11> - Chord: (8, 14)
<4, 9, 7, 11> - Chord: (9, 7)
<4, 9, 10, 3> - Chord: (9, 10)
<4, 12, 10, 3> - Chord: (12, 10)
<5, 8, 11, 6> - Chord: (8, 11)
<5, 12, 10, 3> - Chord: (12, 10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of [25] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
