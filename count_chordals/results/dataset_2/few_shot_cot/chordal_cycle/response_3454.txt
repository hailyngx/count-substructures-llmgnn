Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph, but we want to focus on those that are chordal. One such chordal 4-cycle in this graph is:
<1, 20, 15, 7>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycle <1, 20, 15, 7> has one chord, which is the edge connecting nodes 20 and 7: (20, 7).

Step 3:
After analyzing all the cycles, we found only one chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
