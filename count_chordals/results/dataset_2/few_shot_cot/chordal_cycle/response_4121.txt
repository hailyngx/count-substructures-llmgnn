Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<0, 5, 23, 19>
<0, 13, 21, 28>
<0, 12, 20, 27>
<0, 12, 10, 4>
<0, 12, 1, 25>
<0, 18, 13, 21>
<0, 18, 13, 21, 17>
<0, 18, 13, 21, 28>
<0, 18, 13, 21, 28, 2>
<0, 9, 16, 19>
<0, 9, 16, 19, 23>
<0, 9, 16, 19, 23, 5>
<0, 9, 7, 14>
<0, 9, 7, 14, 6>
<1, 12, 20, 17>
<1, 12, 20, 27>
<1, 12, 10, 4>
<1, 12, 10, 22>
<1, 12, 0, 5>
<1, 12, 0, 9>
<1, 12, 0, 13>
<1, 25, 23, 19>
<1, 25, 29, 20>
<2, 5, 23, 19>
<2, 5, 23, 25>
<2, 5, 23, 22>
<2, 5, 28, 21>
<2, 5, 28, 21, 17>
<2, 5, 28, 21, 13>
<2, 5, 28, 21, 13, 18>
<2, 5, 28, 1>
<2, 5, 28, 1, 12>
<2, 14, 7, 9>
<2, 14, 7, 9, 16>
<2, 14, 7, 9, 0>
<2, 14, 28, 21>
<2, 14, 28, 21, 17>
<2, 14, 28, 21, 13>
<2, 14, 28, 21, 13, 18>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<0, 5, 23, 19> (Chord: (5, 23))
<0, 13, 21, 28> (Chord: (13, 21))
<0, 12, 20, 27> (Chord: (12, 20))
<0, 9, 16, 19> (Chord: (9, 16))
<1, 12, 10, 4> (Chord: (12, 10))
<1, 25, 29, 20> (Chord: (25, 29))
<2, 5, 23, 19> (Chord: (5, 23))
<2, 14, 7, 9> (Chord: (14, 7))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

[7]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are: 
<0, 5, 23, 19>, <0, 13, 21, 28>, <0, 12, 20, 27>, <0, 9, 16, 19>, <1, 12, 10, 4>, <1, 25, 29, 20>, <2, 14, 7, 9>
