Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 10) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 14) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 14) (6, 12) (6, 13) (7, 12) (7, 14) (7, 13) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 7) (12, 13) (0, 9) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 8) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 0) (14, 1) (14, 10) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 11) (11, 2) (11, 1) (11, 13) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 11) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 12) (13, 0) (13, 11) (10, 4) (10, 14)

Node 13 is connected to node 6, 7, 12, 0, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 8, 6, 7, 0, 1, and node 10

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2: 
- Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Step 3: 
- The number of chordless cycles found is 0, so the count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
