Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <4, 14, 15, 19>.

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 17, 3, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 1, 14, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 14, 15, 19, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 17, 3, 0, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 1, 14, 15, 7)
- Cycle 6: (7, 4, 17, 3, 7)
- Cycle 7: (8, 5, 9, 13, 8)
- Cycle 8: (9, 11, 3, 10, 9)
- Cycle 9: (11, 3, 0, 2, 11)
- Cycle 10: (11, 3, 17, 4, 11)
- Cycle 11: (14, 1, 7, 17, 14)
- Cycle 12: (14, 15, 10, 19, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: No chord exists.
- Cycle 2: No chord exists.
- Cycle 3: The chord (15, 19) connects non-adjacent nodes 15 and 19.
- Cycle 4: No chord exists.
- Cycle 5: No chord exists.
- Cycle 6: No chord exists.
- Cycle 7: No chord exists.
- Cycle 8: No chord exists.
- Cycle 9: No chord exists.
- Cycle 10: No chord exists.
- Cycle 11: No chord exists.
- Cycle 12: No chord exists.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, there is one unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
