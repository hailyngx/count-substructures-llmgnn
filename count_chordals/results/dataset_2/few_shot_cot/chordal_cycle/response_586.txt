Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
1. <0, 17, 5, 2, 0> (chordless cycle)
2. <0, 17, 5, 2, 10, 11, 7, 11, 2, 0> (chordless cycle)
3. <0, 17, 3, 9, 16, 6, 19, 8, 14, 3, 0> (chordless cycle)
4. <0, 18, 6, 16, 10, 12, 1, 13, 15, 7, 11, 2, 0> (chordless cycle)
  
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 17, 5, 2, 0> has chord (2, 10)
- <0, 17, 5, 2, 10, 11, 7, 11, 2, 0> has chord (10, 12)
- <0, 17, 3, 9, 16, 6, 19, 8, 14, 3, 0> has chord (3, 19)
- <0, 18, 6, 16, 10, 12, 1, 13, 15, 7, 11, 2, 0> has chord (10, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordal 4-cycles in this graph, so the final count is [0].
