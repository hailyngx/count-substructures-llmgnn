Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: <5, 4, 1, 7>
        - Cycle 2: <5, 8, 6, 7>
        - Cycle 3: <5, 10, 0, 2>
        - Cycle 4: <5, 4, 13, 3>
        - Cycle 5: <4, 1, 7, 6>
        - Cycle 6: <4, 13, 10, 7>
        - Cycle 7: <1, 7, 6, 9>
        - Cycle 8: <6, 7, 2, 14>
        - Cycle 9: <6, 2, 3, 0>
        - Cycle 10: <2, 14, 13, 4>
        - Cycle 11: <2, 7, 14, 12>
        - Cycle 12: <2, 8, 6, 9>
        - Cycle 13: <2, 8, 0, 3>
        - Cycle 14: <2, 8, 12, 10>
        - Cycle 15: <3, 0, 2, 6>
        - Cycle 16: <3, 13, 4, 1>
        - Cycle 17: <7, 6, 9, 12>
        - Cycle 18: <7, 10, 13, 4>
        - Cycle 19: <10, 0, 2, 8>
        - Cycle 20: <10, 7, 6, 9>
        - Cycle 21: <12, 8, 5, 4>
        - Cycle 22: <12, 9, 6, 7>
        - Cycle 23: <12, 14, 2, 8>
        - Cycle 24: <12, 10, 13, 14>
        - Cycle 25: <13, 4, 5, 8>
        - Cycle 26: <13, 10, 7, 6>
        - Cycle 27: <14, 2, 8, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycles found:
            <5, 4, 1, 7>
            <5, 10, 0, 2>
            <5, 4, 13, 3>
            <2, 14, 13, 4>
            <7, 6, 9, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        [22]
