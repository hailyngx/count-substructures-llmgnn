Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <5, 9, 13, 0, 5> (5-9-13-0-5)
- <5, 9, 13, 14, 5> (5-9-13-14-5)
- <5, 11, 12, 2, 5> (5-11-12-2-5)
- <9, 5, 11, 12, 9> (9-5-11-12-9)
- <9, 7, 3, 1, 9> (9-7-3-1-9)
- <9, 13, 14, 6, 9> (9-13-14-6-9)
- <6, 14, 13, 9, 6> (6-14-13-9-6)
- <1, 14, 13, 9, 1> (1-14-13-9-1)
- <1, 8, 2, 5, 1> (1-8-2-5-1)
- <3, 7, 9, 5, 3> (3-7-9-5-3)
- <3, 14, 13, 9, 3> (3-14-13-9-3)
- <3, 10, 4, 6, 3> (3-10-4-6-3)
- <8, 1, 3, 7, 8> (8-1-3-7-8)
- <13, 9, 5, 11, 13> (13-9-5-11-13)
- <13, 10, 4, 0, 13> (13-10-4-0-13)
- <7, 9, 5, 11, 7> (7-9-5-11-7)
- <12, 2, 8, 1, 12> (12-2-8-1-12)
- <2, 5, 11, 4, 2> (2-5-11-4-2)
- <0, 4, 6, 12, 0> (0-4-6-12-0)
- <14, 6, 4, 0, 14> (14-6-4-0-14)
- <10, 3, 1, 8, 10> (10-3-1-8-10)

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <5, 9, 13, (0, 5), 9> (5-9-13-(0,5)-9)
- <5, 9, 13, (14, 5), 9> (5-9-13-(14,5)-9)
- <5, 11, 12, (2, 5), 11> (5-11-12-(2,5)-11)
- <9, 13, 14, (6, 9), 13> (9-13-14-(6,9)-13)
- <6, 14, 13, (9, 6), 14> (6-14-13-(9,6)-14)
- <2, 5, 11, (4, 2), 5> (2-5-11-(4,2)-5)
- <3, 14, 13, (9, 3), 14> (3-14-13-(9,3)-14)

Step 3:
There are [7] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
