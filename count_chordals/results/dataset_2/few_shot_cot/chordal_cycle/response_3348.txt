Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 4, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 1, 3, 9, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 2, 6, 9, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 6, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 5: <1, 3, 6, 5, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 8, 9, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 2, 6, 5, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 2, 8, 9, 1>
- Cycle 9: <3, 6, 2, 5, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 6, 8, 9, 3>
- Cycle 11: <6, 2, 5, 9, 6>
- Cycle 12: <6, 2, 8, 3, 6>
- Cycle 13: <2, 5, 9, 8, 2>
- Cycle 14: <2, 5, 6, 3, 2>
- Cycle 15: <5, 6, 8, 7, 5>
- Cycle 16: <5, 9, 8, 7, 5>
- Cycle 17: <5, 2, 0, 7, 5>
- Cycle 18: <2, 0, 7, 8, 2>
- Cycle 19: <0, 7, 8, 3, 0>
- Cycle 20: <7, 8, 9, 5, 7>
- Cycle 21: <7, 8, 3, 6, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycle 1: <5, 1, 4, 5> (Chord: (1, 4))
- Chordal cycle 2: <5, 1, 3, 9, 5> (Chord: (1, 9))
- Chordal cycle 3: <5, 2, 6, 9, 5> (Chord: (2, 6))
- Chordal cycle 4: <5, 6, 9, 8, 5> (Chord: (6, 8))
- Chordal cycle 5: <1, 3, 6, 5, 1> (Chord: (3, 6))
- Chordal cycle 6: <3, 6, 8, 9, 3> (Chord: (6, 8))
- Chordal cycle 7: <0, 2, 5, 6, 0> (Chord: (2, 5))
- Chordal cycle 8: <0, 2, 8, 3, 0> (Chord: (2, 8))
- Chordal cycle 9: <5, 6, 8, 7, 5> (Chord: (6, 8))
- Chordal cycle 10: <7, 8, 9, 5, 7> (Chord: (8, 9))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found: [10]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<5, 1, 4, 5>, <5, 1, 3, 9, 5>, <5, 2, 6, 9, 5>, <5, 6, 9, 8, 5>, <1, 3, 6, 5, 1>, <3, 6, 8, 9, 3>, <0, 2, 5, 6, 0>, <0, 2, 8, 3, 0>, <5, 6, 8, 7, 5>, <7, 8, 9, 5, 7>
