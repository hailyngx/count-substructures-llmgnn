Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 19) (16, 1) (16, 9) (16, 15) (5, 9) (5, 17) (5, 7) (9, 16) (9, 5) (9, 2) (14, 7) (14, 13) (14, 10) (17, 5) (17, 4) (6, 2) (6, 13) (4, 17) (4, 18) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 2) (18, 4) (18, 7) (18, 3) (18, 8) (10, 14) (10, 0) (10, 1) (15, 16) (15, 0) (15, 12) (12, 4) (12, 15) (12, 0) (0, 10) (0, 15) (0, 12) (0, 3) (3, 18) (3, 0) (3, 8) (19, 11) (19, 7) (8, 18) (8, 3) (1, 16) (1, 10) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (13, 14) (13, 6) (13, 4) (13, 7) (7, 5) (7, 14) (7, 18) (7, 19) (7, 13)

Response:
Step 1: 
There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the graph.

Step 2:
Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, there are no chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Step 3:
Since there are no chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [0].
