Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle <0, 1, 4, 6> with edges (0, 1), (1, 4), (4, 6), (6, 0)
- Cycle <0, 4, 7, 3> with edges (0, 4), (4, 7), (7, 3), (3, 0)
- Cycle <0, 4, 6, 5> with edges (0, 4), (4, 6), (6, 5), (5, 0)
- Cycle <0, 6, 5, 9> with edges (0, 6), (6, 5), (5, 9), (9, 0)
- Cycle <0, 8, 5, 9> with edges (0, 8), (8, 5), (5, 9), (9, 0)
- Cycle <1, 4, 7, 2> with edges (1, 4), (4, 7), (7, 2), (2, 1)
- Cycle <1, 4, 6, 5> with edges (1, 4), (4, 6), (6, 5), (5, 1)
- Cycle <1, 9, 3, 7> with edges (1, 9), (9, 3), (3, 7), (7, 1)
- Cycle <2, 3, 7, 8> with edges (2, 3), (3, 7), (7, 8), (8, 2)
- Cycle <3, 6, 4, 7> with edges (3, 6), (6, 4), (4, 7), (7, 3)
- Cycle <5, 6, 0, 8> with edges (5, 6), (6, 0), (0, 8), (8, 5)
- Cycle <5, 8, 7, 4> with edges (5, 8), (8, 7), (7, 4), (4, 5)
- Cycle <5, 9, 3, 7> with edges (5, 9), (9, 3), (3, 7), (7, 5)
- Cycle <8, 2, 7, 4> with edges (8, 2), (2, 7), (7, 4), (4, 8)
- Cycle <8, 5, 9, 1> with edges (8, 5), (5, 9), (9, 1), (1, 8)
- Cycle <9, 1, 4, 7> with edges (9, 1), (1, 4), (4, 7), (7, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 1, 4, 6> has chord (1, 6)
- <1, 9, 3, 7> has chord (9, 7)
- <2, 3, 7, 8> has chord (3, 8)
- <5, 9, 3, 7> has chord (9, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [12]
