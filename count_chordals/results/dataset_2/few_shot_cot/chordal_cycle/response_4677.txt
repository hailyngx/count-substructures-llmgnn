Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 4, 10, 9> - Cycle of length 4
<0, 4, 1, 9> - Cycle of length 4
<0, 5, 3, 11> - Cycle of length 4
<0, 5, 8, 9> - Cycle of length 4
<0, 11, 3, 5> - Cycle of length 4
<0, 11, 8, 9> - Cycle of length 4
...

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 4, 10, 9, (1, 5)>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 4, 1, 9, (5, 12)>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 5, 3, 11, (8, 14)>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 5, 8, 9, (3, 11)>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 11, 3, 5, (8, 14)>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 11, 8, 9, (5, 3)>
...

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
