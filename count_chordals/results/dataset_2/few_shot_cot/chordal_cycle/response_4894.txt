Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0)

Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle: 0-5-9-3-0
- Cycle: 0-5-2-1-4-0
- Cycle: 0-5-8-2-1-9-0
- Cycle: 0-5-8-7-6-1-4-0
- Cycle: 1-9-5-8-7-6-1
- Cycle: 1-9-5-8-2-1
- Cycle: 2-5-8-7-6-2
- Cycle: 3-5-9-1-4-3
- Cycle: 4-0-5-9-1-4
- Cycle: 6-4-0-5-8-6
- Cycle: 7-0-5-9-1-7

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (5, 9), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (5, 2), 1, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (5, 8), 2, 1, 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (5, 8), 7, 6, 1, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (9, 5), 8, 7, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (9, 5), 8, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (5, 8), 7, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (5, 9), 1, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (0, 5), 9, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (4, 0), 5, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <7, (0, 5), 9, 1>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is the total number of cycles minus the number of chordal 4-cycles, which is 11 - 11 = 0.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [11].
