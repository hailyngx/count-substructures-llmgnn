Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Possible cycles in the graph are:
1. <0, 4, 1, 9>
2. <0, 4, 3, 9>
3. <0, 8, 6, 5>
4. <0, 8, 6, 7>
5. <1, 7, 6, 3>
6. <1, 7, 6, 5>
7. <1, 9, 2, 8>
8. <1, 9, 2, 0>
9. <2, 8, 6, 7>
10. <3, 6, 5, 8>

Step 2:
In the list, the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <1, 9, 2, 8> with chord (1, 8)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

Finally, the unique chordal 4-cycle is: <1, 9, 2, 8>
