Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. <0, 4, 10, 15>
2. <0, 4, 10, 7>
3. <1, 6, 16, 18>
4. <1, 6, 11, 15>
5. <1, 6, 11, 8>
6. <1, 8, 17, 5>
7. <1, 8, 17, 12>
8. <2, 14, 7, 18>
9. <3, 9, 11, 12>
10. <3, 9, 11, 15>
11. <3, 9, 13, 1>
12. <3, 9, 14, 7>
13. <5, 7, 18, 16>
14. <5, 7, 18, 15>
15. <5, 17, 12, 19>
16. <5, 17, 12, 11>
17. <7, 15, 11, 6>
18. <7, 15, 11, 12>
19. <8, 11, 15, 5>
20. <9, 13, 1, 6>
21. <9, 13, 1, 8>
22. <10, 0, 4, 19>
23. <10, 0, 4, 10>
24. <10, 7, 15, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <3, 9, 11, 12> (Chord: (9, 12))
2. <3, 9, 11, 15> (Chord: (9, 15))
3. <10, 0, 4, 19> (Chord: (0, 19))
4. <5, 17, 12, 19> (Chord: (17, 19))
5. <7, 15, 11, 12> (Chord: (15, 12))
6. <14, 9, 11, 15> (Chord: (9, 15))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
