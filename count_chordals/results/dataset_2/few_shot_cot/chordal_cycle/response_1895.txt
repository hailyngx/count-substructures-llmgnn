Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4:
- <3, 14, 17, 0>
- <3, 14, 18, 0>
- <3, 14, 0, 8>
- <3, 14, 0, 1>
- <3, 14, 18, 0>
- <3, 14, 0, 9>
- <14, 17, 0, 8>
- <14, 17, 0, 1>
- <14, 17, 0, 9>
- <17, 0, 18, 14>
- <17, 0, 8, 4>
- <17, 0, 1, 11>
- <0, 14, 3, 6>
- <0, 14, 17, 18>
- <0, 14, 18, 0>
- <0, 14, 18, 0>
- <0, 14, 18, 0>

Step 2:
- <3, 14, 17, 0> has one chord: (14, 0)
- <3, 14, 18, 0> has one chord: (14, 18)
- <3, 14, 0, 8> has one chord: (14, 0)
- <3, 14, 0, 1> has one chord: (14, 0)
- <3, 14, 0, 9> has one chord: (14, 0)
- <14, 17, 0, 8> has one chord: (14, 0)
- <14, 17, 0, 1> has one chord: (14, 0)
- <14, 17, 0, 9> has one chord: (17, 9)
- <17, 0, 8, 4> has one chord: (0, 8)

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the given graph, so the answer is [9].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <3, 14, 17, 0> with chord (14, 0)
- <3, 14, 18, 0> with chord (14, 18)
- <3, 14, 0, 8> with chord (14, 0)
- <3, 14, 0, 1> with chord (14, 0)
- <3, 14, 0, 9> with chord (14, 0)
- <14, 17, 0, 8> with chord (14, 0)
- <14, 17, 0, 1> with chord (14, 0)
- <14, 17, 0, 9> with chord (17, 9)
- <17, 0, 8, 4> with chord (0, 8)
