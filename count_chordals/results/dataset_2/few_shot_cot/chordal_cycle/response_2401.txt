Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 9, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 6, 2, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 8, 17, 14, 13, 4, 12, 7, 15, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 6, 0, 5, 18, 2)
- Cycle 5: (3, 9, 5, 18, 2, 6, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 9, 5, 0, 6, 2, 18, 3)
- Cycle 7: (4, 11, 2, 18, 5, 9, 3, 13, 4)
- Cycle 8: (12, 4, 13, 14, 17, 8, 6, 3, 1, 15, 12)
- Cycle 9: (15, 7, 12, 4, 13, 14, 17, 15)
- Cycle 10: (16, 7, 12, 4, 13, 3, 8, 17, 15,16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 9, 5, 1> - Chords: (3, 9)
- <1, 3, 6, 2, 1> - Chords: (3, 6)
- <1, 8, 17, 13, 14, 3, 6, 2, 1> - Chords: (8, 13)
- <2, 6, 0, 5, 18, 2> - Chords: (6, 5)
- <3, 9, 5, 18, 2, 6, 3> - Chords: (9, 18)
- <4, 11, 2, 18, 5, 9, 3, 13, 4> - Chords: (11, 5)
- <12, 4, 13, 14, 17, 8, 6, 3, 1, 15, 12> - Chords: (4, 8)
- <15, 7, 12, 4, 13, 14, 17, 15> - Chords: (7, 12)
- <16, 7, 12, 4, 13, 3, 8, 17, 15, 16> - Chords: (7, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [9]
