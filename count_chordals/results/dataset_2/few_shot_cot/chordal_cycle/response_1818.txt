Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 2, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 9, 8, 4, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 9, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 3, 4, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 4, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 4, 8, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 5, 8, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 5, 8, 4, 3, 1)
- Cycle 10: (2, 3, 1, 6, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 3, 4, 8, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 5, 8, 4, 3, 2)
- Cycle 13: (3, 4, 8, 5, 1, 3)
- Cycle 14: (4, 0, 1, 6, 9, 8, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 0, 1, 5, 8, 4)
- Cycle 16: (5, 1, 6, 9, 8, 5)
- Cycle 17: (5, 1, 4, 8, 5)
- Cycle 18: (5, 2, 8, 4, 3, 5)
- Cycle 19: (8, 9, 6, 1, 4, 8)

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 4 has chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 5 has chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 6 has chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 7 has chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 8 has chord (1, 6)
- Cycle 9 has chord (1, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <Cycle 4, (1, 6)>
- <Cycle 5, (1, 3)>
- <Cycle 6, (1, 4)>
- <Cycle 7, (1, 8)>
- <Cycle 8, (1, 6)>
- <Cycle 9, (1, 8)>
