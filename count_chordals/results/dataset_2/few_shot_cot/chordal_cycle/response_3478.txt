Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 16, 3, 18> with chord (0, 18)
2. <0, 16, 2, 3> with chord (16, 3)
3. <0, 16, 12, 14> with chord (16, 14)
4. <0, 16, 2, 19> with chord (16, 19)
5. <1, 4, 9, 0> with chord (1, 9)
6. <1, 4, 13, 12> with chord (4, 12)
7. <1, 4, 13, 2> with chord (4, 13)
8. <1, 4, 18, 6> with chord (4, 6)
9. <2, 3, 11, 17> with chord (3, 17)
10. <2, 3, 16, 12> with chord (3, 16)
11. <2, 3, 18, 4> with chord (3, 18)
12. <2, 19, 10, 7> with chord (19, 7)
13. <3, 11, 17, 14> with chord (11, 14)
14. <3, 11, 5, 7> with chord (11, 7)
15. <3, 16, 12, 13> with chord (16, 13)
16. <4, 18, 7, 10> with chord (18, 10)
17. <5, 7, 18, 4> with chord (7, 4)
18. <5, 7, 10, 19> with chord (7, 19)
19. <8, 1, 4, 13> with chord (1, 13)
20. <8, 1, 4, 18> with chord (1, 18)
21. <11, 17, 15, 8> with chord (17, 8)
22. <12, 14, 17, 15> with chord (14, 15)
23. <13, 12, 0, 9> with chord (12, 9)
24. <13, 12, 16, 2> with chord (12, 2)

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 16, 3, 18, (0, 18)>
2. <0, 16, 2, 19, (16, 19)>
3. <1, 4, 9, 0, (1, 9)>
4. <1, 4, 13, 12, (4, 12)>
5. <1, 4, 13, 2, (4, 13)>
6. <2, 3, 11, 17, (3, 17)>
7. <3, 11, 5, 7, (11, 7)>
8. <4, 18, 7, 10, (18, 10)>
9. <5, 7, 18, 4, (7, 4)>
10. <8, 1, 4, 13, (1, 13)>
11. <11, 17, 15, 8, (17, 8)>
12. <12, 14, 17, 15, (14, 15)>
13. <13, 12, 0, 9, (12, 9)>
14. <13, 12, 16, 2, (12, 2)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found gives [14].
