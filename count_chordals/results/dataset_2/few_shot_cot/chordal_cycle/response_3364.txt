Response:
Based on the given graph, we can identify the chordless 4-cycles as follows:

1. <0, 3, 6, 1>
2. <0, 3, 1, 12>
3. <0, 5, 19, 8>
4. <0, 5, 17, 12>
5. <0, 5, 19, 10>
6. <0, 14, 8, 13>
7. <0, 14, 8, 19>
8. <1, 3, 0, 5>
9. <1, 3, 6, 11>
10. <1, 12, 16, 11>
11. <2, 7, 11, 16>
12. <2, 7, 11, 6>
13. <2, 13, 8, 14>
14. <2, 13, 8, 19>
15. <4, 0, 5, 19>
16. <4, 0, 3, 1>
17. <4, 15, 9, 8>
18. <5, 0, 14, 8>
19. <6, 3, 1, 12>
20. <6, 3, 0, 5>
21. <7, 2, 13, 8>
22. <7, 11, 16, 12>
23. <8, 14, 0, 4>
24. <8, 14, 0, 5>
25. <8, 19, 10, 18>
26. <10, 19, 5, 17>
27. <11, 16, 12, 17>
28. <13, 8, 19, 10>
29. <17, 5, 0, 14>
30. <17, 12, 16, 11>

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [30].
