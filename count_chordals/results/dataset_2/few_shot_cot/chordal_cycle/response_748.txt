Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles of length 4: (0, 5, 3, 8), (0, 5, 2, 6), (0, 5, 4, 7), (4, 5, 3, 8), (4, 5, 7, 0), (4, 9, 1, 8), (7, 4, 6, 0), (7, 4, 9, 1), (7, 9, 1, 8), (9, 5, 2, 0)
- No cycle of length 5 or more

Step 2:
- Checking for chords in each cycle:
    - (0, 5, 3, 8) has a chord: (5, 8)
    - (0, 5, 2, 6) has a chord: (5, 6)
    - (0, 5, 4, 7) has a chord: (5, 7)
    - (4, 5, 3, 8) has a chord: (4, 8)
    - (4, 5, 7, 0) has a chord: (4, 7)
    - (4, 9, 1, 8) has no chord
    - (7, 4, 6, 0) has no chord
    - (7, 4, 9, 1) has no chord
    - (7, 9, 1, 8) has no chord
    - (9, 5, 2, 0) has no chord

Step 3:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 5, 3, 8> (Chord: (5, 8))
- <0, 5, 2, 6> (Chord: (5, 6))
- <0, 5, 4, 7> (Chord: (5, 7))
