Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 12, 3, 5>
- Cycle 2: <1, 6, 4, 3, 12>
- Cycle 3: <1, 10, 4, 3, 12>
- Cycle 4: <1, 10, 4, 2, 11>
- Cycle 5: <1, 10, 8, 7, 5>
- Cycle 6: <1, 10, 8, 7, 13>
- Cycle 7: <1, 10, 8, 2, 11>
- Cycle 8: <1, 14, 12, 3, 5>
- Cycle 9: <2, 11, 5, 7, 8>
- Cycle 10: <2, 11, 13, 9, 12>
- Cycle 11: <3, 5, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle 12: <3, 4, 6, 1, 10>
- Cycle 13: <3, 4, 10, 8, 7>
- Cycle 14: <3, 12, 9, 13, 7>
- Cycle 15: <4, 6, 9, 13, 7>
- Cycle 16: <4, 10, 8, 7, 13>
- Cycle 17: <5, 7, 8, 9, 6>
- Cycle 18: <5, 7, 11, 13, 9>
- Cycle 19: <6, 9, 13, 7, 5>
- Cycle 20: <8, 10, 1, 13, 7>
- Cycle 21: <9, 6, 1, 14, 12>
- Cycle 22: <9, 6, 4, 12, 14>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (3, 12)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (4, 12)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (4, 11)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (8, 10)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (9, 11)
- Cycle 14 has 1 chord: (9, 13)
- Cycle 15 has 1 chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 17 has 1 chord: (8, 9)
- Cycle 18 has 1 chord: (9, 13)
- Cycle 19 has 1 chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 20 has 1 chord: (1, 13)
- Cycle 21 has 1 chord: (1, 14)
- Cycle 22 has 1 chord: (6, 14)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 15
Therefore, the final answer is [15].
