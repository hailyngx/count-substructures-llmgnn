Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 1) (10, 5) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 7) (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 4) (7, 10) (7, 11) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (12, 5) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 6) (2, 7) (2, 12) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 10) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 13) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 0) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 6) (0, 13)

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are 5 cycles of length 4 in the graph: (5, 12, 7, 2), (5, 3, 14, 9), (5, 3, 8, 1), (5, 10, 11, 14), (7, 3, 6, 12).

Step 2: 
- Out of the 5 cycles identified in Step 1, only 2 cycles have exactly one chord: (5, 12, 7, 2) and (5, 10, 11, 14). 

Step 3: 
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, 12, 7, 2>
- <5, 10, 11, 14>
