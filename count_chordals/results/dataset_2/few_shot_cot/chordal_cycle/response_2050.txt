Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 10, 4, 8>
- <0, 10, 1, 13>
- <1, 13, 11, 6>
- <2, 6, 11, 7>
- <5, 7, 9, 0>
- <5, 7, 8, 13>
- <5, 7, 12, 13>
- <5, 7, 12, 2>
- <5, 9, 7, 8>
- <5, 13, 1, 3>
- <5, 13, 6, 11>
- <5, 13, 8, 4>
- <5, 14, 0, 10>
- <5, 14, 0, 1>
- <6, 2, 0, 10>
- <6, 2, 12, 13>
- <7, 5, 14, 0>
- <7, 8, 4, 10>
- <8, 3, 1, 13>
- <8, 3, 11, 6>
- <8, 4, 10, 0>
- <9, 5, 13, 1>
- <11, 7, 12, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 0, 10, 4, 8> has one chord: (0, 10)
- <5, 13, 1, 10, 0, 14> has one chord: (1, 13)
- <1, 13, 5, 7, 12, 6> has one chord: (1, 13)
- <2, 6, 11, 7, 5, 14> has one chord: (6, 11)
- <5, 7, 9, 0, 14, 13> has one chord: (9, 0)
- <5, 7, 8, 13, 12, 2> has one chord: (8, 13)
- <5, 7, 12, 13, 6, 11> has one chord: (6, 11)
- <5, 7, 12, 2, 0, 10> has one chord: (0, 10)
- <5, 9, 7, 8, 4, 10> has one chord: (8, 4)
- <5, 13, 1, 3, 11, 6> has one chord: (3, 11)
- <5, 13, 6, 11, 7, 12> has one chord: (6, 11)
- <5, 13, 8, 4, 10, 0> has one chord: (8, 4)
- <5, 14, 0, 1, 13, 11> has one chord: (1, 13)
- <6, 2, 0, 10, 4, 8> has one chord: (2, 8)
- <6, 2, 12, 13, 5, 7> has one chord: (7, 5)
- <7, 5, 14, 0, 10, 1> has one chord: (1, 10)
- <7, 8, 4, 10, 0, 14> has one chord: (10, 0)
- <8, 3, 1, 13, 5, 7> has one chord: (3, 1)
- <8, 3, 11, 6, 2, 12> has one chord: (6, 11)
- <8, 4, 10, 0, 14, 5> has one chord: (10, 0)
- <9, 5, 13, 1, 3, 11> has one chord: (1, 3)
- <11, 7, 5, 14, 0, 10> has one chord: (5, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<5, 9, 0, 10, (4, 8)>
