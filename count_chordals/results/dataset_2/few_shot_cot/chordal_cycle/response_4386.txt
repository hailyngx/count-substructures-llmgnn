Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles in the graph, but only the chordal 4-cycles need to be considered. Here are the chordal 4-cycles found: 

<0, 1, 6, 7> 
<0, 1, 9, 5>
<0, 4, 6, 7>
<0, 4, 5, 9>
<1, 6, 3, 8>
<1, 7, 5, 9>
<2, 5, 9, 8>
<2, 8, 3, 5>
<3, 5, 7, 6>
<4, 0, 6, 1>
<4, 0, 9, 5>
<4, 6, 3, 8>
<5, 7, 1, 9>
<5, 9, 2, 8>
<6, 1, 9, 5>

Step 2:
Among the above cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are the following: 

<0, 1, 6, 7> : Chord (1, 6)
<0, 1, 9, 5> : Chord (1, 9)
<0, 4, 6, 7> : Chord (4, 6)
<0, 4, 5, 9> : Chord (4, 5)
<1, 6, 3, 8> : Chord (6, 3)
<1, 7, 5, 9> : Chord (7, 5)
<2, 5, 9, 8> : Chord (5, 9)
<2, 8, 3, 5> : Chord (8, 3)
<3, 5, 7, 6> : Chord (5, 7)
<4, 0, 6, 1> : Chord (0, 6)
<4, 0, 9, 5> : Chord (0, 9)
<4, 6, 3, 8> : Chord (6, 3)
<5, 7, 1, 9> : Chord (7, 1)
<5, 9, 2, 8> : Chord (9, 2)
<6, 1, 9, 5> : Chord (1, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we get a total of [15].
