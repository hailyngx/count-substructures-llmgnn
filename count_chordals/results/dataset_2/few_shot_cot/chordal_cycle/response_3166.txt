14. <1, 3, 7, 4, 5>
15. <1, 3, 7, 4, 8>
16. <1, 3, 7, 13, 8>
17. <1, 3, 7, 13, 5>
18. <1, 6, 12, 9, 14>
19. <1, 6, 12, 3, 7>
20. <1, 10, 5, 4, 13>
21. <1, 10, 5, 13, 8>
22. <1, 11, 9, 14, 10>
23. <1, 11, 9, 12, 6>
24. <1, 11, 4, 5, 13>
25. <1, 11, 4, 13, 8>
26. <1, 11, 2, 13, 8>
27. <2, 11, 9, 14, 10>
28. <2, 11, 4, 5, 13>
29. <2, 13, 5, 10, 14>
30. <2, 13, 8, 7, 3>
31. <3, 6, 12, 9, 11>
32. <3, 6, 12, 0, 14>
33. <3, 6, 12, 9, 11>
34. <3, 6, 1, 10, 14>

37. <4, 5, 10, 14, 9>
38. <4, 7, 3, 6, 12>
39. <4, 7, 3, 13, 8>
40. <4, 8, 13, 2, 11>
41. <5, 10, 14, 9, 11>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are as follows:
1. <0, 14, 10, 5, 13>
2. <1, 3, 7, 4, 5>
3. <1, 3, 7, 4, 8>
4. <1, 6, 12, 9, 14>
5. <1, 10, 5, 4, 13>
6. <1, 11, 9, 14, 10>
7. <2, 11, 4, 5, 13>
8. <2, 13, 5, 10, 14>
9. <3, 6, 12, 0, 14>
10. <3, 7, 13, 8, 4>
11. <4, 5, 10, 14, 9>

Step 3:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles in total, so the final count is [11].
