Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 4, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 2, 3, 8, 4, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <5, 6, 9, 8, 4, 3, 2, 5>
- Cycle 4: <6, 9, 8, 4, 1, 7, 6>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- In Cycle 1: <0, 5, 4, 1, 7, 0>, (4, 1) is a chord.
- In Cycle 2: <0, 5, 2, 3, 8, 4, 1, 7, 0>, (2, 8) is a chord.
- In Cycle 3: <5, 6, 9, 8, 4, 3, 2, 5>, (9, 8) is a chord.
- In Cycle 4: <6, 9, 8, 4, 1, 7, 6>, (9, 8) is a chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
As we found 0 chordless cycle, the final count is [0].
