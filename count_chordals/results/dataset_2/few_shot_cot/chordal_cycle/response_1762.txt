28. (12, 2, 0, 4, 13)
29. (12, 11, 1, 13, 4)

Step 2: Checking for chord in each cycle:
- Only the cycle (7, 1, 13, 4, 12) has exactly one chord (7, 12).
  
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 27 chordless 4-cycles.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <7, 1, 13, 4, 12> with a chord (7, 12).
