Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (5, 9, 2, 6) with chord (9, 6)
- (5, 1, 2, 6) with chord (1, 6)
- (5, 1, 7, 2) with chord (1, 7)
- (5, 1, 8, 7) with chord (1, 8)
- (5, 0, 3, 9) with chord (0, 9)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is [5].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<5, (9, 6)>
<1, (1, 6)>
<2, (1, 7)>
<3, (1, 8)>
<4, (0, 9)>
