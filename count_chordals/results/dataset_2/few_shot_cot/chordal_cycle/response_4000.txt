Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 7

Response:
Following the steps provided, let's find the chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 9, 5, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 7, 9, 5, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 8, 3, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 5, 9, 6, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 7, 4, 5, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 1, 4, 5, 3>
- Cycle 8: <4, 5, 2, 7, 4>
- Cycle 9: <5, 9, 6, 2, 5>
- Cycle 10: <7, 4, 5, 9, 7>
- Cycle 11: <8, 1, 4, 5, 8>
- Cycle 12: <8, 3, 1, 4, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- From the cycles above, only Cycle 3: <1, 4, 7, 9, 5, 1> has exactly one chord: (4, 9).

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
