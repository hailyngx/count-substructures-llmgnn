- <11, 16, 2, 3> has chord: (16, 2)
- <11, 16, 4, 19> has chord: (16, 4)
- <11, 5, 6, 14> has chord: (5, 14)
- <11, 5, 4, 19> has chord: (5, 4)
- <16, 1, 12, 13> has chord: (1, 13)
- <16, 2, 3, 15> has chord: (2, 15)
- <16, 4, 19, 0> has chord: (4, 0)
- <5, 4, 19, 0> has chord: (4, 19)
- <6, 14, 15, 12> has chord: (14, 15)
- <6, 14, 11, 16> has chord: (14, 11)
- <0, 12, 15, 6> has chord: (12, 6)
- <0, 12, 1, 16> has chord: (12, 1)
- <0, 12, 13, 7> has chord: (12, 13)
- <7, 13, 12, 1> has chord: (13, 1)
- <10, 6, 15, 12> has chord: (6, 15)
- <10, 6, 14, 15> has chord: (6, 14)
- <14, 11, 16, 1> has chord: (11, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [26].
