Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 16, 2, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 16, 18, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 16, 3, 1>
- Cycle 4: <0, 14, 9, 7>
- Cycle 5: <0, 14, 15, 17>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 16, 18>
- Cycle 7: <2, 7, 9, 14>
- Cycle 8: <2, 7, 11, 4>
- Cycle 9: <2, 11, 5, 12>
- Cycle 10: <3, 1, 18, 16>
- Cycle 11: <3, 16, 0, 14>
- Cycle 12: <4, 11, 5, 12>
- Cycle 13: <4, 11, 7, 2>
- Cycle 14: <5, 11, 7, 9>
- Cycle 15: <6, 10, 13, 17>
- Cycle 16: <8, 19, 16, 3>
- Cycle 17: <9, 7, 11, 5>
- Cycle 18: <9, 14, 15, 17>
- Cycle 19: <10, 6, 17, 15>
- Cycle 20: <10, 17, 4, 11>
- Cycle 21: <11, 5, 2, 16>
- Cycle 22: <12, 5, 2, 16>

- Cycle 33: <19, 8, 16, 0>
- Cycle 34: <19, 8, 16, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord
- <0, 16, 2, 7> has one chord: (0, 7)
- <0, 16, 18, 1> has one chord: (16, 18)
- <0, 16, 3, 1> has one chord: (16, 3)
- <0, 14, 9, 7> has one chord: (9, 14)
- <0, 14, 15, 17> has one chord: (14, 15)
- <6, 10, 13, 17> has one chord: (10, 13)
- <8, 19, 16, 3> has one chord: (16, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 27 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [27].
