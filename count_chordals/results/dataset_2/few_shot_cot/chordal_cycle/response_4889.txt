Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, 4, 19, 14>, with chord (1, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 43 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of all chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
