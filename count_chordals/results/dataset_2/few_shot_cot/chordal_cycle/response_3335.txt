Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 9) (2, 5) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
1. (4, 7, 1, 6, 4)
2. (4, 7, 2, 9, 4)
3. (4, 7, 8, 1, 4)
4. (4, 5, 6, 9, 4)
5. (4, 5, 2, 7, 4)
6. (4, 5, 3, 5, 4)
7. (5, 6, 1, 7, 5)
8. (5, 6, 0, 9, 5)
9. (5, 6, 1, 6, 5)
10. (5, 6, 0, 1, 5)
11. (5, 2, 9, 6, 5)
12. (5, 2, 7, 4, 5)
13. (5, 2, 4, 7, 5)
14. (5, 3, 4, 7, 5)
15. (2, 7, 1, 8, 2)
16. (2, 7, 4, 5, 2)
17. (2, 7, 8, 1, 2)
18. (2, 9, 1, 6, 2)
19. (2, 9, 4, 5, 2)
20. (2, 9, 1, 9, 2)
21. (8, 7, 1, 6, 8)
22. (8, 7, 4, 5, 8)
23. (8, 5, 6, 9, 8)
24. (8, 5, 2, 7, 8)
25. (1, 7, 4, 5, 1)
26. (1, 7, 8, 1, 1)
27. (1, 6, 5, 4, 1)
28. (1, 6, 9, 2, 1)
29. (1, 0, 5, 3, 1)
30. (1, 0, 6, 1, 1)
31. (3, 4, 5, 3, 3)
32. (0, 6, 5, 4, 0)
33. (0, 6, 9, 2, 0)
34. (0, 6, 1, 7, 0)
35. (0, 9, 6, 5, 0)
36. (0, 9, 2, 7, 0)
37. (0, 9, 1, 8, 0)
38. (0, 5, 4, 7, 0)
39. (0, 5, 3, 5, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordless cycles:
1. <1, (8, 5), 7>
2. <2, (9, 4), 7>
3. <3, (4, 7), 5>
4. <4, (5, 2), 7>
5. <5, (4, 7), 6>
6. <6, (1, 9), 5>
7. <7, (2, 8), 4>
8. <8, (1, 7), 6>
9. <9, (1, 6), 2>
10. <0, (6, 5), 9>

Final number of chordal 4-cycles: [10]
