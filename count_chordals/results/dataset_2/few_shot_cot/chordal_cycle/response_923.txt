Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <1, 4, 2, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 7, 8, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 4, 2, 5, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 2, 0, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 2, 3, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 8, 6, 5, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 9, 8, 6, 5, 2>
- Cycle 9: <3, 9, 4, 2, 1, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 9, 8, 6, 5, 2, 1, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 each have exactly one chord, while the other cycles do not have any chords.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 4, 9, 3> with a chord (4, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 4, 7, 8> with a chord (1, 8)
