Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 4, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 2>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 9, 2>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 5, 8>
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 2, 3>
- Cycle 7: <1, 9, 7, 4>
- Cycle 8: <1, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 9: <2, 9, 5, 8>
- Cycle 10: <2, 9, 7, 4>
- Cycle 11: <3, 4, 7, 1>
- Cycle 12: <3, 4, 0, 2>
- Cycle 13: <3, 6, 1, 9>
- Cycle 14: <3, 8, 5, 9>

Step 2: Identify chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 5, 4, 7> (Chord: (4, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 9> (Chord: (5, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 9, 7, 4> (Chord: (7, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, 9, 5, 8> (Chord: (5, 9))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 10 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
