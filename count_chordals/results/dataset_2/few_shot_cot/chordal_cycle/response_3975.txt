Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 7, 1, 6>
2. <0, 7, 9, 2>
3. <0, 7, 2, 1>
4. <0, 1, 2, 9>
5. <1, 6, 5, 4>
6. <1, 6, 3, 8>
7. <1, 7, 2, 9>
8. <1, 7, 0, 3>
9. <1, 2, 8, 5>
10. <2, 9, 7, 0>
11. <2, 9, 7, 1>
12. <2, 9, 7, 0>
13. <3, 6, 5, 8>
14. <3, 6, 1, 7>
15. <3, 0, 7, 1>
16. <4, 6, 5, 8>
17. <5, 6, 1, 8>
18. <5, 6, 3, 0>
19. <5, 4, 6, 1>
20. <6, 5, 8, 2>
21. <6, 1, 2, 8>
22. <7, 9, 2, 1>
23. <7, 9, 2, 0>
24. <8, 6, 1, 7>
25. <8, 6, 3, 0>

Step 2:
The chords in the cycles are:
1. <0, 7, 2, 1> have one chord (7, 1)
2. <1, 7, 2, 9> have one chord (7, 9)

Step 3:
As there are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [2].
