Response:
In this graph, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <0, 10, 13, 5>. 

Following the steps provided earlier, 
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. Potential cycles are (0, 10, 13, 5), (10, 13, 5, 2), and (13, 5, 2, 9).
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. Only the cycle (0, 10, 13, 5) has exactly one chord, which is the edge (10, 13), making it a chordal 4-cycle.
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which in this case is 1.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
