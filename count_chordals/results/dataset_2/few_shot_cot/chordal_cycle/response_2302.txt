Response:
The unique cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:

1. <3, 13, 1, 9>
2. <3, 13, 26, 21>
3. <3, 24, 10, 4>
4. <10, 5, 8, 9>
5. <10, 5, 8, 21>
6. <10, 24, 7, 16>
7. <10, 24, 21, 13>
8. <13, 1, 9, 27>
9. <16, 7, 24, 10>
10. <16, 12, 28, 3>
11. <19, 11, 27, 20>
12. <19, 16, 2, 21>
13. <19, 16, 7, 24>
14. <21, 8, 9, 1>
15. <21, 8, 9, 4>
16. <21, 13, 3, 24>
17. <21, 24, 3, 13>
18. <22, 20, 25, 23>
19. <22, 14, 9, 1>
20. <25, 0, 25, 22>
21. <25, 20, 6, 20>
22. <27, 20, 6, 20>
23. <27, 11, 19, 16>

The chordal 4-cycles found among these cycles are:

1. <3, 13, 1, 9> with chord (13, 9)
2. <3, 13, 26, 21> with chord (13, 21)
3. <10, 5, 8, 9> with chord (5, 9)
4. <10, 24, 7, 16> with chord (24, 16)
5. <13, 1, 9, 27> with chord (1, 27)
6. <21, 13, 3, 24> with chord (13, 24)
7. <22, 14, 9, 1> with chord (14, 1)

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [16].
