Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 11) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 0) (9, 12) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 7) (7, 9) (7, 13) (7, 12) (7, 1) (12, 9) (12, 7) (12, 2) (12, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 3) (2, 12) (2, 1) (2, 4) (11, 6) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 1) (14, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 11) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 10) (10, 1) (10, 3) (4, 13) (4, 2) (4, 14) (4, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 4)
