Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows: 
- <0, 11, 1, 4>
- <0, 4, 3, 12>
- <0, 4, 1, 11>
- <0, 4, 10, 3>
- <1, 4, 3, 10>
- <1, 4, 10, 12>
- <1, 4, 5, 2>
- <1, 2, 5, 4>
- <1, 2, 14, 7>
- <1, 2, 7, 11>
- <2, 5, 4, 3>
- <2, 5, 4, 10>
- <2, 5, 1, 11>
- <2, 5, 9, 13>
- <2, 4, 3, 10>
- <2, 4, 3, 12>
- <2, 4, 1, 11>
- <2, 4, 10, 12>
- <3, 4, 1, 11>
- <3, 4, 10, 12>
- <3, 4, 5, 2>
- <3, 10, 1, 11>
- <3, 10, 12, 14>
- <4, 5, 2, 1>
- <4, 10, 1, 11>
- <4, 10, 3, 12>
- <4, 10, 12, 14>
- <5, 4, 3, 10>
- <5, 4, 10, 12>
- <5, 2, 1, 11>
- <6, 12, 3, 10>
- <6, 12, 14, 7>
- <6, 12, 9, 13>
- <7, 11, 1, 4>
- <7, 11, 0, 4>
- <7, 11, 13, 9>
- <11, 1, 4, 0>
- <11, 1, 4, 10>
- <11, 1, 2, 5>
- <11, 1, 2, 14>
- <11, 1, 10, 3>
- <11, 1, 10, 12>
- <11, 14, 2, 7>
- <11, 14, 7, 2>
- <12, 6, 13, 9>
- <13, 5, 2, 1>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord in the given graph are:
- <1, 2, 5, 4, (3, 10)>
- <2, 5, 4, 3, (1, 11)>
- <3, 4, 1, 11, (10, 12)>
- <4, 5, 2, 1, (10, 3)>
- <6, 12, 3, 10, (9, 13)>

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [40].
