Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

        - Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 4>
        - Cycle 2: <0, 6, 5, 4>
        - Cycle 3: <0, 6, 5, 7>
        - Cycle 4: <0, 7, 5, 4>
        - Cycle 5: <0, 7, 9, 5>
        - Cycle 6: <0, 2, 4, 5>
        - Cycle 7: <0, 2, 4, 3>
        - Cycle 8: <0, 2, 3, 8>
        - Cycle 9: <0, 2, 9, 8>
        - Cycle 10: <1, 6, 5, 4>
        - Cycle 11: <2, 9, 8, 7>
        - Cycle 12: <3, 2, 4, 5>
        - Cycle 13: <3, 8, 9, 5>
        - Cycle 14: <4, 5, 7, 9>
        - Cycle 15: <4, 5, 9, 8>
        - Cycle 16: <4, 1, 6, 5>
        - Cycle 17: <4, 2, 7, 8>
        - Cycle 18: <5, 7, 9, 8>
        - Cycle 19: <5, 6, 1, 4>
        - Cycle 20: <5, 6, 0, 7>
        - Cycle 21: <6, 0, 2, 4>
        - Cycle 22: <6, 0, 7, 9>
        - Cycle 23: <6, 1, 4, 2>
        - Cycle 24: <7, 5, 4, 1>
        - Cycle 25: <7, 5, 9, 8>
        - Cycle 26: <7, 0, 2, 4>
        - Cycle 27: <7, 0, 6, 5>
        - Cycle 28: <8, 9, 5, 4>
        - Cycle 29: <9, 8, 7, 5>
        - Cycle 30: <9, 5, 4, 2>
        - Cycle 31: <9, 5, 6, 1>
        - Cycle 32: <9, 7, 0, 6>


Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord

        - Chordal 4-cycles:
            <1, 6, 5, 4, (1, 4)>
            <3, 2, 9, 5, (3, 9)>
            <0, 7, 5, 4, (0, 5)>
            <4, 5, 9, 8, (4, 9)>
            <2, 9, 8, 7, (2, 7)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        There are [0] chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
