Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <0, (3, 19), 10>. 

The process of counting chordless 4-cycles in the graph is as follows:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4:

- Cycle: 0 - 3 - 25 - 6 - 0
- Cycle: 0 - 19 - 9 - 6 - 0
- Cycle: 0 - 19 - 10 - 15 - 0
- Cycle: 1 - 28 - 6 - 25 - 1
- Cycle: 2 - 22 - 26 - 4 - 2
- Cycle: 3 - 25 - 21 - 27 - 3
- Cycle: 3 - 24 - 18 - 21 - 3
- Cycle: 5 - 12 - 4 - 7 - 5
- Cycle: 5 - 29 - 10 - 15 - 5
- Cycle: 7 - 16 - 27 - 21 - 7
- Cycle: 7 - 14 - 18 - 24 - 7
- Cycle: 11 - 13 - 7 - 4 - 11
- Cycle: 11 - 27 - 21 - 25 - 11
- Cycle: 14 - 18 - 20 - 27 - 14
- Cycle: 16 - 27 - 20 - 3 - 16
- Cycle: 17 - 24 - 18 - 14 - 17
- Cycle: 19 - 9 - 28 - 1 - 19
- Cycle: 22 - 26 - 12 - 28 - 22
- Cycle: 23 - 24 - 17 - 5 - 23
- Cycle: 25 - 3 - 0 - 19 - 25

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only the cycle <0, 3, 19, 10> has exactly one chord, which is (3, 19).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [19].
