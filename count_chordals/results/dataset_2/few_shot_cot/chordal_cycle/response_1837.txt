Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 18) (10, 1) (11, 10) (11, 5) (11, 2) (8, 10) (8, 7) (13, 12) (13, 15) (0, 14) (14, 0) (14, 16) (1, 10) (1, 6) (17, 6) (17, 18) (17, 7) (6, 10) (6, 1) (6, 17) (6, 15) (6, 4) (9, 16) (9, 12) (18, 10) (18, 17) (18, 3) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 15) (2, 4) (5, 11) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 16) (3, 18) (3, 5) (3, 12) (19, 2) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 15) (7, 8) (7, 17) (7, 15) (15, 13) (15, 6) (15, 2) (15, 4) (15, 7) (12, 13) (12, 9) (12, 3) (16, 14) (16, 9) (16, 5)

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <2, 11, 5, 16>. 

Since this cycle has only one chord (2, 5), the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
