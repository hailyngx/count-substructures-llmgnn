Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (0, 3, 5, 6) with edges (0, 3), (3, 5), and (5, 6)
- Cycle 2: (0, 3, 16, 9) with edges (0, 3), (3, 16), and (16, 9)
- Cycle 3: (0, 13, 4, 17) with edges (0, 13), (13, 4), and (4, 17)
- Cycle 4: (0, 19, 10, 4) with edges (0, 19), (19, 10), and (10, 4)
- Cycle 5: (1, 11, 19, 0) with edges (1, 11), (11, 19), and (19, 0)
- Cycle 6: (1, 13, 4, 17) with edges (4, 17), (13, 4), and (1, 13)
- Cycle 7: (2, 14, 4, 17) with edges (2, 14), (14, 4), and (4, 17)
- Cycle 8: (2, 3, 5, 6) with edges (2, 3), (3, 5), and (5, 6)
- Cycle 9: (3, 5, 7, 8) with edges (3, 5), (5, 7), and (7, 8)
- Cycle 10: (3, 16, 19, 0) with edges (3, 16), (16, 19), and (19, 0)
- Cycle 11: (4, 9, 15, 6) with edges (4, 9), (9, 15), and (15, 6)
- Cycle 12: (4, 9, 16, 3) with edges (3, 16), (9, 16), and (4, 9)
- Cycle 13: (4, 10, 19, 0) with edges (4, 10), (10, 19), and (19, 0)
- Cycle 14: (5, 6, 15, 8) with edges (5, 6), (6, 15), and (5, 8)
- Cycle 15: (5, 7, 8, 15) with edges (5, 7), (7, 8), and (8, 15)
- Cycle 16: (9, 12, 4, 17) with edges (9, 12), (12, 4), and (4, 17)

- Cycle 19: (10, 1, 13, 0) with edges (10, 1), (1, 13), and (10, 0)
- Cycle 20: (10, 4, 17, 6) with edges (10, 4), (17, 4), and (6, 17)
- Cycle 21: (11, 1, 13, 0) with edges (11, 1), (1, 13), and (11, 0)
- Cycle 22: (16, 3, 5, 6) with edges (16, 3), (3, 5), and (16, 6)
- Cycle 23: (16, 9, 18, 4) with edges (16, 9), (9, 18), and (18, 4)

- Cycle 25: (19, 11, 1, 13) with edges (19, 11), (11, 1), and (19, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal cycles:
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (13, 4), 17, 11)>
- Chordal cycle 2: <4, (9, 16), 3, 10)>
- Chordal cycle 3: <9, (12, 17), 4, 18)>
- Chordal cycle 4: <0, (19, 10), 4, 13)>
- Chordal cycle 5: <16, (3, 9), 4, 18)>
- Chordal cycle 6: <11, (1, 19), 0, 13)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [20] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
