Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 15), 3>: chord (4, 15)
- <2, (4, 15), 3>: chord (4, 15)
- <3, (4, 15), 10>: chord (4, 15)
- <4, (4, 15), 10>: chord (4, 15)
- <5, (4, 15), 10>: chord (4, 15)
- <6, (4, 15), 3>: chord (4, 15)
- <7, (4, 13), 6>: chord (4, 13)
- <8, (4, 13), 18>: chord (4, 13)
- <9, (4, 13), 18>: chord (4, 13)
- <10, (4, 13), 12>: chord (4, 13)
- <11, (4, 13), 12>: chord (4, 13)
- <12, (5, 11), 16>: chord (5, 11)
- <13, (5, 11), 16>: chord (5, 11)
- <14, (5, 11), 16>: chord (5, 11)
- <15, (5, 17), 10>: chord (5, 17)
- <16, (5, 17), 10>: chord (5, 17)
- <17, (9, 8), 16>: chord (9, 8)
- <18, (9, 8), 16>: chord (9, 8)
- <19, (9, 8), 16>: chord (9, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 19 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Putting this final number inside brackets: [19].
