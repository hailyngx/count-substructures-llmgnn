Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 2, 5>
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 6, 5>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 2, 9>
- Cycle 4: <1, 3, 9, 7>
- Cycle 5: <1, 3, 8, 6>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 8: <1, 4, 6, 3>
- Cycle 9: <1, 7, 8, 6>
- Cycle 10: <2, 1, 4, 6>
- Cycle 11: <2, 1, 3, 6>
- Cycle 12: <2, 1, 7, 8>
- Cycle 13: <2, 1, 3, 9>
- Cycle 14: <2, 9, 7, 6>
- Cycle 15: <2, 9, 3, 6>
- Cycle 16: <3, 9, 7, 6>
- Cycle 17: <3, 9, 2, 5>
- Cycle 18: <3, 1, 7, 8>
- Cycle 19: <4, 6, 3, 9>
- Cycle 20: <4, 6, 8, 7>
- Cycle 21: <4, 1, 7, 8>
- Cycle 22: <5, 2, 9, 7>
- Cycle 23: <6, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle 24: <6, 7, 8, 1>
- Cycle 25: <6, 8, 4, 1>
- Cycle 26: <7, 1, 3, 9>
- Cycle 27: <7, 1, 4, 6>
- Cycle 28: <7, 8, 4, 6>

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 2, 5> has the chord (3, 2)
- <1, 3, 6, 5> has the chord (3, 6)
- <1, 4, 6, 3> has the chord (6, 3)
- <1, 4, 8, 6> has the chord (4, 8)
- <1, 7, 8, 6> has the chord (7, 8)
- <2, 1, 4, 6> has the chord (1, 4)
- <2, 1, 3, 6> has the chord (1, 3)
- <3, 9, 7, 6> has the chord (9, 7)
- <5, 2, 9, 7> has the chord (2, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [19]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord are:
<1, 3, 2, 5>
<1, 3, 6, 5>
<1, 4, 6, 3>
<1, 4, 8, 6>
<1, 7, 8, 6>
<2, 1, 4, 6>
<2, 1, 3, 6>
<3, 9, 7, 6>
<5, 2, 9, 7>
