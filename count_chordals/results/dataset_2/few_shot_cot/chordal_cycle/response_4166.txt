Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. Cycle 0-5-1-7-4-0
2. Cycle 0-5-2-7-4-0
3. Cycle 0-3-4-7-2-0
4. Cycle 0-3-4-8-6-0
5. Cycle 0-3-8-4-7-0

Step 2: 
Out of the cycles listed above, checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each:
1. Cycle 0-5-1-7-4-0 has one chord - edge (1, 7) 
2. Cycle 0-5-2-7-4-0 has one chord - edge (2, 7)

Step 3: 
Since there are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the final answer is [2].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <0, 5, 1, 7> with chord (1, 7)
2. <0, 5, 2, 7> with chord (2, 7)
