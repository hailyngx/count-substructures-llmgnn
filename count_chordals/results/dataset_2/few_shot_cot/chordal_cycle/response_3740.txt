Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Chordal cycle 1: <0, (4, 12), 1, 0>
- Chordal cycle 2: <0, (4, 14), 16, 3, 8, 9, 2, 10, 6, 5, 18, 13, 1, 19, 0>
- Chordal cycle 3: <0, (4, 14), 15, 10, 6, 5, 18, 13, 1, 12, 11, 0>
- Chordal cycle 4: <1, (12, 11), 0, 4, 14, 15, 10, 6, 5, 18, 16, 3, 8, 9, 2, 1>
