Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (7, 9, 4, 8, 7)
- Cycle 2: (7, 4, 9, 6, 7)
- Cycle 3: (7, 4, 2, 1, 7)
- Cycle 4: (7, 8, 3, 0, 8)
- Cycle 5: (3, 9, 7, 5, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 8, 4, 9, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 7, 5, 7, 3)

Step 2:
Among these cycles, there is one unique chordal 4-cycle:
<7, 4, 9, 6, 7> (chord: (4, 2))

Step 3:
Since there is one unique chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
