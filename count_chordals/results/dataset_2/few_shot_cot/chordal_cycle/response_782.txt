Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- <1, 11, 7, 3, 14>
- <1, 11, 7, 3, 5>
- <1, 11, 7, 12, 6>
- <1, 11, 4, 6, 5>
- <1, 11, 4, 9, 8>
- <1, 11, 4, 14, 2>
- <1, 4, 9, 8, 5>
- <1, 4, 9, 12, 7>
- <1, 4, 14, 2, 11>
- <3, 14, 2, 11, 1>
- <3, 14, 2, 11, 7>
- <3, 14, 8, 5, 6>
- <3, 14, 8, 9, 7>
- <4, 14, 2, 11, 1>
- <4, 14, 2, 11, 7>
- <4, 14, 8, 5, 6>
- <4, 14, 8, 9, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <1, 11, 7, 3, 14> (Chord: 1-3)
- <1, 11, 7, 3, 5> (Chord: 1-5)
- <1, 11, 7, 12, 6> (Chord: 1-6)
- <1, 11, 4, 6, 5> (Chord: 11-6)
- <1, 11, 4, 9, 8> (Chord: 1-9)
- <1, 11, 4, 14, 2> (Chord: 1-2)
- <1, 4, 9, 8, 5> (Chord: 4-5)
- <1, 4, 9, 12, 7> (Chord: 4-7)
- <1, 4, 14, 2, 11> (Chord: 4-11)
- <3, 14, 2, 11, 1> (Chord: 14-1)
- <3, 14, 2, 11, 7> (Chord: 14-7)
- <3, 14, 8, 5, 6> (Chord: 8-6)
- <3, 14, 8, 9, 7> (Chord: 8-7)
- <4, 14, 2, 11, 1> (Chord: 14-1)
- <4, 14, 2, 11, 7> (Chord: 14-7)
- <4, 14, 8, 5, 6> (Chord: 14-6)
- <4, 14, 8, 9, 7> (Chord: 14-9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [16]
