Response:
Following the steps provided, we first need to list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17, 22>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17, 18>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17, 18, 25>
- Cycle 5: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17, 18, 25, 28>
- Cycle 6: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17, 18, 25, 28, 23>
- Cycle 7: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17, 18, 25, 28, 23, 26>
- Cycle 8: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17, 18, 25, 28, 23, 14>
- Cycle 9: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17, 18, 4, 24>
- Cycle 10: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17, 18, 4, 24, 16>
- Cycle 11: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17, 18, 4, 24, 5>
- Cycle 12: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17, 18, 9, 2>
- Cycle 13: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17, 18, 9, 2, 11>
- Cycle 14: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17, 22, 27, 11>
- Cycle 15: <0, 7, 6, 20, 17, 20>

Next, we need to check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- There is only one chord in cycle 5: Chord <25, 14>
- There is only one chord in cycle 13: Chord <9, 28>

Therefore, the total number of unique chordal 4-cycles is [2].
