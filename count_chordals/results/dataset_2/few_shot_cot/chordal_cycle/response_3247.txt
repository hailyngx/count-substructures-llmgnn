Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 6 - 9 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 6 - 9 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 6 - 7 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 4: 0 - 6 - 7 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 5: 4 - 6 - 9 - 1 - 4
- Cycle 6: 4 - 6 - 9 - 2 - 4
- Cycle 7: 4 - 8 - 9 - 2 - 4
- Cycle 8: 7 - 6 - 9 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 9: 7 - 6 - 9 - 2 - 7
- Cycle 10: 7 - 0 - 6 - 9 - 7
- Cycle 11: 7 - 0 - 6 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 12: 1 - 9 - 6 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 13: 1 - 9 - 6 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 14: 1 - 9 - 2 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 15: 1 - 9 - 2 - 4 - 1

- Cycle 18: 5 - 0 - 6 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 19: 5 - 0 - 6 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 20: 5 - 1 - 9 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 21: 5 - 1 - 9 - 2 - 5
- Cycle 22: 5 - 2 - 9 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 23: 5 - 2 - 9 - 4 - 5

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 12: 1 - 9 - 6 - 7 - 1 (Chord: 6-7)
- Cycle 16: 2 - 9 - 6 - 7 - 2 (Chord: 6-7)
- Cycle 14: 1 - 9 - 2 - 7 - 1 (Chord: 2-7)
- Cycle 15: 1 - 9 - 2 - 4 - 1 (Chord: 2-4)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 6, 9, 7>
- <2, 6, 9, 7>
- <1, 9, 2, 7>
- <1, 9, 2, 4>
