Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (2, 9, 1, 5, 8, 2)
- (2, 9, 1, 6, 7, 4, 2)
- (2, 9, 7, 4, 5, 8, 2)

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <2, 9, 1, 5> has chord (2, 8)
- <2, 9, 1, 6> has chord (4, 7)
- <2, 9, 7, 4> has chord (5, 8)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [0]
