Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, (6, 9), 10, 5> has one chord (6, 9)
- <1, (4, 9), 6, 3> has one chord (4, 9)
- <2, (5, 8), 8, 13> has one chord (5, 8)
- <3, (9, 10), 10, 7> has one chord (9, 10)
- <4, (9, 6), 6, 3> has one chord (9, 6)
- <5, (8, 13), 13, 10> has one chord (8, 13)
- <6, (1, 4), 4, 9> has one chord (1, 4)
- <7, (5, 10), 10, 13> has one chord (5, 10)
- <8, (5, 13), 13, 14> has one chord (5, 13)
- <9, (6, 1), 1, 4> has one chord (6, 1)
- <10, (5, 7), 7, 12> has one chord (5, 7)
- <11, (3, 9), 9, 6> has one chord (3, 9)
- <12, (7, 10), 10, 13> has one chord (7, 10)
- <13, (10, 8), 8, 5> has one chord (10, 8)
- <14, (8, 5), 5, 2> has one chord (8, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 0

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
