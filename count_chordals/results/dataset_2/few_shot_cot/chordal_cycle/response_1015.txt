Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <1, 6, 3, 7>, with the non-adjacent chord (1, 7).

Following the steps provided:
Step 1: List of possible cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- <1, 6, 3, 7>
- <1, 8, 2, 13>
- <1, 8, 9, 11>
- <1, 8, 9, 10>
- <1, 8, 10, 7>
- <1, 13, 5, 12>
- <6, 3, 7, 11>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 6, 3, 7> has the chord (1, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
