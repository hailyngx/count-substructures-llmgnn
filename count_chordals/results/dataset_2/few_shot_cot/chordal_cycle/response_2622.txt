Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 0: <1, 7, 4, 5, 6, 1>
- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 12, 7, 4, 2, 13, 3>
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 12, 11, 9, 10, 0, 6, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 13, 2, 4, 9, 11, 3>
- Cycle 4: <1, 3, 13, 10, 9, 4, 7, 5, 6, 0, 1>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 0 has no chord.
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (3, 12).
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (3, 12).
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (13, 2).
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (13, 10).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 1.
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 3, 13, 10, 9, 4, 7, 5, 6, 0, 1>.
