Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 16, 2, 9, 4> is a cycle of length 4.
- <0, 16, 2, 7, 5> is a cycle of length 4.
- <0, 16, 2, 17, 9> is a cycle of length 4.
- <0, 10, 6, 18, 14> is a cycle of length 4.
- <3, 8, 13, 5, 4> is a cycle of length 4.
- <3, 18, 6, 2, 7> is a cycle of length 4.
- <3, 8, 14, 19, 11> is a cycle of length 4.
- <4, 11, 19, 14, 8> is a cycle of length 4.
- <4, 9, 17, 2, 16> is a cycle of length 4.
- <7, 5, 13, 15, 3> is a cycle of length 4.
- <7, 2, 9, 11, 19> is a cycle of length 4.
- <8, 14, 18, 6, 10> is a cycle of length 4.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <3, 8, (13, 4), 5> has a chord (13, 4).
- <0, 16, (2, 9), 4> has a chord (2, 9).
- <0, 16, (2, 7), 5> has a chord (2, 7).
- <3, 8, (14, 19), 11> has a chord (14, 19).
- <4, 11, (19, 14), 8> has a chord (19, 14).
- <4, 9, (17, 2), 16> has a chord (17, 2).
- <7, 2, (9, 11), 19> has a chord (9, 11).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [7].
