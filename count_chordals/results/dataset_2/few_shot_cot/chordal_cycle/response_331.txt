Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <15, (10, 21), 17, 18)>. 

Now, let's count the number of chordless cycles found in the graph. 

Based on the steps provided in the prompt:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
There are many cycles in the graph but we will list only the chordless ones:
- Cycle 1: <0, 20, 28, 7, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 20, 5, 8, 11, 8, 5, 20, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 20, 2, 15, 1, 21, 10, 15, 2, 20, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 20, 13, 3, 5, 20, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 23, 12, 7, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 21, 17, 12, 23, 9, 18, 19, 26, 3, 22, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 15, 1, 21, 17, 12, 23, 9, 18, 19, 26, 3, 22, 2>
- Cycle 8: <5, 8, 11, 8, 5>
- Cycle 9: <6, 29, 6>
- Cycle 10: <16, 0, 20, 2, 15, 10, 21, 17, 12, 7, 28, 4, 20, 5, 3, 13, 6, 16>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
The unique chordal 4-cycle has already been identified. 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 10 chordless cycles found in the graph. 

Therefore, the final count of chordless cycles in the graph is [10].
