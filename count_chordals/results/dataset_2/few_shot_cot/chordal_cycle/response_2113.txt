Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 11) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 10) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 2) (3, 12) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 14) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 14) (6, 5) (12, 7) (12, 3) (12, 11) (9, 4) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 0) (11, 4) (11, 7) (11, 13) (11, 12) (11, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (14, 7) (14, 3) (14, 8) (14, 5) (10, 1) (10, 13) (10, 9) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 5) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 13, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, 5, 10, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 14, 2, 12, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 11, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, 6, 0, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 12, 11, 14, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 5, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 11, 10, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 13, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 7, 13, 12, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 11, 10, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 5

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are:
<0, 1, 7, 4> with a chord (1, 7)
<0, 5, 8, 14> with a chord (5, 8)
<1, 2, 4, 7> with a chord (2, 7)
<1, 3, 8, 14> with a chord (3, 8)
<1, 5, 14, 7> with a chord (5, 14)
<3, 12, 7, 4> with a chord (12, 7)

Therefore, there are a total of [6] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
