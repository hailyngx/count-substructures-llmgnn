Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (20, 25), 5>
- Chordal cycle 2: <1, (20, 26), 6>
- Chordal cycle 3: <1, (22, 19), 25>
- Chordal cycle 4: <1, (4, 13), 21>
- Chordal cycle 5: <1, (4, 24), 14>

- Chordal cycle 7: <2, (22, 19), 25>
- Chordal cycle 8: <6, (23, 22), 2>
- Chordal cycle 9: <8, (11, 28), 13>
- Chordal cycle 10: <13, (21, 17), 12>
- Chordal cycle 11: <16, (25, 19), 22>
- Chordal cycle 12: <20, (25, 19), 22>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- There are 26 chordless cycles found.

Put this final number inside brackets: [26].
