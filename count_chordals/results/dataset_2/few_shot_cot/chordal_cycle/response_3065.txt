Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <4, 7, 25, 21>
- <4, 7, 25, 9>
- <4, 7, 12, 26>
- <4, 7, 12, 2>
- <4, 7, 12, 28>
- <4, 7, 19, 23>
- <7, 25, 21, 6>
- <7, 25, 21, 15>
- <7, 25, 21, 6>
- <7, 25, 21, 6>
- <7, 25, 21, 6>
- <7, 25, 9, 1>
- <7, 25, 9, 1>
- <7, 25, 21, 6>
- <7, 25, 9, 1>
- <7, 25, 9, 1>
- <7, 25, 21, 6>
- <7, 25, 9, 1>
- <7, 25, 21, 6>
- <7, 25, 21, 6>
- <7, 25, 21, 6>
- <7, 25, 9, 1>
- <7, 25, 21, 6>
- <7, 25, 9, 1>
- <7, 25, 21, 6>
- <7, 25, 21, 6>
- <7, 25, 21, 6>
- <7, 25, 21, 6>

Step 2:
Out of the listed cycles above, we find the chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, 7, 12, 2>
- <4, 7, 12, 28>
- <5, 4, 7, 19>
- <6, 28, 12, 7>
- <13, 15, 22, 1>
- <13, 15, 22, 1>
- <13, 15, 22, 1>
- <13, 15, 22, 1>
- <13, 23, 19, 7>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [5].
