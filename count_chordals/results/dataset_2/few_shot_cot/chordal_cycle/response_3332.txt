Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 7, 3, 1> has the chord (7, 3)
- The cycle <0, 7, 12, 6> has the chord (7, 12)
- The cycle <0, 12, 9, 8> has the chord (12, 9)
- The cycle <1, 3, 13, 14> has the chord (3, 13)
- The cycle <1, 10, 7, 0> has the chord (10, 7)
- The cycle <2, 5, 14, 6> has the chord (5, 6)
- The cycle <2, 1, 3, 13> has the chord (1, 3)
- The cycle <3, 1, 10, 4> has the chord (1, 10)
- The cycle <4, 5, 14, 13> has the chord (5, 14)
- The cycle <5, 2, 8, 9> has the chord (2, 8)
- The cycle <6, 14, 13, 3> has the chord (14, 3)
- The cycle <7, 0, 12, 9> has the chord (0, 9)
- The cycle <8, 9, 10, 1> has the chord (9, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [2]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, 7, 3, 1>
- <6, 14, 13, 3>
