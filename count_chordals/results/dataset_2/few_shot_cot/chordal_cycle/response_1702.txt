Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 14, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 11, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 10, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 13, 9, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 0, 8, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 3, 11, 8, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 10, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 5, and node 13

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 10, 9, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 12, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 3, 12, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 4, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 4, 8, 12, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 9, 4, 11, 12, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 9, 1, 6, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle 8: <0, 9, 1, 6, 2, 12, 0>
- Cycle 9: <0, 9, 1, 6, 7, 4, 8, 12, 0>
- Cycle 10: <1, 6, 7, 4, 8, 12, 2, 14, 13, 10, 9, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has chord: (0, 12)
- Cycle 5 has chord: (4, 12)
- Cycle 6 has chord: (4, 12)
- Cycle 7 has chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 8 has chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 9 has chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 10 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 3 chordless cycles. Therefore, the answer is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 5, 10, 9, 0>
<0, 5, 12, 2, 0>
<0, 5, 3, 12, 0>
