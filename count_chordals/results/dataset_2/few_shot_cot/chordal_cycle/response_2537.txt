Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 7) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 9, 8, 5, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 5, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the given graph:
1. (4, 7, 1, 9, 4)
2. (4, 9, 7, 6, 4)
3. (7, 4, 8, 2, 7)
4. (7, 4, 9, 6, 7)
5. (7, 6, 5, 8, 7)
6. (6, 7, 1, 9, 6)
7. (9, 4, 8, 2, 9)
8. (8, 4, 9, 6, 8)

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the cycle (4, 9, 7, 6, 4) stands out as having exactly one chord (4, 7) connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle.

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles in the graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is < (4, 7), (9, 6) >.
