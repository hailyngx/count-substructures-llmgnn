Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 6) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 4) (6, 0) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 7, 4, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 2, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 2, 6, 3, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 4, 6, 2, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 0, 9, 4, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 5, 7, 1, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 6, 3, 9, 2>
- Cycle 9: <4, 9, 3, 6, 4>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 4, 1, 0> has chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 2, 5, 7, 0> has chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 2, 6, 3, 0> has chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 4, 6, 2, 0> has chord (9, 2)
- Cycle 5: <1, 0, 9, 4, 1> has chord (0, 4)
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 6, 2, 1> has chord (4, 2)
- Cycle 7: <2, 5, 7, 1, 2> has chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 8: <2, 6, 3, 9, 2> has chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 9: <4, 9, 3, 6, 4> has chord (9, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0]. 

Therefore, there are no unique chordal 4-cycles found in this graph.
