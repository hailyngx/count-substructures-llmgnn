Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <5, 9, 28, 0, 5>
- <5, 9, 28, 13, 5>
- <5, 9, 28, 29, 5>
- <5, 9, 11, 21, 25, 18, 12, 1, 8, 3, 17, 7, 26, 27, 29, 14, 6, 19, 5>
- <9, 5, 22, 8, 1, 19, 29, 14, 6, 19, 5>
- <2, 29, 28, 13, 28, 9, 5, 3, 17, 21, 11, 9, 28, 29, 19, 29, 2>
- <18, 25, 21, 17, 3, 5, 22, 8, 1, 19, 29, 14, 6, 19, 5, 9, 28, 0, 28, 29, 2, 24, 16, 2>
- <22, 8, 3, 17, 21, 11, 9, 28, 29, 19, 29, 14, 6, 19, 5, 3, 17, 7, 26, 21, 11, 9, 5>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 9, 28, 0, 5> (Chord: (9, 28))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 9, 11, 21, 25, 18, 12, 1, 8, 3, 17, 7, 26, 27, 29, 14, 6, 19, 5> (Chord: (6, 14))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <18, 25, 21, 17, 3, 5, 22, 8, 1, 19, 29, 14, 6, 19, 5, 9, 28, 0, 28, 29, 2, 24, 16, 2> (Chord: (8, 19))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in the graph. Therefore, the final count is [0].
