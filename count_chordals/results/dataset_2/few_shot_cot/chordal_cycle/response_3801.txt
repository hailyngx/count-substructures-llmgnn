Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 11, 8>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 19, 15>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 10, 4>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 15, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 10, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 15, 5, 0>
- Cycle 7: <2, 10, 4, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 7, 17, 14>
- Cycle 9: <3, 11, 8, 16>
- Cycle 10: <7, 17, 14, 8>
- Cycle 11: <8, 13, 18, 1>
- Cycle 12: <8, 11, 3, 0>
- Cycle 13: <8, 14, 17, 7>
- Cycle 14: <13, 8, 16, 2>
- Cycle 15: <15, 16, 2, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycles with exactly one chord:
  - Cycle 3: <0, 3, 10, 4> - Chord: (0, 10)
  - Cycle 5: <1, 4, 10, 0> - Chord: (1, 10)
  - Cycle 9: <3, 11, 8, 16> - Chord: (3, 8)
  - Cycle 14: <13, 8, 16, 2> - Chord: (8, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 15 cycles found, and 4 of them have exactly one chord.

Final count: [11]
