The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
1. Cycle: <0, 9, 6, 5, 2, 1> (length 5)
2. Cycle: <0, 9, 6, 4, 8, 7> (length 5)
3. Cycle: <0, 9, 6, 3, 5, 2> (length 5)
4. Cycle: <1, 3, 5, 8, 4> (length 4)
5. Cycle: <1, 3, 6, 5, 8> (length 4)
6. Cycle: <1, 3, 2, 5, 8> (length 4)
7. Cycle: <1, 4, 8, 7, 9> (length 4)
8. Cycle: <1, 4, 9, 7, 8> (length 4)
9. Cycle: <2, 5, 6, 9, 4> (length 4)
10. Cycle: <2, 5, 8, 7, 0> (length 4)
11. Cycle: <2, 7, 8, 4, 9> (length 4)
12. Cycle: <3, 5, 6, 4, 1> (length 4)
13. Cycle: <3, 5, 8, 7, 2> (length 4)
14. Cycle: <3, 6, 4, 1, 2> (length 4)
15. Cycle: <4, 6, 1, 3, 8> (length 4)
16. Cycle: <4, 8, 3, 1, 6> (length 4)

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles are:
1. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, 6, 5, (2, 1)> 
2. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, 6, 4, (8, 7)> 
3. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, 6, 3, (5, 2)>
4. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 3, 5, (8, 4)> 

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [12].
