2. Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (5, 6), 2>
3. Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (5, 6), 8>
4. Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, (5, 6), 8>
5. Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, (5, 6), 8>
6. Chordal 4-cycle 6: <0, (7, 9), 1>
7. Chordal 4-cycle 7: <0, (7, 9), 3>
8. Chordal 4-cycle 8: <0, (7, 9), 4>
9. Chordal 4-cycle 9: <0, (5, 2), 1>
10. Chordal 4-cycle 10: <0, (5, 8), 4>
11. Chordal 4-cycle 11: <1, (6, 5), 7>
12. Chordal 4-cycle 12: <1, (6, 8), 0>
13. Chordal 4-cycle 13: <2, (6, 5), 9>
