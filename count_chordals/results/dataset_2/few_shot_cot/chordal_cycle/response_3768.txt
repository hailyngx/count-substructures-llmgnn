- Cycle 20 has one chord: <1, 6, 2, 5> (Chord: (2, 5))
- Cycle 25 has one chord: <1, 6, 4, 11> (Chord: (4, 11))
- Cycle 26 has one chord: <1, 3, 13, 5> (Chord: (13, 5))
- Cycle 30 has one chord: <1, 3, 12, 14> (Chord: (12, 14))
- Cycle 32 has one chord: <3, 1, 0, 8> (Chord: (0, 8))
- Cycle 38 has one chord: <3, 13, 8, 0> (Chord: (8, 0))
- Cycle 41 has one chord: <3, 13, 4, 11> (Chord: (4, 11))
- Cycle 44 has one chord: <3, 12, 1, 6> (Chord: (1, 6))
- Cycle 46 has one chord: <3, 12, 1, 3> (Chord: (1, 3))

- Cycle 54 has one chord: <4, 13, 5, 13> (Chord: (5, 13))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [14].
