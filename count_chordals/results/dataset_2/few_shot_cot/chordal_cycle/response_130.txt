Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph with length 4 or more. 

Cycles:
- <0, 9, 6, 1, 0>
- <0, 9, 6, 2, 4, 0>
- <0, 9, 6, 4, 7, 0>
- <1, 6, 9, 7, 1>
- <1, 6, 2, 4, 1>
- <2, 6, 4, 7, 2>
- <3, 6, 9, 8, 3>
- <3, 7, 9, 8, 3>
- <4, 6, 9, 7, 4>
- <5, 1, 6, 4, 5>
- <0, 4, 7, 3, 8, 0>
- <0, 4, 9, 6, 2, 0>
- <1, 4, 6, 9, 1>
- <3, 4, 6, 2, 3>
- <4, 7, 9, 8, 4>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 6, 2, 4, 0>
- <0, 9, 6, 4, 7, 0>
- <1, 6, 2, 4, 1>
- <3, 6, 9, 8, 3>
- <3, 7, 9, 8, 3>
- <0, 4, 7, 3, 8, 0>
- <0, 4, 9, 6, 2, 0>
- <1, 4, 6, 9, 1>
- <3, 4, 6, 2, 3>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 9, 6, (2, 4), 0>
<0, 9, 6, (4, 7), 0>
<1, 6, (2, 4), 1>
<3, 6, 9, (8, 3), 3>
<3, 7, 9, (8, 3), 3>
<0, 4, 7, (3, 8), 0>
<0, 4, 9, 6, (2, 0)>
<1, 4, 6, 9, 1>
<3, 4, 6, (2, 3)>
