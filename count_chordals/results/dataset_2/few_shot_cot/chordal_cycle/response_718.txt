Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
In this graph, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <0, (2, 3), 6>. 

Following the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
Step 1: Identify all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 0-6-4-9-0
- Cycle 2: 0-6-7-4-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-2-7-0
- Cycle 4: 2-9-4-8-2
- Cycle 5: 2-9-3-0-2
- Cycle 6: 2-7-4-8-2
- Cycle 7: 2-7-6-3-2
- Cycle 8: 3-6-7-4-3
- Cycle 9: 3-6-8-4-3

Step 2: Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord, 9-3.
- Cycle 3 has one chord, 3-7.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [7]
