Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0)

Node 2 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 1, 4)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 7, 8)
- Cycle 4: (9, 6, 0, 8)
- Cycle 5: (9, 6, 3, 4)
- Cycle 6: (9, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 7: (6, 1, 4, 3)
- Cycle 8: (6, 1, 2, 8)
- Cycle 9: (8, 7, 5, 9)
- Cycle 10: (8, 7, 9, 6)
- Cycle 11: (8, 7, 5, 1)
- Cycle 12: (7, 5, 1, 4)
- Cycle 13: (7, 5, 9, 6)
- Cycle 14: (7, 5, 0, 8)
- Cycle 15: (5, 1, 6, 0)
- Cycle 16: (9, 7, 8, 2)
- Cycle 17: (4, 1, 6, 3)
- Cycle 18: (4, 1, 2, 8)
- Cycle 19: (3, 4, 8, 7)
- Cycle 20: (3, 4, 1, 6)
- Cycle 21: (3, 4, 1, 5)
- Cycle 22: (3, 0, 6, 9)
- Cycle 23: (3, 0, 8, 7)
- Cycle 24: (0, 5, 7, 8)
- Cycle 25: (0, 5, 1, 6)
  
Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <1, (0, 8), 4> - Chord: (0, 8)
- <2, (1, 4), 5> - Chord: (1, 4)
- <3, (7, 9), 8> - Chord: (7, 9)
- <4, (0, 6), 8> - Chord: (0, 6)
- <5, (4, 6), 9> - Chord: (4, 6)
- <6, (5, 9), 1> - Chord: (5, 9)
- <7, (1, 2), 6> - Chord: (1, 2)
- <8, (5, 7), 9> - Chord: (5, 7)
- <9, (4, 7), 8> - Chord: (4, 7)
- <10, (7, 9), 8> - Chord: (7, 9)
- <11, (5, 7), 8> - Chord: (5, 7)
- <12, (1, 4), 5> - Chord: (1, 4)
- <13, (5, 9), 6> - Chord: (5, 9)
- <14, (0, 6), 3> - Chord: (0, 6)
- <15, (7, 9), 8> - Chord: (7, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 2 chordless cycles found. So, the final answer is [2].
