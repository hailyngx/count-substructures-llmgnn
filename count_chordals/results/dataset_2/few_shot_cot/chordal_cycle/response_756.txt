Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 12) (11, 4) (16, 11) (16, 7) (16, 8) (16, 6) (14, 12) (14, 19) (14, 10) (17, 8) (17, 18) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 9) (8, 6) (13, 15) (0, 5) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 19) (5, 0) (5, 2) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 14) (19, 2) (19, 5) (19, 1) (9, 8) (9, 18) (9, 10) (7, 16) (7, 10) (18, 17) (18, 9) (18, 6) (3, 4) (4, 11) (4, 3) (4, 15) (6, 16) (6, 8) (6, 18) (6, 15) (10, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (15, 13) (15, 5) (15, 4) (15, 6) (15, 12) (12, 11) (12, 14) (12, 15) (12, 1) (1, 0) (1, 19) (1, 12)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <3, 4, 11, 16> 
- Cycle 2: <3, 4, 15, 6> 
- Cycle 3: <5, 0, 1, 12> 
- Cycle 4: <5, 0, 1, 19> 
- Cycle 5: <5, 0, 1, 12> 
- Cycle 6: <5, 15, 13, 4> 
- Cycle 7: <5, 15, 13, 5> 
- Cycle 8: <5, 15, 13, 6> 
- Cycle 9: <5, 15, 4, 11> 
- Cycle 10: <5, 15, 4, 3> 
- Cycle 11: <5, 19, 2, 14> 
- Cycle 12: <5, 19, 2, 1> 
- Cycle 13: <5, 19, 2, 5> 
- Cycle 14: <5, 19, 14, 10> 
- Cycle 15: <5, 19, 14, 12> 
- Cycle 16: <5, 19, 14, 10> 
- Cycle 17: <5, 19, 14, 12> 
- Cycle 18: <5, 19, 14, 10> 
- Cycle 19: <5, 19, 14, 12> 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <3, 4, 11, 16> has one chord: (3, 16)
- <5, 0, 1, 12> has one chord: (0, 12)
- <5, 0, 1, 19> has one chord: (0, 19)
- <5, 15, 13, 4> has one chord: (15, 4)
- <5, 19, 2, 14> has one chord: (2, 14)
- <5, 19, 2, 1> has one chord: (2, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- There are 6 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Final answer: [6]
