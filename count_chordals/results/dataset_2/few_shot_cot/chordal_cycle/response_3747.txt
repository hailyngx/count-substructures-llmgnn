Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 2, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 14, 12, 4, 6, 11, 14, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 7, 4, 6, 13, 11, 8, 2>
- Cycle 4: <3, 4, 7, 0, 6, 13, 3>
- Cycle 5: <5, 8, 3, 13, 10, 5>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- In Cycle 1, there is one unique chord: (2, 8) <0, (2, 8), 7>
- In Cycle 2, there is one unique chord: (9, 12) <1, (9, 12), 14>
- In Cycle 3, there is one unique chord: (4, 11) <2, (4, 11), 7>
- In Cycle 4, there is one unique chord: (0, 6) <3, (0, 6), 4>
- In Cycle 5, there are no unique chords.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There is only one chordless cycle: Cycle 5

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the provided graph is [1].
