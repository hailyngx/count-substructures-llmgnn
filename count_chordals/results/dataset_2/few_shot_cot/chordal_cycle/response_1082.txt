Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 3, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 3, 6, 2, 13, 1, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 9, 4, 12, 0, 3, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 1, 6, 7, 11, 14, 8, 10, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 1, 6, 2, 13, 9, 4, 12, 5)
- Cycle 7: (9, 3, 6, 7, 11, 14, 8, 13, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 3, 6, 1, 13, 2, 0, 12, 9)
- Cycle 9: (9, 4, 12, 0, 3, 6, 1, 10, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1 has one chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (9, 1)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 5 has no chords
- Cycle 6 has no chords
- Cycle 7 has no chords
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (9, 13)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (9, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are two chordless cycles: Cycle 5 and Cycle 6.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <5, 1, 6, 7>
- <5, 9, 4, 12>
