Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <4, 1, 7, 6>
2. <4, 1, 9, 6>
3. <4, 7, 6, 9>
4. <4, 7, 2, 6>
5. <4, 9, 6, 8>
6. <4, 9, 8, 3>
7. <4, 9, 3, 1>
8. <1, 7, 6, 9>
9. <1, 7, 2, 6>
10. <1, 3, 9, 6>
11. <1, 3, 2, 7>
12. <3, 9, 6, 8>
13. <3, 9, 8, 4>
14. <3, 2, 7, 4>
15. <6, 7, 2, 3>
16. <6, 9, 8, 4>
17. <6, 9, 4, 1>
18. <6, 9, 1, 7>
19. <6, 2, 7, 4>
20. <6, 2, 3, 8>
21. <9, 4, 8, 3>
22. <9, 4, 1, 7>
23. <9, 3, 1, 7>
24. <8, 4, 9, 6>
25. <8, 4, 7, 2>
26. <8, 3, 1, 7>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle) are:
1. <4, 1, 7, 6> (Chord: (1, 6))
2. <4, 1, 9, 6> (Chord: (1, 9))
3. <4, 9, 6, 8> (Chord: (9, 8))
4. <1, 7, 6, 9> (Chord: (7, 9))
5. <1, 3, 9, 6> (Chord: (3, 9))
6. <6, 9, 8, 4> (Chord: (9, 4))
7. <6, 9, 4, 1> (Chord: (9, 1))
8. <6, 2, 7, 4> (Chord: (2, 7))
9. <9, 4, 8, 3> (Chord: (4, 3))
10. <8, 4, 9, 6> (Chord: (4, 6))

Step 3:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
