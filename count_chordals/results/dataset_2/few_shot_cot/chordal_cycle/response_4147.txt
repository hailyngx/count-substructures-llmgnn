Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Listing cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 1, 8, 9, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 9, 7, 6, 3, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 9, 7, 6, 0, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 8, 9, 7, 6, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 9, 8, 5, 1, 2>
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 1, 6, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 5, 0, 4, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 6, 7, 9, 5, 3>
- Cycle 11: <4, 0, 5, 1, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 0, 9, 7, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 13: <5, 1, 8, 9, 5>
- Cycle 14: <5, 3, 6, 7, 9, 5>
- Cycle 15: <5, 3, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 16: <5, 8, 1, 6, 3, 5>
- Cycle 17: <6, 7, 9, 0, 3, 6>
- Cycle 18: <7, 9, 5, 8, 7>
- Cycle 19: <9, 7, 6, 1, 8, 9>
- Cycle 20: <9, 8, 5, 0, 9>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, 1, 6, 0> --> Chord: (1, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, 1, 8, 9, 0> --> Chord: (1, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, 9, 7, 6, 3, 0> --> Chord: (9, 3)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 5, 9, 7, 6, 0, 1> --> Chord: (9, 0)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 9, 8, 5, 1, 2> --> Chord: (5, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 5, 0, 4, 3> --> Chord: (0, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 0, 9, 7, 6, 1, 4> --> Chord: (9, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 7, 6, 1, 8, 9> --> Chord: (6, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
Hence, there are a total of [12] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
