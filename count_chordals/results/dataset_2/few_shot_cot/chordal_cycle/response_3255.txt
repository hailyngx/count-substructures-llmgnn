Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 9, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 1, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 5, 4, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 6, 5, 4, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 6, 1, 4, 2>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 9, 4, 2>
- Cycle 8: <3, 7, 4, 9, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 7, 9, 8, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 7, 2, 6, 3>
- Cycle 11: <4, 1, 8, 9, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 1, 6, 9, 4>
- Cycle 13: <4, 3, 2, 7, 4>
- Cycle 14: <4, 3, 7, 9, 4>
- Cycle 15: <4, 3, 7, 2, 4>
- Cycle 16: <4, 7, 2, 6, 4>
- Cycle 17: <4, 7, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 18: <5, 6, 1, 8, 5>
- Cycle 19: <5, 6, 9, 4, 5>
- Cycle 20: <6, 9, 8, 0, 6>
- Cycle 21: <6, 9, 7, 4, 6>
- Cycle 22: <7, 9, 8, 2, 7>
- Cycle 23: <8, 9, 7, 3, 8>
- Cycle 24: <8, 9, 6, 2, 8>

Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
    <0, 6, 5, 4, (0, 8)>
    <0, 6, 1, 4, (0, 8)>
    <2, 6, 5, 4, (2, 7)>
    <2, 6, 1, 4, (2, 7)>
    <4, 1, 6, 9, (4, 7)>
    <4, 3, 7, 9, (4, 1)>
    <4, 7, 2, 6, (4, 3)>
    <4, 7, 9, 8, (4, 3)>
    <6, 9, 8, 0, (6, 1)>
    <7, 9, 8, 2, (7, 3)>
    <8, 9, 6, 2, (8, 1)>

Step 3:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final number is [11].
