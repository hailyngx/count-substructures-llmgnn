Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (10, 11, 16, 24)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 9, 20)
- Cycle 3: (3, 15, 29, 21)
- Cycle 4: (20, 9, 15, 29)
- Cycle 5: (25, 20, 14, 1)
- Cycle 6: (27, 3, 15, 9)
- Cycle 7: (2, 5, 16, 11)
- Cycle 8: (6, 22, 12, 10)
- Cycle 9: (18, 17, 16, 11)
- Cycle 10: (14, 20, 9, 15)
- Cycle 11: (1, 14, 20, 9)
- Cycle 12: (21, 29, 15, 9)
- Cycle 13: (4, 1, 14, 26)

- Cycle 17: (27, 6, 22, 12)
- Cycle 18: (13, 7, 21, 29)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (16, 2)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (9, 23)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (15, 3)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (20, 25)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (5, 17)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (22, 6)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (17, 5)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (20, 23)
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (15, 29)
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (14, 1)
- Cycle 15 has a chord: (15, 9)
- Cycle 16 has a chord: (5, 16)
- Cycle 17 has a chord: (6, 27)
- Cycle 18 has a chord: (21, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 4 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <10, 11, 16, 24> with chord (16, 2)
- <3, 15, 9, 20> with chord (9, 23)
- <14, 20, 9, 15> with chord (20, 23)
- <18, 17, 16, 11> with chord (17, 5)
