Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (0, 4) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 1, 9, 5) with edges (5, 4), (4, 1), (1, 9), (9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 8, 2, 6, 7, 5) with edges (5, 8), (8, 2), (2, 6), (6, 7), (7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 2, 6, 8, 5) with edges (5, 7), (7, 2), (2, 6), (6, 8), (8, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Among the above cycles, only Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (4, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- The final count is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, (4, 9), 5>
