Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 15, 12>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 5, 7>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 19, 8>
- Cycle 4: <0, 8, 17, 13>
- Cycle 5: <0, 8, 19, 3>
- Cycle 6: <3, 5, 18, 12>
- Cycle 7: <3, 15, 12, 18>
- Cycle 8: <3, 15, 5, 18>
- Cycle 9: <3, 19, 8, 17>
- Cycle 10: <3, 19, 8, 0>
- Cycle 11: <5, 18, 12, 15>

Step 2:
- Chordal cycle 1: <0, 3, 5, 7> has the chord (3, 5)
- Chordal cycle 2: <0, 3, 19, 8> has the chord (3, 19)

Step 3:
- Total number of chordless cycles found: [17]
