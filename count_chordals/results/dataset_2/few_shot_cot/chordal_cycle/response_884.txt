Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- <0, 4, 8, 11> 
- <0, 4, 15, 13> 
- <2, 0, 4, 15> 
- <2, 0, 9, 7> 
- <2, 12, 14, 8> 
- <5, 19, 13, 14> 
- <3, 11, 8, 14> 
- <3, 18, 10, 15> 
- <6, 17, 1, 16> 
- <6, 17, 9, 7> 

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
- <0, 4, 8, 11> with chord (8, 11) 
- <0, 4, 15, 13> with chord (15, 13) 
- <2, 0, 4, 15> with chord (4, 15) 
- <2, 0, 9, 7> with chord (9, 7) 
- <2, 12, 14, 8> with chord (14, 8) 
- <5, 19, 13, 14> with chord (19, 14) 
- <3, 11, 8, 14> with chord (11, 14) 
- <3, 18, 10, 15> with chord (18, 15) 
- <6, 17, 1, 16> with chord (17, 16) 
- <6, 17, 9, 7> with chord (17, 9) 

Step 3: 
There are a total of [10] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
