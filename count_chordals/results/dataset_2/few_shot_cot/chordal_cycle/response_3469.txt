Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <7, 15, 5, 2> (Chord: (2, 5))
- <0, 2, 1, 17> (Chord: (1, 2))
- <13, 0, 16, 14> (Chord: (0, 16))
- <5, 15, 8, 14> (Chord: (8, 14))
- <3, 15, 3, 11> (Chord: (3, 11))
- <4, 10, 16, 12> (Chord: (10, 16))
- <9, 6, 3, 15> (Chord: (3, 15))
- <17, 1, 2, 9> (Chord: (1, 2))
- <16, 4, 10, 12> (Chord: (10, 4))
- <14, 18, 0, 13> (Chord: (0, 13))
- <7, 15, 8, 14> (Chord: (8, 15))
- <18, 7, 15, 5> (Chord: (7, 15))
- <16, 14, 7, 17> (Chord: (14, 7))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the count is [13].
