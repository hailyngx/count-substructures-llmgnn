- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 15, 20, 25> - Chord: (4, 29)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, 29, 18, 25> - Chord: (10, 29)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, 3, 24, 25> - Chord: (18, 19)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, 11, 9, 28> - Chord: (12, 23)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, 13, 25, 5> - Chord: (26, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <1, 25, 24, 19> - Chord: (3, 26)
