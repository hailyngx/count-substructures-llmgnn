Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 5, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 3, 1, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 7, 5, 2, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 4, 7, 8, 6, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 1, 4, 8, 5, 2>
- Cycle 6: <3, 5, 7, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 7: <5, 9, 3, 6, 8, 5>

Step 2:
- Checking for chords in each cycle:
    - Cycle 1 has chord (5, 7)
    - Cycle 2 has chord (9, 1)
    - Cycle 3 has chord (3, 5)
    - Cycle 4 has chord (4, 8)
    - Cycle 5 has chord (1, 8)
    - Cycle 6 has chord (7, 4)
    - Cycle 7 has chord (5, 3)

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles = [0]
