Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 14) (9, 1) (7, 3) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 10) (12, 14) (0, 5) (0, 14) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 13) (0, 2) (14, 9) (14, 12) (14, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 11) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 2) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 1) (11, 4) (11, 2) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 3) (13, 4) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 1) (4, 11) (4, 13) (4, 10) (2, 0) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 11) (2, 10) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 11) (1, 8) (10, 12) (10, 4) (10, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 14, 8, 1, 13, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 11, and node 8

Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 11, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 14, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 12, 4, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 10, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are two cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. <0, 5, 6, 2>
2. <0, 5, 13, 3>

Step 2:
- The cycle <0, 5, 6, 2> has a chord (0, 2) that connects non-adjacent nodes.
- The cycle <0, 5, 13, 3> has a chord (5, 3) that connects non-adjacent nodes.

Step 3:
- The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [2].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph are <0, 5, 6, 2> and <0, 5, 13, 3>.
