Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 5, 4> has a chord: (0, 5)
- <0, 9, 12, 7> has a chord: (9, 12)
- <0, 9, 5, 11> has a chord: (9, 5)
- <0, 9, 1, 7> has a chord: (9, 1)
- <0, 9, 4, 11> has a chord: (9, 4)
- <0, 10, 4, 11> has a chord: (10, 4)
- <0, 3, 8, 11> has a chord: (8, 11)
- <1, 9, 5, 11> has a chord: (9, 5)
- <1, 9, 4, 10> has a chord: (9, 4)
- <1, 13, 3, 8> has a chord: (13, 3)
- <2, 12, 7, 1> has a chord: (12, 7)
- <3, 8, 11, 5> has a chord: (8, 11)
- <3, 13, 1, 7> has a chord: (13, 1)
- <4, 5, 9, 1> has a chord: (9, 1)
- <4, 11, 5, 9> has a chord: (11, 5)
- <5, 9, 4, 10> has a chord: (9, 4)
- <6, 7, 12, 2> has a chord: (7, 12)
- <7, 8, 11, 5> has a chord: (8, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 33 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [33].
