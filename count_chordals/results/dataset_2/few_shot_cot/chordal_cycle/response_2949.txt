Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. We need to identify the cycles that have exactly one chord.

Step 2:
- Cycle <6, 9, 0, 27> has one chord: edge (0, 15).
- Cycle <6, 0, 15, 4> has one chord: edge (4, 7).
- Cycle <6, 15, 4, 7> has one chord: edge (7, 24).
- Cycle <6, 3, 23, 12> has one chord: edge (12, 18).
- Cycle <9, 0, 15, 4> has one chord: edge (4, 16).
- Cycle <9, 6, 15, 0> has one chord: edge (0, 27).
- Cycle <0, 27, 11, 25> has one chord: edge (11, 25).
- Cycle <0, 15, 12, 18> has one chord: edge (12, 23).
- Cycle <27, 11, 23, 17> has one chord: edge (17, 8).
- Cycle <4, 7, 24, 25> has one chord: edge (24, 25).
- Cycle <7, 24, 25, 18> has one chord: edge (18, 20).
- Cycle <14, 22, 19, 5> has one chord: edge (19, 22).
- Cycle <21, 14, 22, 5> has one chord: edge (21, 8).
- Cycle <10, 26, 13, 29> has one chord: edge (13, 1).
- Cycle <10, 20, 29, 13> has one chord: edge (13, 23).

Step 3:
We have identified 14 unique chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [14].
