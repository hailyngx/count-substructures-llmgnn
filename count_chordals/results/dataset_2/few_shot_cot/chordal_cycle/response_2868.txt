Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: <0, 13, 4, 14>
- Cycle 2: <0, 13, 7, 14>
- Cycle 3: <0, 14, 4, 13>
- Cycle 4: <2, 5, 1, 10>
- Cycle 5: <2, 5, 10, 3>
- Cycle 6: <2, 12, 10, 3>
- Cycle 7: <2, 9, 3, 12>
- Cycle 8: <3, 4, 12, 2>
- Cycle 9: <3, 4, 14, 0>
- Cycle 10: <3, 7, 13, 8>
- Cycle 11: <3, 7, 14, 8>
- Cycle 12: <4, 12, 8, 13>
- Cycle 13: <4, 14, 0, 13>
- Cycle 14: <7, 13, 8, 9>
- Cycle 15: <7, 14, 8, 9>
- Cycle 16: <8, 9, 2, 12>
- Cycle 17: <8, 9, 3, 7>
- Cycle 18: <9, 2, 12, 8>
- Cycle 19: <9, 3, 7, 14>

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- The cycle <2, 5, 1, 10> has exactly one chord (5, 10).
- The cycle <2, 12, 10, 3> has exactly one chord (12, 3).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <2, 5, 1, 10>
- <2, 12, 10, 3>
