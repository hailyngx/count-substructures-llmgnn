Response:
For this graph, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, 3, 7, 9>.

Now, let's proceed to count the number of chordless 4-cycles in this graph:

The only chordal 4-cycle found needs to be discounted from the total number of cycles of length 4 or more that we will list in Step 1. 

Let's list all such cycles, check for chords in Step 2, and count the number of chordless cycles in Step 3.

Step 1: 
- Cycle: <5, 3, 7, 9>
- Cycle: <5, 3, 2, 8>
- Cycle: <5, 3, 10, 13>
- Cycle: <5, 10, 13, 6>
- Cycle: <5, 10, 2, 14>
- Cycle: <5, 14, 9, 7>
- Cycle: <5, 14, 2, 8>
- Cycle: <9, 7, 3, 10>
- Cycle: <9, 7, 8, 2>
- Cycle: <9, 6, 12, 2>
- Cycle: <9, 6, 4, 13>
- Cycle: <9, 14, 2, 8>
- Cycle: <6, 4, 1, 11>
- Cycle: <6, 13, 8, 2>
- Cycle: <4, 1, 11, 8>
- Cycle: <4, 1, 13, 6>
- Cycle: <4, 14, 2, 8>
- Cycle: <7, 3, 10, 13>
- Cycle: <7, 8, 2, 12>
- Cycle: <8, 12, 2, 14>
- Cycle: <13, 1, 11, 8>
- Cycle: <10, 2, 14, 5>
- Cycle: <2, 8, 12, 6>

Step 2:
- Chord found in cycle <5, 3, 7, 9>

Step 3:
As only one chord was found in the listed cycles, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [21].
