Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 7, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 9, 5, 3, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 9, 6, 3, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 9, 5, 8, 7>
- Cycle 6: <3, 5, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle 7: <3, 5, 9, 2, 0>
- Cycle 8: <3, 9, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 9: <4, 6, 1, 3, 5>
- Cycle 10: <4, 6, 3, 2, 9>
- Cycle 11: <4, 6, 1, 7, 8>
- Cycle 12: <5, 9, 2, 0, 4>
- Cycle 13: <5, 9, 3, 1, 7>
- Cycle 14: <5, 8, 7, 1, 3>
- Cycle 15: <6, 9, 2, 0, 4>
- Cycle 16: <6, 1, 7, 8, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <0, 5, 9, 6, 4> has a chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 8 <3, 9, 6, 1, 7> has a chord (1, 7)
- Cycle 13 <5, 9, 3, 1, 7> has a chord (3, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
We found 13 chordless cycles, so the final count is [13].
