Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows: 

Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 13, 6> with no chords 
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 9, 14> with a chord (1, 9) 
- Cycle 3: <0, 8, 4, 17> with a chord (4, 17) 
- Cycle 4: <0, 8, 10, 16> with no chords 
- Cycle 5: <0, 16, 3, 4> with no chords 
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 2, 16> with no chords 
- Cycle 7: <3, 4, 8, 10> with no chords 
- Cycle 8: <6, 11, 15, 12> with no chords 
- Cycle 9: <9, 14, 17, 18> with a chord (14, 17) 

Step 2: 
- Chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord: <0, 1, 9, 14> with chord (1, 9) 

Step 3: 
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph: [1]
