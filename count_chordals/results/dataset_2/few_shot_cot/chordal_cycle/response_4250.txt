Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<0, 6, 2, 1>  Cycle of length 4
<0, 6, 3, 5>  Cycle of length 4
<0, 6, 4, 5>  Cycle of length 4
<0, 6, 4, 9>  Cycle of length 4
<0, 6, 2, 4>  Cycle of length 4
<0, 6, 3, 2>  Cycle of length 4
<1, 2, 6, 3>  Cycle of length 4
<1, 2, 4, 6>  Cycle of length 4
<1, 2, 3, 5>  Cycle of length 4
<1, 2, 4, 5>  Cycle of length 4
<2, 6, 4, 5>  Cycle of length 4
<2, 6, 3, 5>  Cycle of length 4
<3, 6, 4, 9>  Cycle of length 4
<3, 6, 2, 1>  Cycle of length 4
<4, 5, 8, 9>  Cycle of length 4
<4, 5, 8, 6>  Cycle of length 4
<5, 3, 6, 4>  Cycle of length 4
<5, 3, 2, 4>  Cycle of length 4
<6, 4, 5, 8>  Cycle of length 4
<6, 4, 0, 7>  Cycle of length 4
<7, 0, 3, 5>  Cycle of length 4
<7, 0, 4, 5>  Cycle of length 4
<8, 5, 4, 9>  Cycle of length 4
<8, 5, 3, 6>  Cycle of length 4
<9, 4, 6, 3>  Cycle of length 4
<9, 4, 0, 7>  Cycle of length 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles:
<0, (3, 5), 6, 4>
<4, (5, 8), 9, 6>
<6, (3, 2), 1, 2>
<8, (5, 9), 4, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are [0] chordless cycles in the graph.
