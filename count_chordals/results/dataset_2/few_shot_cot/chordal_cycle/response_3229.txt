Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <1, (11, 0), 9, 14>
- <3, (13, 0), 9, 12>
- <5, (12, 10), 7, 3>
- <8, (0, 11), 14, 9>
- <12, (10, 7), 3, 5>
- <13, (14, 4), 2, 3>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (11, 0), 9, 14> has exactly one chord (11, 0)
- <3, (13, 0), 9, 12> has exactly one chord (13, 0)
- <5, (12, 10), 7, 3> has exactly one chord (12, 10)
- <8, (0, 11), 14, 9> has exactly one chord (0, 11)
- <12, (10, 7), 3, 5> has exactly one chord (10, 7)
- <13, (14, 4), 2, 3> has exactly one chord (14, 4)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 0 chordless cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
