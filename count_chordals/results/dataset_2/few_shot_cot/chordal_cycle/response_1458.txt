Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2)

Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
1. <0, 5, 4, 9>
2. <0, 4, 9, 8>
3. <0, 4, 2, 9>
4. <0, 4, 3, 6>
5. <0, 6, 3, 4>
6. <1, 3, 4, 8>
7. <1, 4, 8, 9>
8. <1, 4, 3, 6>
9. <1, 7, 6, 3>
10. <1, 7, 8, 9>
11. <1, 7, 2, 9>
12. <2, 9, 8, 1>
13. <2, 9, 4, 3>
14. <2, 9, 7, 1>
15. <2, 4, 3, 6>
16. <2, 4, 8, 9>
17. <2, 4, 0, 6>
18. <3, 4, 8, 9>
19. <3, 4, 2, 9>
20. <4, 9, 8, 1>
21. <4, 9, 2, 3>
22. <4, 2, 9, 8>
23. <6, 3, 4, 8>
24. <6, 3, 1, 7>
25. <6, 0, 4, 8>
26. <7, 1, 8, 9>
27. <7, 1, 3, 6>
28. <7, 1, 2, 9>
29. <7, 2, 9, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
1. <1, 3, 4, 8> has a chord (3, 8)
2. <1, 7, 6, 3> has a chord (7, 3)
3. <1, 7, 8, 9> has a chord (1, 9)
4. <1, 7, 2, 9> has a chord (7, 2)
5. <2, 9, 4, 3> has a chord (9, 3)
6. <2, 4, 8, 9> has a chord (4, 9)
7. <6, 3, 1, 7> has a chord (3, 7)
8. <6, 0, 4, 8> has a chord (0, 4)
9. <7, 1, 8, 9> has a chord (1, 9)
10. <7, 1, 3, 6> has a chord (1, 6)
11. <7, 1, 2, 9> has a chord (1, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [29].
