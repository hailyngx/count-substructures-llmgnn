Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 6, 7, 9, 12>
- Cycle <1, 8, 2, 3, 5>
- Cycle <2, 6, 7, 8, 11>
- Cycle <2, 4, 5, 10, 14>
- Cycle <3, 5, 13, 1, 8>
- Cycle <4, 5, 13, 0, 6>
- Cycle <4, 10, 12, 9, 7>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 6, 7, 9, 12> has one chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle <1, 8, 2, 3, 5> has one chord: (3, 8)
- Cycle <2, 6, 7, 8, 11> has one chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle <2, 4, 5, 10, 14> has one chord: (4, 10)
- Cycle <3, 5, 13, 1, 8> has one chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle <4, 5, 13, 0, 6> has one chord: (0, 5)
- Cycle <4, 10, 12, 9, 7> has one chord: (9, 10)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 6, 7, 9, 12>
<1, 8, 2, 3, 5>
<2, 6, 7, 8, 11>
<2, 4, 5, 10, 14>
<3, 5, 13, 1, 8>
<4, 5, 13, 0, 6>
<4, 10, 12, 9, 7>
