Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 11, 12>
- Cycle 3: <0, 14, 4, 6>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 10, 9>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 8, 2>
- Cycle 6: <1, 8, 2, 4>
- Cycle 7: <1, 14, 6, 4>
- Cycle 8: <2, 11, 10, 5>
- Cycle 9: <2, 4, 6, 7>
- Cycle 10: <3, 1, 14, 6>
- Cycle 11: <3, 11, 2, 8>
- Cycle 12: <4, 5, 8, 2>
- Cycle 13: <4, 5, 12, 11>
- Cycle 14: <4, 6, 14, 0>
- Cycle 15: <5, 8, 7, 6>
- Cycle 16: <5, 9, 2, 10>
- Cycle 17: <6, 3, 1, 5>
- Cycle 18: <6, 4, 12, 13>
- Cycle 19: <9, 5, 10, 11>
- Cycle 20: <10, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 21: <11, 3, 0, 14>
- Cycle 22: <11, 10, 2, 4>
- Cycle 23: <12, 5, 9, 10>
- Cycle 24: <12, 0, 3, 1>
- Cycle 25: <14, 1, 3, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycles:
    - <1, 5, 8, 2, (4)>
    - <4, 5, 12, 11, (2)>
    - <12, 0, 3, 1, (14)>
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [3]
