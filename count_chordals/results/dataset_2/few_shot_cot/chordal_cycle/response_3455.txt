Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 2, 14, 4>
- <0, 2, 7, 10>
- <0, 2, 8, 6>
- <0, 12, 9, 8>
- <0, 12, 6, 4>
- <0, 14, 3, 5>
- <1, 11, 9, 8>
- <1, 11, 4, 6>
- <1, 4, 6, 12>
- <2, 7, 5, 3>
- <2, 7, 10, 5>
- <2, 8, 6, 3>
- <2, 8, 9, 11>
- <2, 14, 3, 13>
- <3, 5, 7, 10>
- <3, 5, 13, 12>
- <3, 6, 8, 9>
- <3, 11, 9, 12>
- <3, 12, 0, 14>
- <3, 12, 1, 11>
- <4, 6, 8, 9>
- <4, 6, 12, 1>
- <4, 11, 9, 12>
- <5, 7, 10, 2>
- <5, 13, 12, 1>
- <6, 8, 9, 11>
- <7, 2, 8, 6>
- <7, 5, 3, 14>
- <9, 8, 6, 4>
- <9, 11, 3, 14>
- <10, 5, 13, 12>
- <13, 5, 7, 2>

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
- <0, 2, 14, 4> (2, 14)
- <0, 12, 9, 8> (9, 12)
- <0, 14, 3, 5> (3, 14)
- <1, 11, 9, 8> (9, 11)
- <2, 8, 9, 11> (8, 9)
- <2, 14, 3, 13> (3, 14)
- <3, 5, 13, 12> (5, 13)
- <3, 11, 9, 12> (9, 11)
- <4, 6, 8, 9> (6, 8)
- <4, 11, 9, 12> (11, 9)
- <5, 7, 10, 2> (7, 10)
- <7, 5, 3, 14> (5, 14)

Step 3:
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [12].
