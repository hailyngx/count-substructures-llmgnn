Step 2: Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 1, (6, 9), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 6, (7, 3), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 6, (7, 2), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 8, (2, 7), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, 8, (5, 3), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <0, 12, (2, 7), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <0, 12, (6, 1), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <0, 12, (11, 4), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <1, 6, (7, 2), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <2, 7, (6, 1), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <3, 7, (6, 1), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <3, 7, (2, 12), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <4, 11, (10, 13), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <5, 10, (8, 13), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <13, 9, (8, 0), 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 23 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [15].
