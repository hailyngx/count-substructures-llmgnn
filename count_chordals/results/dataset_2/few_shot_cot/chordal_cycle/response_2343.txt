Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 8, 3, 1, 5)
- Cycle 3: (0, 4, 6, 2, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 4, 8, 5, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 8, 3, 7, 0)
- Cycle 6: (1, 7, 3, 8, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 9, 8, 5, 2)
- Cycle 8: (6, 2, 1, 9, 6)

Step 2: Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 2, 1, 5) <(2, 5)>
- Cycle 2: (5, 8, 3, 1, 5) <(3, 8)>
- Cycle 3: (0, 4, 6, 2, 0) <(2, 6)>
- Cycle 4: (0, 4, 8, 5, 0) <(4, 5)>
- Cycle 7: (2, 9, 8, 5, 2) <(8, 9)>
- Cycle 8: (6, 2, 1, 9, 6) <(1, 6)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are 2 chordless cycles found. 

Therefore, the count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are: 
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 6, 2> 
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 8, 5>
