Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 4, 7, 9, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 4, 7, 6, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 1, 6, 5, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 1, 6, 9, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 1, 0, 9, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 1, 0, 2, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 1, 0, 7, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 1, 0, 2, 8, 7, 3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 9, 7, 8, 6, 5, 3)
- Cycle 10: (6, 5, 3, 9, 6)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (4, 7), 3>: Cycle 1 has one chord (4, 7)
- <2, (4, 7), 3>: Cycle 2 has one chord (4, 7)
- <3, (1, 6), 1>: Cycle 3 has one chord (1, 6)
- <4, (1, 9), 1>: Cycle 4 has one chord (1, 9)
- <5, (1, 9), 0>: Cycle 5 has one chord (1, 9)
- <6, (1, 0), 1>: Cycle 6 has one chord (1, 0)
- <7, (1, 7), 0>: Cycle 7 has one chord (1, 7)
- <8, (1, 7), 8>: Cycle 8 has one chord (1, 7)
- <9, (6, 9), 7>: Cycle 9 has one chord (6, 9)
- <10, (3, 9), 6>: Cycle 10 has one chord (3, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found in total, so the count is [10].
