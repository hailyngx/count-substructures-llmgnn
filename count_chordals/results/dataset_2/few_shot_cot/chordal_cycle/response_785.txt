Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <7, 9, 8, 0, 14, 10, 6, 5> (length 8)
- Cycle 2: <6, 5, 4, 14, 0, 3, 12, 7> (length 8)
- Cycle 3: <1, 13, 8, 0, 10, 6, 2> (length 7)
- Cycle 4: <2, 6, 11, 10, 0> (length 5)
- Cycle 5: <3, 0, 2, 1, 13> (length 5)
- Cycle 6: <4, 5, 12, 7, 9> (length 5)
- Cycle 7: <6, 11, 9, 8, 0> (length 5)
- Cycle 8: <7, 12, 3, 0, 10> (length 5)
- Cycle 9: <8, 14, 4, 5, 6> (length 5)
- Cycle 10: <9, 7, 1, 2, 6> (length 5)
- Cycle 11: <10, 14, 4, 5, 6> (length 5)
- Cycle 12: <11, 6, 2, 0, 10> (length 5)
- Cycle 13: <12, 3, 0, 8, 13> (length 5)
- Cycle 14: <13, 1, 2, 6, 10> (length 5)
- Cycle 15: <14, 0, 3, 12, 7> (length 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <7, 9, 8, 0, 14, 10, 6, 5> has a chord <9, 10>
- <6, 5, 4, 14, 0, 3, 12, 7> has a chord <5, 14>
- <1, 13, 8, 0, 10, 6, 2> has a chord <8, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 12 chordless cycles in the graph, so the final count is [12].
