Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <5, 4, 7, 1, 5>
- <5, 4, 7, 3, 5>
- <5, 4, 6, 1, 5>
- <5, 4, 6, 3, 5>
- <5, 4, 6, 2, 5>
- <5, 9, 4, 7, 5>
- <5, 9, 4, 6, 5>
- <5, 9, 7, 4, 5>
- <5, 9, 7, 3, 5>
- <5, 9, 0, 1, 5>
- <9, 7, 4, 6, 9>
- <9, 7, 3, 6, 9>
- <9, 7, 1, 0, 9>
- <7, 3, 8, 2, 7>
- <7, 1, 0, 9, 7>
- <7, 1, 6, 4, 7>
- <3, 7, 1, 6, 3>
- <3, 7, 4, 6, 3>
- <6, 1, 0, 9, 6>
- <6, 1, 7, 4, 6>
- <6, 3, 7, 4, 6>
- <6, 3, 8, 2, 6>
- <6, 4, 5, 9, 6>
- <6, 4, 7, 9, 6>
- <6, 4, 5, 8, 6>
- <2, 6, 1, 7, 2>
- <2, 6, 3, 8, 2>
- <8, 3, 7, 4, 8>
- <8, 3, 6, 2, 8>
- <8, 1, 0, 9, 8>
- <8, 1, 7, 4, 8>
- <8, 2, 6, 4, 8>
- <0, 1, 7, 4, 0>
- <0, 1, 8, 5, 0>
- <0, 9, 4, 7, 0>
  
Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <5, 4, 6, 1, (5, 8)>.

Step 3: 
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [35].
