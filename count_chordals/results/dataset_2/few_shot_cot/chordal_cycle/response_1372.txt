Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 4, 9, 5>
- <0, 4, 14, 12>
- <0, 8, 3, 12>
- <0, 8, 14, 4>
- <0, 11, 5, 9>
- <1, 5, 9, 7>
- <1, 5, 11, 6>
- <1, 5, 12, 13>
- <1, 7, 11, 6>
- <1, 7, 9, 5>
- <1, 7, 2, 10>
- <2, 5, 9, 7>
- <2, 5, 12, 6>
- <2, 7, 11, 6>
- <2, 7, 9, 5>
- <2, 7, 10, 13>
- <2, 10, 13, 6>
- <3, 8, 0, 4>
- <4, 9, 5, 11>
- <4, 9, 7, 11>
- <4, 9, 2, 5>
- <4, 12, 13, 1>
- <4, 12, 14, 0>
- <5, 9, 7, 11>
- <5, 9, 2, 7>
- <5, 9, 4, 12>
- <5, 12, 13, 1>
- <6, 11, 7, 9>
- <6, 11, 10, 13>
- <6, 11, 5, 2>
- <6, 13, 12, 14>
- <7, 9, 2, 5>
- <7, 9, 5, 11>
- <7, 9, 4, 12>
- <8, 0, 4, 9>
- <9, 5, 11, 0>
- <9, 5, 12, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 5, 9, 7> has the chord (1, 9)
- <4, 9, 5, 11> has the chord (4, 11)
- <7, 9, 2, 5> has the chord (7, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Count [46]
