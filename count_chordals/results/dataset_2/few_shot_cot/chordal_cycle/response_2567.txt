Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 5, 9, 6, 0>
2. <0, 5, 2, 6, 0>
3. <0, 5, 9, 2, 0>
4. <0, 4, 8, 6, 0>
5. <0, 7, 1, 9, 0>
6. <1, 9, 5, 6, 1>
7. <2, 5, 9, 6, 2>
8. <2, 5, 0, 4, 2>
9. <3, 9, 5, 6, 3>
10. <3, 8, 4, 0, 3>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. <0, 5, 9, 6, 0> has a chord: (5, 6)
2. <0, 5, 2, 6, 0> has a chord: (5, 6)
3. <2, 5, 9, 6, 2> has a chord: (5, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
<0, 5, 9, 6>
