Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <6, 9, 3, 7>
2. <6, 9, 7, 5>
3. <9, 11, 12, 5>
4. <11, 1, 7, 9>
5. <8, 6, 9, 11>
6. <8, 6, 13, 4>
7. <8, 6, 13, 12>
8. <8, 10, 11, 1>
9. <13, 12, 4, 14>
10. <5, 6, 9, 7>
11. <5, 7, 9, 11>
12. <7, 9, 11, 2>
13. <7, 1, 2, 11>
14. <12, 11, 2, 14>
15. <0, 11, 2, 13>
16. <0, 5, 7, 9>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
<6, 9, 3, 7> has one chord (9, 7)
<6, 9, 7, 5> has one chord (9, 5)
<9, 11, 12, 5> has one chord (11, 5)
<8, 6, 9, 11> has one chord (6, 11)
<8, 6, 13, 4> has one chord (6, 4)
<8, 6, 13, 12> has one chord (6, 12)
<8, 10, 11, 1> has one chord (10, 11)
<13, 12, 4, 14> has one chord (12, 14)
<7, 9, 11, 2> has one chord (9, 2)
<7, 1, 2, 11> has one chord (1, 11)
<12, 11, 2, 14> has one chord (11, 14)
<0, 11, 2, 13> has one chord (11, 13)

Step 3:
The total number of chordal 4-cycles found is [12].
