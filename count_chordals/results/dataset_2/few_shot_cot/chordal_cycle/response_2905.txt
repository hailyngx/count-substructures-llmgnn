Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 2-1-6-9-5-2
- Cycle 2: 6-1-2-5-8-6
- Cycle 3: 6-8-7-0-2-6
- Cycle 4: 3-7-0-2-5-3
- Cycle 5: 3-7-6-1-2-3
- Cycle 6: 3-6-4-9-5-3
- Cycle 7: 3-9-5-2-0-3
- Cycle 8: 4-5-8-7-6-4
- Cycle 9: 4-6-8-5-9-4
- Cycle 10: 4-9-6-1-2-4

Step 2:
Out of the listed cycles, only Cycle 8: 4-5-8-7-6-4 has exactly one chord: (5, 7)

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <4, (5, 7), 8>
