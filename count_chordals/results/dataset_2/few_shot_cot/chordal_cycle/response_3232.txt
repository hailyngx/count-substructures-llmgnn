Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, (2, 15), 29, (4, 26)>. 
Let's count the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph now:
Step 1: 
- Cycles of length 4: 
    - 0-2-15-29
    - 0-15-18-20
    - 0-4-26-29
    - 0-4-10-13
    - 2-15-18-20
    - 2-15-29-10
    - 4-10-13-18
    - 4-10-19-24
    - 9-12-16-18
    - 9-12-18-13
    - 10-13-18-20
    - 10-13-22-21
    - 11-6-21-22
    - 11-6-21-14
    - 15-2-16-18
    - 15-2-0-20
    - 18-13-22-21
    - 18-13-10-29
    - 18-13-10-4 
Step 2:
- The only cycle with exactly one chord is 0-2-15-29 with chord 4-26.
  
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
