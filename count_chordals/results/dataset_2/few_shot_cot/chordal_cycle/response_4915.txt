Node 8 is connected to node 6, 14, 3, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 12, 13, 8, 4, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 7, 13, and node 3
Node 11 is connected to node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 7, 2, 11, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, 10, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 0, 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. We can list them as follows:
- <5, 7, 12, 6>
- <5, 7, 13, 13>
- <4, 9, 13, 5>
- <4, 5, 10, 3>
- <6, 7, 9, 1>
- <6, 4, 9, 1>
- <0, 4, 9, 1>
- <0, 4, 9, 13>
- <0, 4, 14, 2>
- <0, 6, 7, 5>
- <8, 6, 7, 5>
- <8, 6, 4, 5>
- <8, 6, 4, 9>
- <8, 3, 10, 5>
- <8, 3, 10, 7>

Step 2:
After checking each cycle, we find that the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 14, 2> with chord (4, 14)

Step 3:
Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
