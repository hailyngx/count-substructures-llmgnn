Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 4, 7, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 4, 3, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 2, 9, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 2, 6, 5, 0>
- Cycle 5: <2, 9, 5, 6, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 9, 5, 6, 0, 3, 4, 7, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 0, 1, 2, 9, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle 8: <3, 0, 1, 2, 6, 5, 4, 3>
- Cycle 9: <4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 5, 4>
- Cycle 10: <4, 5, 0, 3, 7, 4>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 5, 4, (7, 3), 0> (Chord: 7-3)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 1, 2, (6, 5), 0> (Chord: 6-5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, 9, 5, (6, 0), 3, 4, 7, 2> (Chords: 6-0)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, 0, 1, 2, (9, 7), 4, 3> (Chord: 9-7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, 0, 1, 2, (6, 5), 4, 3> (Chord: 6-5)

Step 3:
There are [5] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
