Response:
After counting the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, we find that there are a total of [16] chordal 4-cycles. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
1. <0, 3, 14, 11> (chord: (3, 11))
2. <0, 4, 5, 15> (chord: (4, 15))
3. <0, 6, 13, 6> (chord: (6, 13))
4. <1, 4, 5, 15> (chord: (4, 15))
5. <1, 8, 17, 5> (chord: (8, 17))
6. <2, 6, 11, 5> (chord: (6, 11))
7. <2, 6, 13, 6> (chord: (6, 13))
8. <3, 0, 4, 5> (chord: (0, 5))
9. <3, 14, 11, 5> (chord: (14, 11))
10. <5, 11, 14, 1> (chord: (11, 14))
11. <5, 17, 8, 1> (chord: (17, 8))
12. <7, 9, 16, 15> (chord: (9, 16))
13. <7, 10, 12, 15> (chord: (10, 12))
14. <9, 2, 6, 11> (chord: (2, 6))
15. <9, 12, 3, 14> (chord: (12, 3))
16. <16, 15, 12, 3> (chord: (15, 12))
