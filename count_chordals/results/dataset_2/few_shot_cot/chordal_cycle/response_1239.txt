Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 15) (13, 19) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 10) (12, 7) (12, 16) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 9) (2, 3) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 1) (3, 2) (3, 11) (3, 17) (11, 3) (11, 9) (0, 8) (0, 7) (5, 18) (5, 17) (1, 18) (1, 10) (6, 4) (6, 10) (6, 19) (14, 16) (14, 10) (16, 12) (16, 14) (16, 19) (16, 10) (15, 13) (15, 19) (15, 9) (15, 17) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 6) (19, 16) (19, 15) (17, 3) (17, 5) (17, 15) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 15) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 6) (10, 14) (10, 16)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <8, 4, 6, 10>
- <10, 16, 19, 6>
- <19, 15, 9, 2>
- <2, 3, 17, 5>
- <5, 18, 1, 10>
- <10, 7, 12, 16>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
The cycle <8, 4, 6, 10> has exactly one chord 6.
The cycle <10, 16, 19, 6> has exactly one chord 16.
The cycle <19, 15, 9, 2> has exactly one chord 15.
The cycle <2, 3, 17, 5> has exactly one chord 3.
The cycle <5, 18, 1, 10> has exactly one chord 1.
The cycle <10, 7, 12, 16> has exactly one chord 7.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [6].
