Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 5, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 7, 3, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 6, 5, 9, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 9, 7, 8, 2>
- Cycle 6: <3, 6, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 7: <4, 6, 5, 9, 4>
- Cycle 8: <6, 5, 9, 7, 6>
- Cycle 9: <7, 9, 5, 6, 7>
- Cycle 10: <8, 4, 6, 0, 8>

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 5, 6, 0> has chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 7, 3, 0> has chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 3: <1, 6, 5, 9, 1> has chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 4, 8, 1> has chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 5: <2, 9, 7, 8, 2> has chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 6: <3, 6, 4, 8, 3> has chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 7: <4, 6, 5, 9, 4> has chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 8: <6, 5, 9, 7, 6> has chord (5, 7)
- No chord in Cycle 9
- Cycle 10: <8, 4, 6, 0, 8> has chord (4, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 8
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
