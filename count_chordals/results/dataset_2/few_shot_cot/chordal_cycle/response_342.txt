Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 9, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 9, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 6, 5, 2>
- Cycle 4: <7, 9, 1, 2, 5>
- Cycle 5: <3, 0, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 6: <1, 2, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 7: <0, 4, 6, 5, 2>
- Cycle 8: <4, 7, 0, 3, 6>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 1, 9, 7> has a chord (1, 9)
- <0, 4, 7, 9, 1> has a chord (7, 1)
- <0, 3, 6, 5, 2> has a chord (6, 5)
- <7, 9, 1, 2, 5> has a chord (9, 2)
- <3, 0, 4, 6, 5> has a chord (4, 5)
- <1, 2, 5, 8, 9> has a chord (2, 8)
- <0, 4, 6, 5, 2> has a chord (4, 2)
- <4, 7, 0, 3, 6> has a chord (7, 3)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are no chordless cycles found since each cycle has at least one chord.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
