Response:
There are [17] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<10, 5, 1, 11> with non-adjacent chord (3, 14)
<10, 5, 1, 12> with non-adjacent chord (0, 14)
<10, 5, 1, 14> with non-adjacent chord (0, 12)
<10, 2, 4, 9> with non-adjacent chord (8, 9)
<10, 2, 4, 13> with non-adjacent chord (8, 14)
<10, 2, 4, 8> with non-adjacent chord (5, 9)
<11, 1, 5, 10> with non-adjacent chord (3, 4)
<11, 1, 5, 12> with non-adjacent chord (0, 10)
<11, 1, 5, 14> with non-adjacent chord (0, 4)
<11, 9, 4, 2> with non-adjacent chord (8, 13)
<11, 9, 4, 8> with non-adjacent chord (2, 5)
<11, 9, 4, 13> with non-adjacent chord (2, 14)
<3, 7, 1, 11> with non-adjacent chord (9, 14)
