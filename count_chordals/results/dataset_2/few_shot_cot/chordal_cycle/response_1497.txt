Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles with a length of 4 or more in the graph are: 
1. <0, 5, 1, 4, 0>
2. <0, 5, 1, 2, 6, 8, 0>
3. <0, 5, 1, 7, 9, 2, 6, 0>
4. <1, 5, 9, 8, 1>
5. <1, 5, 6, 2, 7, 1>
6. <7, 9, 2, 6, 5, 7>
7. <4, 8, 9, 5, 4>
8. <4, 8, 6, 1, 5, 4>
9. <2, 9, 8, 4, 1, 6, 2>
10. <2, 9, 7, 1, 5, 7, 2>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent nodes connected by an edge) are:
1. <0, 5, 1, 4, 0> (Chord: 1-4)
2. <0, 5, 1, 2, 6, 8, 0> (Chord: 1-6)
3. <0, 5, 1, 7, 9, 2, 6, 0> (Chord: 1-2)
4. <1, 5, 6, 2, 7, 1> (Chord: 6-7)
5. <7, 9, 2, 6, 5, 7> (Chord: 2-5)
6. <4, 8, 9, 5, 4> (Chord: 5-9)
7. <4, 8, 6, 1, 5, 4> (Chord: 6-5)
8. <2, 9, 8, 4, 1, 6, 2> (Chord: 1-4)
9. <2, 9, 7, 1, 5, 7, 2> (Chord: 1-7)

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. 
Therefore, the final count is [9].
