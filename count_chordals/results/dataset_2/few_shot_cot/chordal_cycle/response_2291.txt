Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6)

Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        <0, 5, 9, 4, 0>
        <0, 5, 9, 7, 0>
        <0, 5, 2, 9, 0>
        <0, 9, 5, 2, 0>
        <0, 9, 4, 7, 0>
        <0, 9, 2, 5, 0>
        <1, 4, 9, 7, 1>
        <2, 5, 9, 7, 2>
        <2, 5, 9, 4, 2>
        <2, 5, 0, 9, 2>
        <2, 9, 4, 7, 2>
        <2, 9, 4, 6, 2>
        <2, 9, 5, 0, 2>
        <3, 0, 9, 7, 3>
        <3, 0, 9, 4, 3>
        <3, 0, 6, 4, 3>
        <4, 9, 7, 1, 4>
        <5, 9, 0, 3, 5>
        <5, 9, 4, 0, 5>
        <5, 9, 2, 3, 5>
        <6, 4, 9, 7, 6>
        <6, 4, 7, 1, 6>
        <7, 9, 4, 1, 7>
        <8, 5, 9, 4, 8>
        <8, 5, 2, 9, 8>
        <9, 5, 0, 3, 9>
        <9, 5, 2, 3, 9>

Step 2: Cycles with exactly one chord:
        <0, 5, 9, 4, 0> - Chord: (5, 9)
        <0, 5, 9, 7, 0> - Chord: (5, 9)
        <0, 5, 2, 9, 0> - Chord: (5, 9)
        <1, 4, 9, 7, 1> - Chord: (4, 7)
        <2, 5, 9, 7, 2> - Chord: (5, 9)
        <6, 4, 9, 7, 6> - Chord: (4, 7)
        <7, 9, 4, 1, 7> - Chord: (4, 1)
        <8, 5, 9, 4, 8> - Chord: (5, 9)

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: [8]
