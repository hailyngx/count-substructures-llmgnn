Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 0, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more: 
<0, 5, 1, 4> 
<0, 7, 9, 5> 
<0, 8, 5, 9> 
<0, 4, 6, 2> 
<1, 5, 9, 2> 
<1, 4, 6, 2> 
<2, 9, 5, 8> 
<2, 6, 4, 3> 
<3, 5, 9, 7> 
<3, 4, 0, 8> 

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 5, 1, 4>: Chord (5, 4) 
- <0, 7, 9, 5>: Chord (7, 9) 
- <0, 8, 5, 9>: Chord (8, 9) 
- <0, 4, 6, 2>: Chord (4, 6) 
- <1, 5, 9, 2>: No chord 
- <1, 4, 6, 2>: Chord (1, 6) 
- <2, 9, 5, 8>: Chord (9, 8) 
- <2, 6, 4, 3>: No chord 
- <3, 5, 9, 7>: Chord (5, 9) 
- <3, 4, 0, 8>: Chord (4, 8) 

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 4, 6, 2>
<1, 5, 9, 2>
<3, 4, 0, 8>
