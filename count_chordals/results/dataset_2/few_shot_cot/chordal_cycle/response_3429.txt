Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, 6, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 7, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph, but considering cycles of length 4 or more where every edge in the cycle exists, we can identify the following cycles:
- <5, 9, 3, 6, 5>
- <5, 9, 3, 8, 5>
- <5, 4, 1, 6, 5>
- <5, 4, 1, 9, 5>
- <9, 0, 9, 5, 7>
- <9, 0, 9, 8, 2>
- <9, 1, 4, 6, 9>
- <9, 1, 4, 5, 9>
- <2, 3, 7, 5, 2>
- <2, 3, 8, 9, 2>
- <8, 1, 4, 5, 8>
- <8, 1, 4, 6, 8>
- <0, 9, 5, 7, 0>
- <7, 3, 6, 1, 7>
- <7, 3, 8, 9, 7>

Step 2:
By checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, (4, 9), 1, 6>
- <5, (9, 0), 9, 7>
- <2, (3, 8), 9, 2>
- <1, (4, 6), 3, 8>
- <9, (0, 5), 7, 3> 

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
