Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are as follows:
<0, (2, 12), 10>  
<1, (13, 25), 3>  
<1, (4, 27), 3>  
<1, (24, 16), 27>  
<2, (18, 24), 1>  
<2, (20, 26), 6>  
<3, (25, 9), 22>  
<3, (27, 19), 23>  
<4, (6, 21), 5>  
<4, (27, 16), 24>  
<5, (21, 6), 26>  
<5, (14, 19), 23>  
<6, (26, 20), 2>  
<7, (25, 9), 22>  
<8, (28, 17), 12>  
<9, (22, 23), 19>

<13, (25, 7), 3>  
<14, (19, 27), 4>  
<15, (17, 12), 10>  
<16, (27, 4), 6>  
<17, (28, 8), 2>  
<18, (24, 16), 27>  
<19, (23, 22), 13>  
<20, (26, 6), 4>  
<21, (5, 0), 12>  
<22, (23, 19), 14>  
<23, (19, 27), 4>  
<24, (1, 13), 22>  
<25, (13, 1), 24>  
<26, (6, 21), 5>  
<27, (4, 6), 26>  
<28, (8, 20), 26>  
<29, (23, 19), 14>  

Step 3:
There are 33 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [33].
