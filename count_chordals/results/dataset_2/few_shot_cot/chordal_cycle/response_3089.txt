Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 2, 9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 8, 21, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 11, 22, 25, 10, 4, 18, 27, 14, 13, 24, 11)
- Cycle 4: (3, 2, 28, 21, 17, 13, 24, 5, 1, 9, 2)
- Cycle 5: (4, 18, 27, 10, 3, 1, 9, 2, 17, 13, 24, 11, 1, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 24, 13, 17, 21, 8, 3, 1, 11, 22, 0, 15, 12, 9, 2, 28, 16, 7, 20, 6)

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
- <Cycle 1, (1, 3)>
- <Cycle 2, (1, 3)>
- <Cycle 3, (10, 27)>
- <Cycle 4, (3, 8)>
- <Cycle 5, (18, 27)>
- <Cycle 6, (20, 7)>
- <Cycle 7, (26, 29)>
- <Cycle 8, (16, 28)>
- <Cycle 9, (9, 2)>
- <Cycle 10, (10, 27)>
- <Cycle 11, (18, 27)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
