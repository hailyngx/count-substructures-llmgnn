Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 11, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 7, 3, 10, 4, 9, 1, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 7, 8, 14, 4, 9, 1, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 7, 9, 14, 4, 10, 3, 12, 6, 11, 2, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 7, 3, 12, 13, 11, 6, 2, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 2, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 12, 8, 14, 4, 6, 11, 2, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 2, 11, 13, 12, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 10, 4, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 8: <3, 10, 4, 6, 11, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 12, 8, 7, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycle found (with 1 chord):
- Chordal Cycle 1: <0, 5, 7, 3, 10, 4, 9, 1, 2, 0> (Chord: 1-9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Count of chordless cycles: [7]
