Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 present in the graph:
1. Cycle 0-1-7-5-0
2. Cycle 0-1-9-6-5-0
3. Cycle 0-2-7-5-0
4. Cycle 0-2-9-6-5-0
5. Cycle 0-4-9-6-5-0
6. Cycle 0-4-3-9-6-5-0
7. Cycle 1-3-8-2-7-1
8. Cycle 1-9-6-5-7-1
9. Cycle 2-7-5-6-9-4-2
10. Cycle 2-4-9-6-7-2
11. Cycle 2-8-3-4-0-2
12. Cycle 3-4-9-6-8-3
13. Cycle 4-9-3-8-6-5-4
14. Cycle 5-6-9-4-3-5
15. Cycle 6-9-4-0-2-7-6

Step 2:
From the list of cycles, we can identify the following chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
1. <0, (4, 9), 6, 5>
2. <0, (3, 9), 6, 5>
3. <1, (9, 6), 5, 7>
4. <2, (9, 4), 6, 7>
5. <2, (8, 3), 4, 0>

Step 3:
There are a total of 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [5].
