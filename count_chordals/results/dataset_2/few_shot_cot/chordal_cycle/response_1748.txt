Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 1, 4, 5>  Chord: (0, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 4, 8, 7>  Chord: (4, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 4, 7, 5>  Chord: (4, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 6, 2, 5>  Chord: (6, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 2, 5, 4>  Chord: (2, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <7, 5, 4, 8>  Chord: (5, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 3, 6, 5>  Chord: (3, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the chordal 4-cycles found, which is [7].
