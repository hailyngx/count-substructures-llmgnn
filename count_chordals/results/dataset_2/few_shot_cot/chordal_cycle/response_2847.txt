Response:
Step 1: 
Possible cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. (4, 7, 0, 2, 4)
2. (4, 7, 8, 3, 4)
3. (4, 9, 2, 6, 4)
4. (4, 5, 6, 14, 4)
5. (4, 11, 9, 3, 4)
6. (7, 12, 10, 6, 7)
7. (7, 0, 2, 4, 7)
8. (7, 8, 3, 10, 7)
9. (12, 8, 14, 6, 12)
10. (12, 10, 13, 5, 12)
11. (0, 3, 10, 6, 0)
12. (0, 11, 9, 2, 0)
13. (2, 6, 10, 13, 2)
14. (2, 14, 8, 7, 2)
15. (5, 13, 10, 6, 5)
16. (6, 14, 8, 7, 6)
17. (13, 1, 13)
18. (10, 3, 8, 14, 10)

Step 2: 
Out of the cycles listed above, the cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. (4, 7, 0, 2, 4)   Chord: (4, 2)
2. (4, 9, 2, 6, 4)   Chord: (4, 6)
3. (4, 5, 6, 14, 4)   Chord: (4, 14)
4. (4, 11, 9, 3, 4)   Chord: (4, 9)
5. (7, 12, 10, 6, 7)   Chord: (7, 10)
6. (7, 0, 2, 4, 7)   Chord: (7, 2)
7. (12, 8, 14, 6, 12)   Chord: (12, 14)
8. (12, 10, 13, 5, 12)   Chord: (12, 13)
9. (0, 3, 10, 6, 0)   Chord: (0, 10)
10. (0, 11, 9, 2, 0)   Chord: (0, 9)
11. (2, 6, 10, 13, 2)   Chord: (2, 10)
12. (2, 14, 8, 7, 2)   Chord: (2, 8)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<4, 7, 0, 2>   Chord: (4, 2)
<7, 12, 10, 6>   Chord: (7, 10)
<12, 8, 14, 6>   Chord: (12, 14)
<0, 3, 10, 6>   Chord: (0, 10)
<0, 11, 9, 2>   Chord: (0, 9)
<2, 14, 8, 7>   Chord: (2, 8)
