Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <25, (2, 29), 26, 14)> with the non-adjacent chords 2 and 29 as the chord inside the parentheses.

Following the steps outlined above:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle: 25-2-29-26-25
- Cycle: 25-2-29-7-28-11-3-25
- Cycle: 25-2-29-7-28-19-16-22-29
- Cycle: 25-2-27-7-28-19-16-22-29-25
- Cycle: 25-3-11-28-19-16-22-29-25
- Cycle: 25-1-25 (length 2)
- Cycle: 2-29-22-0-12-4-24-18-10-25-3-23-6-5-8-7-27-9-5 (length 17)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle 25-2-29-26-14 does not have any chords.
- The cycle 25-2-29-26-14 is a chordal 4-cycle with the chords 2 and 29.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There was 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
