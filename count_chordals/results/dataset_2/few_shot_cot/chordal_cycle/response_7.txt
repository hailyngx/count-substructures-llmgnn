Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <0, 5, 17, 1, 16>
        - <4, 8, 6, 9, 5>
        - <4, 8, 6, 10, 13>
        - <4, 16, 1, 17, 3>
        - <8, 6, 9, 5, 2>
        - <8, 6, 9, 17, 3>
        - <8, 19, 2, 5, 14>
        - <9, 5, 0, 14, 15>
        - <9, 5, 14, 0, 2>
        - <9, 4, 8, 19, 16>
        - <9, 4, 16, 1, 17>
        - <9, 18, 3, 17, 1>
        - <10, 6, 8, 19, 16>
        - <10, 6, 9, 5, 0>
        - <10, 6, 9, 17, 1>

        - <14, 5, 9, 6, 10>
        - <16, 4, 8, 6, 10>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Chord in <0, 5, 17, 1, 16>: (5, 17)
        - Chord in <4, 8, 6, 9, 5>: (8, 9)
        - Chord in <4, 8, 6, 10, 13>: (6, 10)
        - Chord in <4, 16, 1, 17, 3>: (1, 17)
        - Chord in <8, 6, 9, 5, 2>: (6, 9)
        - Chord in <8, 6, 9, 17, 3>: (6, 9)
        - Chord in <8, 19, 2, 5, 14>: (2, 5)
        - Chord in <9, 5, 0, 14, 15>: (5, 14)
        - Chord in <9, 5, 14, 0, 2>: (5, 0)
        - Chord in <9, 4, 8, 19, 16>: (8, 19)
        - Chord in <9, 4, 16, 1, 17>: (1, 16)
        - Chord in <9, 18, 3, 17, 1>: (3, 17)
        - Chord in <10, 6, 8, 19, 16>: (6, 8)
        - Chord in <10, 6, 9, 5, 0>: (6, 9)
        - Chord in <10, 6, 9, 17, 1>: (6, 9)
        - Chord in <10, 13, 8, 4, 16>: (8, 16)
        - Chord in <11, 10, 6, 8, 19>: (10, 8)
        - Chord in <12, 11, 10, 6, 9>: (11, 10)
        - Chord in <12, 11, 10, 13, 8>: (10, 13)
        - Chord in <14, 5, 9, 6, 10>: (5, 9)
        - Chord in <16, 4, 8, 6, 10>: (4, 8)
