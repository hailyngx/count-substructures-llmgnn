Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 1, 5, 4, 0>
2. <0, 1, 3, 6, 0>
3. <0, 3, 6, 8, 0>
4. <0, 3, 1, 5, 0>
5. <1, 5, 9, 6, 1>
6. <1, 5, 4, 9, 1>
7. <1, 4, 9, 6, 1>
8. <1, 4, 5, 2, 1>
9. <1, 2, 5, 8, 1>
10. <2, 5, 8, 6, 2>
11. <2, 5, 9, 6, 2>
12. <4, 5, 9, 6, 4>
13. <4, 9, 6, 3, 4>
14. <6, 9, 5, 2, 6>
15. <6, 9, 4, 1, 6>
16. <8, 5, 2, 9, 8>
17. <8, 5, 1, 4, 8>
18. <8, 6, 9, 5, 8>
19. <8, 6, 3, 1, 8>
20. <9, 5, 1, 4, 9>
21. <9, 4, 1, 3, 9>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find that the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 5, 4, 0> with chord (1, 5)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [20].
