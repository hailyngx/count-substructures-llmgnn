Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <2, 14, 9, 8>, with a single chord connecting nodes 9 and 14.

Following the step-by-step approach provided earlier, we can count the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
    - <0, 2, 14, 9>
    - <0, 2, 14, 3>
    - <0, 19, 8, 9>
    - <3, 14, 2, 0>
    - <3, 14, 2, 19>
    - <3, 14, 17, 7>
    - <4, 11, 0, 2>
    - <4, 11, 0, 19>
    - <4, 18, 5, 19>
    - <6, 4, 11, 0>
    - <6, 4, 11, 19>
    - <6, 8, 9, 14>
    - <6, 8, 19, 0>
    - <9, 1, 3, 4>
    - <9, 8, 19, 0>
    - <14, 9, 1, 3>
    - <14, 9, 8, 6>
    - <15, 16, 15, 18>
    - <15, 16, 15, 7>
    - <15, 18, 5, 19>
    - <18, 5, 19, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
    - The only cycle with a chord is <6, 8, 9, 14>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
    - Since all other cycles do not have chords, the count of chordless cycles is [19].
