Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: (6, 4, 7, 5, 6)
- Cycle 2: (9, 2, 7, 4, 9)
- Cycle 3: (9, 7, 4, 8, 9)
- Cycle 4: (9, 7, 5, 8, 9)
- Cycle 5: (3, 6, 4, 8, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 6, 7, 5, 3)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 1, 0, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 8, 3, 2, 4)
- Cycle 9: (5, 8, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 8, 3, 2, 5)
- Cycle 11: (6, 7, 5, 8, 6)
- Cycle 12: (7, 5, 2, 9, 7)
- Cycle 13: (7, 5, 8, 4, 7)
- Cycle 14: (4, 7, 2, 5, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 7, 6, 5, 4)
- Cycle 16: (7, 6, 3, 8, 7)
- Cycle 17: (6, 5, 8, 3, 6)
- Cycle 18: (5, 8, 4, 0, 5)
- Cycle 19: (5, 8, 6, 7, 5)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (3, 2), 5>
- <2, (5, 4), 9>
- <3, (7, 9), 8>
- <4, (1, 0), 8>
- <5, (7, 6), 9>
- <6, (3, 2), 5>
- <7, (6, 4), 5>
- <8, (1, 0), 4>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]
