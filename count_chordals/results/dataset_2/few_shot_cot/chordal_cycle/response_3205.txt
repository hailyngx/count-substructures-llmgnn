- Cycle 24: 9-2-4-8-9
- Cycle 25: 9-7-5-6-9
- Cycle 26: 0-1-3-6-0

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 9: 4-8-6-9-4 <4, 9>
- Cycle 14: 6-8-1-3-6 <1, 3>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [24]

Please check if I made any errors while listing the cycles or finding chords. Let me know if you need any further clarification.
