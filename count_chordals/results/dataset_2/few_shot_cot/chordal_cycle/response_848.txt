Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are two cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. Cycle <1, 5, 4, 6>
2. Cycle <1, 4, 8, 2>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
1. In cycle <1, 5, 4, 6>, the chord is between nodes 5 and 4: <1, (5, 4), 6>
2. In cycle <1, 4, 8, 2>, the chord is between nodes 1 and 8: <1, (1, 8), 2>

Step 3:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [2].
