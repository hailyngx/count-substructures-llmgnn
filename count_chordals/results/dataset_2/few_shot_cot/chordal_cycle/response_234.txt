Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 5, 9, 1> cycle
- <0, 5, 6, 7> cycle
- <0, 5, 3, 1> cycle
- <0, 5, 3, 4> cycle
- <1, 9, 5, 6> cycle
- <1, 9, 7, 4> cycle
- <2, 5, 6, 8> cycle
- <2, 5, 3, 6> cycle
- <2, 5, 3, 1> cycle
- <2, 5, 3, 4> cycle
- <3, 5, 9, 1> cycle
- <3, 5, 6, 7> cycle
- <3, 6, 7, 4> cycle
- <4, 1, 9, 7> cycle
- <4, 1, 3, 7> cycle
- <4, 0, 5, 3> cycle
- <6, 5, 9, 7> cycle

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 5, 9, 1> has a chord (5, 1)
- <0, 5, 6, 7> has no chords
- <0, 5, 3, 1> has a chord (5, 1)
- <0, 5, 3, 4> has a chord (5, 4)
- <1, 9, 5, 6> has a chord (9, 6)
- <1, 9, 7, 4> has a chord (9, 7)
- <2, 5, 6, 8> has no chords
- <2, 5, 3, 6> has no chords
- <2, 5, 3, 1> has no chords
- <2, 5, 3, 4> has no chords
- <3, 5, 9, 1> has a chord (5, 9)
- <3, 5, 6, 7> has a chord (5, 7)
- <3, 6, 7, 4> has a chord (6, 4)
- <4, 1, 9, 7> has a chord (1, 7)
- <4, 1, 3, 7> has a chord (1, 7)
- <4, 0, 5, 3> has a chord (0, 3)
- <6, 5, 9, 7> has a chord (5, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of [8] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
