Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 1, 8, 7, 4, 6> with nodes connected by edges (0, 1), (1, 8), (8, 7), (7, 4), (4, 6), (6, 8)
- Cycle <0, 1, 8, 2, 5, 9> with nodes connected by edges (0, 1), (1, 8), (8, 2), (2, 5), (5, 9), (9, 0)
- Cycle <0, 1, 7, 4, 6, 8> with nodes connected by edges (0, 1), (1, 7), (7, 4), (4, 6), (6, 8), (8, 0)
- Cycle <0, 1, 10, 4, 6, 8> with nodes connected by edges (0, 1), (1, 10), (10, 4), (4, 6), (6, 8), (8, 0)
- Cycle <0, 11, 2, 13, 5, 9> with nodes connected by edges (0, 11), (11, 2), (2, 13), (13, 5), (5, 9), (9, 0)
- Cycle <0, 11, 6, 4, 7, 8> with nodes connected by edges (0, 11), (11, 6), (6, 4), (4, 7), (7, 8), (8, 0)
- Cycle <1, 0, 11, 6, 4, 7> with nodes connected by edges (1, 0), (0, 11), (11, 6), (6, 4), (4, 7), (7, 1)
- Cycle <1, 7, 4, 10, 3, 0> with nodes connected by edges (1, 7), (7, 4), (4, 10), (10, 3), (3, 0), (0, 1)
- Cycle <1, 7, 12, 9, 5, 13> with nodes connected by edges (1, 7), (7, 12), (12, 9), (9, 5), (5, 13), (13, 1)

Step 2:
- The cycle <0, 1, 8, 7, 4, 6> has one chord <7, 8>
- The cycle <0, 1, 8, 2, 5, 9> has one chord <2, 9>
- The cycle <0, 1, 7, 4, 6, 8> has one chord <1, 6>
- The cycle <0, 1, 10, 4, 6, 8> has one chord <4, 8>
- The cycle <0, 11, 2, 13, 5, 9> has one chord <2, 5>
- The cycle <0, 11, 6, 4, 7, 8> has one chord <6, 7>
- The cycle <1, 0, 11, 6, 4, 7> has one chord <4, 6>
- The cycle <1, 7, 4, 10, 3, 0> has one chord <1, 3>
- The cycle <1, 7, 12, 9, 5, 13> has one chord <7, 9>

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so [9].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 1, 8, 7, (4, 6)>
<0, 1, 8, (2, 5), 9>
<0, 1, 7, (4, 6), 8>
<0, 1, (10, 4), 6, 8>
<0, (11, 2), 13, 5, 9>
<0, 11, 6, 4, 7>
<1, 0, 11, 6, 4, 7>
<1, 7, 4, 10, (3, 0)>
<1, 7, 12, 9, 5, 13>
