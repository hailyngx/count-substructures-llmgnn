Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
1. <0, 1, 3, 7>
2. <0, 1, 3, 9>
3. <0, 1, 2, 5>
4. <0, 1, 2, 6>
5. <0, 1, 7, 5>
6. <0, 1, 7, 8>
7. <0, 2, 5, 6>
8. <0, 2, 5, 8>
9. <0, 2, 6, 5>
10. <0, 2, 6, 9>
11. <0, 2, 8, 5>
12. <0, 2, 8, 7>
13. <0, 4, 9, 6>
14. <0, 7, 5, 6>
15. <0, 7, 5, 8>
16. <0, 7, 8, 5>
17. <1, 2, 5, 6>
18. <1, 3, 6, 2>
19. <1, 3, 6, 9>
20. <1, 3, 9, 4>
21. <1, 7, 5, 6>
22. <1, 7, 5, 8>
23. <2, 5, 6, 9>
24. <2, 5, 8, 0>
25. <2, 6, 5, 7>
26. <2, 6, 9, 4>
27. <2, 8, 0, 1>
28. <3, 6, 2, 1>
29. <3, 6, 2, 5>
30. <3, 6, 9, 4>
31. <3, 9, 4, 0>
32. <5, 6, 2, 1>
33. <5, 6, 2, 8>
34. <5, 6, 9, 4>
35. <5, 7, 1, 3>
36. <5, 7, 1, 2>
37. <5, 7, 3, 6>
38. <6, 9, 4, 0>
39. <7, 1, 3, 9>
40. <7, 5, 6, 2>

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord, which are chordal 4-cycles are: 
1. <0, 1, 2, 6>, chord (1, 2)
2. <0, 1, 7, 5>, chord (1, 7)
3. <0, 2, 6, 9>, chord (2, 6)
4. <1, 3, 9, 4>, chord (3, 9)
5. <2, 5, 6, 9>, chord (5, 6)
6. <5, 6, 2, 1>, chord (2, 5)

Step 3: 
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
