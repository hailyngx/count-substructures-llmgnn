Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 9>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 10, 5>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 2, 8>
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 5, 8>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 14, 7>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 2, 8>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 10, 5>
- Cycle 8: <2, 6, 0, 4>
- Cycle 9: <2, 8, 5, 11>
- Cycle 10: <2, 3, 10, 13>
- Cycle 11: <3, 9, 1, 14>
- Cycle 12: <3, 10, 13, 7>
- Cycle 13: <3, 12, 11, 8>
- Cycle 14: <4, 0, 6, 10>
- Cycle 15: <4, 1, 14, 7>

- Cycle 23: <9, 14, 7, 13>
- Cycle 24: <10, 6, 2, 3>
- Cycle 25: <10, 5, 8, 11>
- Cycle 26: <11, 8, 2, 4>
- Cycle 27: <12, 11, 7, 1>
- Cycle 28: <13, 10, 6, 0>
- Cycle 29: <13, 1, 4, 2>

Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycles:
<5, 9, 14, 8> (Chord: (5, 8))
<1, 4, 2, 8> (Chord: (4, 8))
<2, 6, 10, 5> (Chord: (6, 10))
<7, 14, 9, 1> (Chord: (14, 1))

Step 3:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
