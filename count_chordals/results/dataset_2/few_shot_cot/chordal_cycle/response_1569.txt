Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 2, 1, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 8, 9>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 8, 5, 7>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 5, 8>
- Cycle 5: <1, 2, 4, 8>
- Cycle 6: <1, 2, 4, 6>
- Cycle 7: <1, 2, 7, 5>
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 3, 6>
- Cycle 9: <2, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 10: <3, 4, 8, 5>
- Cycle 11: <4, 6, 5, 7>
- Cycle 12: <4, 8, 5, 6>
- Cycle 13: <5, 7, 1, 2>
- Cycle 14: <5, 7, 2, 6>
- Cycle 15: <5, 8, 3, 4>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 2, 1, 7> has one chord: (4, 2)
- <0, 4, 8, 9> has one chord: (4, 8)
- <0, 4, 8, 5, 7> has one chord: (4, 5) 
- <0, 7, 5, 8> has one chord: (7, 5)
- <1, 2, 4, 8> has one chord: (2, 8)
- <1, 2, 4, 6> has one chord: (2, 4)
- <1, 2, 7, 5> has one chord: (2, 7)
- <2, 4, 3, 6> has one chord: (4, 3)
- <2, 4, 6, 5> has one chord: (4, 6)
- <3, 4, 8, 5> has one chord: (4, 8)
- <4, 6, 5, 7> has one chord: (6, 5)
- <4, 8, 5, 6> has one chord: (8, 5)
- <5, 7, 1, 2> has one chord: (7, 1)
- <5, 7, 2, 6> has one chord: (7, 2)
- <5, 8, 3, 4> has one chord: (8, 3)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [15].
