Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 8, 13, 4, 5> with chord (8, 4).
- Cycle <0, 8, 6, 1, 12> with chord (8, 12).
- Cycle <0, 14, 13, 8, 5> with chord (13, 5).
- Cycle <0, 14, 6, 1, 12> with chord (14, 12).
- Cycle <2, 5, 9, 3, 6> with chord (5, 3).
- Cycle <3, 9, 12, 1, 6> with chord (9, 1).
- Cycle <4, 5, 9, 3, 11> with chord (5, 3).
- Cycle <4, 10, 12, 9, 5> with chord (10, 9).
- Cycle <6, 8, 0, 7, 13> with chord (8, 7).
- Cycle <6, 11, 14, 13, 4> with chord (11, 13).
- Cycle <7, 13, 8, 0, 14> with chord (13, 0).
- Cycle <9, 11, 3, 6, 1> with chord (11, 6).
  
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- As seen above, each listed cycle has exactly one chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is given by [11].
