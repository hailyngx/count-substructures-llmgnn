Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph, such as:
1. Cycle 0-6-4-8-0
2. Cycle 0-6-5-4-0
3. Cycle 0-6-8-9-0
4. Cycle 0-6-4-3-2-0
5. Cycle 0-6-5-2-0
6. Cycle 1-5-4-2-1
7. Cycle 1-5-2-0-1
8. Cycle 2-3-4-5-2
9. Cycle 4-6-5-2-4
10. Cycle 5-6-7-0-5
11. Cycle 6-5-7-0-6
12. Cycle 6-4-8-9-6
13. Cycle 8-4-5-7-8
14. Cycle 8-9-1-5-8

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 0-6-4-8-0 has chord 4-8
- Cycle 0-6-5-4-0 has chord 5-4
- Cycle 1-5-4-2-1 has chord 1-4
- Cycle 2-3-4-5-2 has chord 2-4
- Cycle 4-6-5-2-4 has chord 5-2
- Cycle 5-6-7-0-5 has chord 6-7
- Cycle 6-4-8-9-6 has chord 4-9

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have 7 chordal 4-cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 4, 8, (4, 8), 6>
<0, 5, 4, (5, 4), 6>
<1, 5, 4, (1, 4), 2>
<2, 3, 4, (2, 4), 5>
<4, 6, 5, (5, 2), 4>
<5, 6, 7, (6, 7), 5>
<6, 4, 8, (4, 9), 6>
