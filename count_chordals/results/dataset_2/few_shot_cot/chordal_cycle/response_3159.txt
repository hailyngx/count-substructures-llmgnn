Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 9, 5>
- <0, 4, 2, 10>
- <0, 4, 9, 6>
- <0, 10, 1, 9>
- <0, 10, 2, 4>
- <0, 10, 13, 6>
- <0, 12, 11, 9>
- <1, 0, 4, 9>
- <1, 0, 10, 2>
- <1, 9, 5, 7>
- <2, 4, 9, 5>
- <2, 4, 10, 1>
- <2, 4, 9, 11>
- <2, 10, 0, 4>
- <2, 10, 13, 6>
- <2, 12, 11, 9>
- <3, 8, 10, 13>
- <3, 14, 6, 9>
- <3, 14, 7, 11>
- <4, 9, 6, 13>
- <6, 9, 5, 7>
- <7, 5, 9, 1>
- <7, 11, 12, 0>
- <9, 5, 7, 14>
- <10, 0, 4, 9>
- <10, 0, 12, 11>
- <10, 1, 9, 5>
- <11, 9, 6, 13>
  
Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <1, (0, 4), 9>

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles = [29]
