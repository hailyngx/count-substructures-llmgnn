Response:
Step 1: 
We need to find all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <5, 14, 6, 2, 17, 1> of length 5
- Cycle <5, 14, 11, 3, 12, 19> of length 5
- Cycle <5, 14, 11, 3, 12, 8> of length 5
- Cycle <5, 11, 3, 12, 8, 10> of length 5
- Cycle <5, 19, 16, 7, 1, 4> of length 5
- Cycle <5, 19, 16, 0, 12, 8> of length 5

Step 2:
- Checking for a single chord in each cycle: 
    - <5, 14, 6, 2, 17, 1> has a chord (2, 17)
    - <5, 14, 11, 3, 12, 19> has a chord (3, 19)
    - <5, 14, 11, 3, 12, 8> has a chord (3, 8)
    - <5, 11, 3, 12, 8, 10> has a chord (3, 10)
    - <5, 19, 16, 7, 1, 4> has a chord (7, 4)
    - <5, 19, 16, 0, 12, 8> has a chord (0, 8)

Step 3:
- Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found: [6] 

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<5, 14, 6, (2, 17), 1>
<5, 14, 11, (3, 19), 12>
<5, 14, 11, (3, 8), 12>
<5, 11, 3, (12, 8), 10>
<5, 19, 16, 7, (1, 4)>
<5, 19, 16, 0, (12, 8)>
