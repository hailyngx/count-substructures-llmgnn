Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 4, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (3, 1, 6, 4, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 1, 5, 7, 3)
- Cycle 5: (0, 1, 5, 8, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Checking Cycle 1: (5, 1, 6, 9, 5) has a chord (1, 9). So, this is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Checking Cycle 2: (5, 7, 4, 6, 5) has a chord (7, 6). So, this is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Checking Cycle 3: (3, 1, 6, 4, 3) has a chord (1, 4). So, this is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Checking Cycle 4: (3, 1, 5, 7, 3) has a chord (1, 7). So, this is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Checking Cycle 5: (0, 1, 5, 8, 0) has a chord (1, 8). So, this is not a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph. 
- Thus, the final answer is [0].
