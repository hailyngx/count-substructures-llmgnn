Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges are as follows:
- Cycle: <2, 7, 9, 5, 2>
- Cycle: <2, 24, 6, 22, 20, 9, 7, 2>
- Cycle: <2, 7, 9, 20, 18, 15, 18, 20, 22, 6, 24, 2>
- Cycle: <4, 26, 13, 11, 0, 28, 16, 25, 3, 2, 24, 17, 26, 4>
- Cycle: <4, 26, 13, 11, 0, 28, 16, 25, 3, 2, 24, 6, 22, 20, 9, 5, 8, 28, 0, 11, 21, 12, 27, 14, 24, 17, 26, 4>
- Cycle: <4, 26, 17, 24, 14, 27, 12, 21, 11, 7, 9, 5, 8, 28, 16, 25, 3, 2, 24, 6, 22, 20, 9, 5>
- Cycle: <5, 9, 7, 11, 13, 26, 4, 27, 14, 24, 17, 23, 19, 13, 11, 7, 2>
- Cycle: <5, 9, 20, 18, 15, 18, 20, 22, 6, 24, 14, 27, 12, 21, 11, 0, 28, 16, 25, 3, 2>
- Cycle: <5, 9, 20, 18, 15, 18, 20, 22, 6, 24, 17, 26, 13, 19, 23, 17, 24, 14, 27, 12, 21, 11, 7, 2>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle (4-cycle with exactly one chord) is:
- Unique chordal 4-cycle: <4, 26, 13, 11, (0, 28), 16, 25, 3, 2>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [8].
