Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- (0, 5, 1, 3, 0)
- (0, 5, 9, 4, 0)
- (0, 5, 9, 3, 0)
- (0, 9, 4, 8, 0)
- (0, 9, 2, 7, 0)
- (1, 5, 9, 3, 1)
- (1, 5, 6, 2, 1)
- (1, 5, 0, 3, 1)
- (1, 6, 2, 7, 1)
- (2, 9, 4, 8, 2)
- (2, 9, 3, 7, 2)
- (2, 7, 8, 4, 2)
- (3, 9, 4, 8, 3)
- (4, 9, 5, 6, 4)
- (5, 9, 3, 1, 5)
- (6, 5, 9, 4, 6)
- (7, 3, 9, 5, 7)
- (8, 4, 9, 5, 8)

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle is: <0, (2, 8), 4>
This 4-cycle has only one chord, which is the edge connecting nodes 2 and 8.

Step 3:
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
