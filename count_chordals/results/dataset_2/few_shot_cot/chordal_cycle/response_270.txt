Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 5, 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 5, 8, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 8, 6, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 1, 5, 8, 2>
- Cycle 7: <2, 1, 5, 4, 2>
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 4, 9, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 5, 8, 6, 3>
- Cycle 10: <4, 5, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle 11: <6, 5, 8, 0, 6>
- Cycle 12: <7, 6, 5, 1, 7>
- Cycle 13: <7, 6, 5, 4, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 1, 5, 4, 0> has a chord (1, 4), making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, the graph contains one unique chordal 4-cycle: <0, (1, 4), 5>.
