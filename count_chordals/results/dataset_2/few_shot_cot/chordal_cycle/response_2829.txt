Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 5, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 3, 9, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 4, 3, 7, 2>
- Cycle 5: <3, 9, 7, 5, 3>
- Cycle 6: <5, 1, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 7: <6, 2, 5, 7, 6>
- Cycle 8: <7, 8, 3, 4, 7>
  
Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 6 has a chord: <6, (1, 4), 5>
- Cycle 7 has a chord: <7, (2, 5), 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
As cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 do not have chords, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
