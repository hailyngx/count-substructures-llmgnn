Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: 0-1-2-3-0 (with chord 1-3)
        - Cycle 2: 0-1-4-5-0 (with chord 1-5)
        - Cycle 3: 0-2-8-9-0 (with chord 2-9)
        - Cycle 4: 0-3-4-5-0 (with chord 3-5)
        - Cycle 5: 2-1-4-3-2 (with chord 1-3)
        - Cycle 6: 2-0-3-8-2 (with chord 0-8)
        - Cycle 7: 2-1-0-9-2 (with chord 1-9)
        - Cycle 8: 4-5-9-8-4 (with chord 5-8)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycles: <0, (1, 3), 2>, <0, (1, 5), 4>, <0, (2, 9), 3>, <0, (3, 5), 4>, <1, (1, 3), 4>, <2, (0, 8), 3>, <2, (1, 9), 0>, <4, (5, 8), 9>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        - The number of chordal 4-cycles is [8].
