Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 3, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 2, 5, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 2, 5, 7, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 4, 6, 7, 2>
- Cycle 5: <4, 5, 8, 9, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 2 has chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 3 has chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 4 has chord (4, 6)
- Cycle 5 has chord (5, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
