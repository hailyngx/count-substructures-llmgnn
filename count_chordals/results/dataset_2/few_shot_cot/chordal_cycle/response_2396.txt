Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 11, 6, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 13, 1, 11, 6, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 0, 3, 1, 13, 5>
- Cycle 4: <9, 7, 12, 4, 8, 9>
- Cycle 5: <9, 11, 3, 0, 10, 7, 9>
- Cycle 6: <4, 8, 3, 12, 7, 4>
- Cycle 7: <7, 10, 0, 3, 12, 7>
- Cycle 8: <1, 3, 8, 2, 6, 1>
- Cycle 9: <13, 1, 3, 12, 4, 13>
- Cycle 10: <0, 3, 8, 14, 10, 0>
- Cycle 11: <2, 8, 4, 14, 10, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 11, 6, 5> has one chord (9, 6).
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 13, 1, 11, 6, 5> has one chord (13, 1).
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <9, 11, 3, 0, 10, 7, 9> has one chord (11, 0).
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, 10, 0, 3, 12, 7> has one chord (10, 3).
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, 3, 8, 2, 6, 1> has one chord (3, 2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
