Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle <0, 4, 10, 1> with edges (0, 4), (4, 10), (10, 1), and (1, 0)
- Cycle <0, 14, 2, 13> with edges (0, 14), (14, 2), (2, 13), and (13, 0)
- Cycle <4, 2, 14, 1> with edges (4, 2), (2, 14), (14, 1), and (1, 4)
- Cycle <5, 12, 8, 5> with edges (5, 12), (12, 8), (8, 5), and (5, 5)
- Cycle <5, 13, 9, 3> with edges (5, 13), (13, 9), (9, 3), and (3, 5)
- Cycle <6, 10, 4, 0> with edges (6, 10), (10, 4), (4, 0), and (0, 6)
- Cycle <7, 10, 4, 0> with edges (7, 10), (10, 4), (4, 0), and (0, 7)
- Cycle <8, 11, 9, 3> with edges (8, 11), (11, 9), (9, 3), and (3, 8)
- Cycle <12, 10, 4, 0> with edges (12, 10), (10, 4), (4, 0), and (0, 12)
- Cycle <13, 2, 14, 1> with edges (13, 2), (2, 14), (14, 1), and (1, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <0, 4, 10, 1> has chord (4, 1)
- <0, 14, 2, 13> has chord (14, 13)
- <4, 2, 14, 1> has chord (2, 1)
- <5, 12, 8, 5> has chord (12, 8)
- <5, 13, 9, 3> has chord (13, 9)
- <6, 10, 4, 0> has chord (10, 0)
- <7, 10, 4, 0> has chord (10, 4)
- <8, 11, 9, 3> has chord (11, 9)
- <12, 10, 4, 0> has chord (10, 4)
- <13, 2, 14, 1> has chord (2, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found.

Thus, the final count is [0].
