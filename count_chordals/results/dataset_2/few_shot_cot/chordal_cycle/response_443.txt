Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-8-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-9-4-7-5-0
- Cycle 3: 0-2-9-7-5-0
- Cycle 4: 1-3-6-2-1
- Cycle 5: 2-8-1-3-2
- Cycle 6: 2-8-6-1-2
- Cycle 7: 4-9-7-5-4
- Cycle 8: 5-7-9-4-5

Step 2: 
Chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 1, 8, 6> (0-1-8-6-0) Chord: (1, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 1, 9, 4> (0-1-9-4-7-5-0) Chord: (1, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 1, 9, 7> (0-1-9-4-7-5-0) Chord: (1, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 1, 9, 5> (0-1-9-4-7-5-0) Chord: (1, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, 2, 9, 7> (0-2-9-7-5-0) Chord: (2, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <0, 2, 9, 5> (0-2-9-7-5-0) Chord: (2, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, 3, 6, 2> (1-3-6-2-1) Chord: (3, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, 3, 6, 8> (1-3-6-2-1) Chord: (3, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <1, 2, 8, 6> (2-8-6-1-2) Chord: (2, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <1, 2, 8, 1> (2-8-1-3-2) Chord: (2, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <5, 7, 9, 4> (5-7-9-4-5) Chord: (5, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <5, 7, 9, 5> (5-7-9-4-5) Chord: (5, 7)

Step 3:
There are 12 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
Therefore, the final count is [12].
