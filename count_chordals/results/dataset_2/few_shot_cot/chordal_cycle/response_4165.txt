Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <11, (12, 27), 22, 23>.

First, let's list all cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 0-7-21-26-0
- Cycle 2: 0-7-18-5-0
- Cycle 3: 0-1-11-28-29-14-12-27-22-9-24-19-6-10-0
- Cycle 4: 1-11-23-15-25-8-14-29-27-12-23-11  
- Cycle 5: 2-3-24-19-6-10-14-29-27-22-23-15-25-2
- Cycle 6: 2-3-24-9-13-17-26-21-7-0-2
- Cycle 7: 2-25-15-23-12-27-22-9-24-3-2
- Cycle 8: 4-17-13-9-24-3-2-26-21-7-18-5-25-15-20-12-14-8-25-2

Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has no chord.
- Cycle 8 has a chord, which is the edge (12, 27).

Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle found with a chord, the final count is [1].
