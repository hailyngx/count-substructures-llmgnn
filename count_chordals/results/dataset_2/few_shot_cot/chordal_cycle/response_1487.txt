Response:
Step 1:  
        There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, and all of them are listed below:
        1. Cycle <0, 13, 16, 12>
        2. Cycle <0, 13, 16, 14>
        3. Cycle <1, 8, 16, 14>
        4. Cycle <2, 11, 19, 4>
        5. Cycle <3, 13, 16, 14>
        6. Cycle <3, 13, 16, 12>
        7. Cycle <3, 13, 0, 6>
        8. Cycle <3, 4, 17, 15>
        9. Cycle <4, 17, 15, 14>
        10. Cycle <4, 17, 15, 18>
        11. Cycle <4, 19, 11, 5>
        12. Cycle <4, 19, 11, 2>
        13. Cycle <5, 10, 12, 16>
        14. Cycle <5, 10, 12, 15>
        15. Cycle <6, 8, 16, 14>
        16. Cycle <6, 8, 16, 13>
        17. Cycle <7, 8, 16, 14>
        18. Cycle <7, 8, 16, 13>
        19. Cycle <7, 15, 18, 12>

    Step 2:
        Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle <0, 13, 16, 12> has chord (16, 13)
        - Cycle <0, 13, 16, 14> has chord (16, 13)
        - Cycle <1, 8, 16, 14> has chord (8, 16)
        - Cycle <2, 11, 19, 4> has chord (11, 19)
        - Cycle <3, 13, 16, 14> has chord (16, 13)
        - Cycle <3, 13, 16, 12> has chord (16, 13)
        - Cycle <3, 13, 0, 6> has chord (13, 0)
        - Cycle <3, 4, 17, 15> has chord (4, 17)
        - Cycle <4, 17, 15, 14> has chord (17, 15)
        - Cycle <4, 17, 15, 18> has chord (17, 15)
        - Cycle <4, 19, 11, 5> has chord (19, 11)
        - Cycle <4, 19, 11, 2> has chord (11, 19)
        - Cycle <5, 10, 12, 16> has chord (12, 10)
        - Cycle <5, 10, 12, 15> has chord (12, 10)
        - Cycle <6, 8, 16, 14> has chord (8, 16)
        - Cycle <6, 8, 16, 13> has chord (8, 16)
        - Cycle <7, 8, 16, 14> has chord (8, 16)
        - Cycle <7, 8, 16, 13> has chord (8, 16)
        - Cycle <7, 15, 18, 12> has chord (15, 18)

    Step 3:
        Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
        Total number of chordal 4-cycles = [18]
