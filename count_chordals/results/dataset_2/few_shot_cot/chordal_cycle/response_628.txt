Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <4, 7, 5, 1>
2. <1, 5, 9, 8>
3. <8, 9, 5, 1>
4. <4, 7, 6, 1>
5. <0, 9, 8, 6>
6. <6, 4, 7, 5>
7. <3, 5, 9, 1>
8. <1, 6, 4, 0>
9. <4, 6, 1, 5>
10. <5, 3, 4, 7>
11. <7, 4, 6, 1>
12. <1, 4, 7, 6>
13. <6, 1, 5, 9>
14. <8, 9, 0, 4>
15. <0, 4, 7, 6>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chord in <4, 7, 5, 1>: (4, 1)
- Chord in <1, 5, 9, 8>: (1, 8)
- Chord in <8, 9, 5, 1>: (8, 1)
- Chord in <4, 7, 6, 1>: (4, 6)
- Chord in <0, 9, 8, 6>: (0, 8)
- Chord in <6, 4, 7, 5>: (6, 7)
- Chord in <3, 5, 9, 1>: (3, 9)
- Chord in <1, 6, 4, 0>: (1, 0)
- Chord in <4, 6, 1, 5>: (4, 5)
- Chord in <5, 3, 4, 7>: (5, 4)
- Chord in <7, 4, 6, 1>: (7, 6)
- Chord in <1, 4, 7, 6>: (1, 7)
- Chord in <6, 1, 5, 9>: (6, 5)
- Chord in <8, 9, 0, 4>: (8, 4)
- Chord in <0, 4, 7, 6>: (0, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0] 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
