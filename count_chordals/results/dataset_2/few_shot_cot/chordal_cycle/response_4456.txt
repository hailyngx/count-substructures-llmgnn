Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <5, (11, 15), 2, 6)> with one non-adjacent chord 15 connecting nodes 11 and 2. 

Following the steps mentioned earlier:

Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: (5, 11, 15, 2) with edges (5, 11), (11, 15), (15, 2), (2, 5)
- Cycle 2: (8, 6, 9, 4) with edges (8, 6), (6, 9), (9, 4), (4, 8)
- Cycle 3: (8, 6, 9, 2) with edges (8, 6), (6, 9), (9, 2), (2, 8)
- Cycle 4: (1, 12, 7, 14) with edges (1, 12), (12, 7), (7, 14), (14, 1)
- Cycle 5: (16, 0, 13, 4) with edges (16, 0), (0, 13), (13, 4), (4, 16)
- Cycle 6: (16, 0, 13, 3) with edges (16, 0), (0, 13), (13, 3), (3, 16)
- Cycle 7: (6, 9, 4, 13) with edges (6, 9), (9, 4), (4, 13), (13, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 8, 12, 7) with edges (6, 8), (8, 12), (12, 7), (7, 6)
- Cycle 9: (12, 7, 14, 17) with edges (12, 7), (7, 14), (14, 17), (17, 12)
- Cycle 10: (15, 11, 14, 17) with edges (15, 11), (11, 14), (14, 17), (17, 15)
- Cycle 11: (2, 9, 4, 11) with edges (2, 9), (9, 4), (4, 11), (11, 2)
- Cycle 12: (2, 15, 11, 4) with edges (2, 15), (15, 11), (11, 4), (4, 2)
- Cycle 13: (2, 15, 5, 11) with edges (2, 15), (15, 5), (5, 11), (11, 2)
- Cycle 14: (0, 13, 3, 19) with edges (0, 13), (13, 3), (3, 19), (19, 0)
