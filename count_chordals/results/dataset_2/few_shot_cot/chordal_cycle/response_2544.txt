Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 16) (9, 5) (9, 14) (1, 3) (1, 16) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 16) (3, 8) (8, 3) (8, 13) (8, 15) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 10) (13, 19) (4, 2) (2, 4) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 6) (18, 2) (18, 19) (18, 10) (18, 17) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (10, 13) (10, 18) (10, 16) (15, 8) (19, 13) (19, 2) (19, 18) (19, 14) (7, 16) (7, 17) (16, 5) (16, 1) (16, 3) (16, 10) (16, 7) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 19) (6, 2) (6, 17) (6, 0) (17, 18) (17, 7) (17, 6) (0, 11) (0, 6) (0, 12) (12, 8) (12, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 11, 6, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 16
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 18, 19, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 11, 16, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 16
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 17, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 16, and node 17
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 13, 15, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 13, 18, and node 16
Node 11 is connected to node 3, 14, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 10, and node 19
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 11, and node 19
Node 15 is connected to node 8
Node 16 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 10, and node 7
Node 17 is connected to node 18, 7, and node 6
Node 18 is connected to node 2, 19, 10, and node 17
Node 19 is connected to node 13, 2, 18, and node 14

Response:
Step 1: 
- Nodes 3, 5, 16, 1 form a cycle: <3, 5, 16, 1>
- Nodes 3, 5, 9, 14 form a cycle: <3, 5, 9, 14>
- Nodes 3, 16, 7, 17 form a cycle: <3, 16, 7, 17>
- Nodes 2, 4, 18, 19 form a cycle: <2, 4, 18, 19>
- Nodes 2, 18, 17, 6 form a cycle: <2, 18, 17, 6>
- Nodes 0, 6, 17, 7 form a cycle: <0, 6, 17, 7>
- Nodes 0, 11, 14, 19 form a cycle: <0, 11, 14, 19>

Step 2:
The only cycle with exactly one chord is <3, 5, 9, 14>.

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, so the final count is [1].
