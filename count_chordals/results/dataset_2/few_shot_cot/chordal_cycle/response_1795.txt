Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 1, 3, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 3, 0, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 0, 4, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 3, 1, 2, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 3, 0, 4, 5>
- Cycle 6: <5, 7, 8, 4, 5>
- Cycle 7: <5, 7, 6, 4, 5>
- Cycle 8: <9, 1, 2, 3, 9>
- Cycle 9: <9, 1, 3, 5, 9>
- Cycle 10: <9, 0, 2, 3, 9>
- Cycle 11: <9, 0, 4, 5, 9>
- Cycle 12: <1, 3, 0, 2, 1>
- Cycle 13: <1, 3, 5, 7, 1>
- Cycle 14: <4, 0, 2, 3, 4>
- Cycle 15: <4, 0, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 16: <8, 0, 2, 3, 8>
- Cycle 17: <8, 0, 6, 7, 8>
- Cycle 18: <6, 0, 2, 1, 6>
- Cycle 19: <6, 0, 4, 8, 6>

Step 2: 
Checking for the cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 1, 3, 5> has a chord (1, 3) - Chordal 4-cycle <5, (1, 3), 9>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 3, 0, 5> has a chord (9, 0) - Chordal 4-cycle <5, (0, 9), 3>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 0, 4, 5> has a chord (0, 4) - Chordal 4-cycle <5, (0, 4), 9>
- Cycle 5: <5, 3, 0, 4, 5> has a chord (3, 4) - Chordal 4-cycle <5, (3, 4), 0>
- Cycle 13: <1, 3, 5, 7, 1> has a chord (3, 7) - Chordal 4-cycle <1, (3, 7), 5>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles = [5]
