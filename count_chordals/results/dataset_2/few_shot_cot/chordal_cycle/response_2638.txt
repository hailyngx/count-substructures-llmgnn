Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<1, 4, 7, 10>, 
<2, 9, 14, 4>, 
<3, 1, 4, 12>, 
<2, 9, 1, 4, 11>, 
<5, 1, 3, 7>, 
<3, 7, 10, 14>, 
<3, 1, 10, 14>, 
<6, 3, 7, 10>, 
<2, 8, 11, 14>, 
<2, 8, 13, 7>, 
<2, 11, 14, 10>, 
<11, 8, 13, 10>, 
<1, 5, 2, 12>, 
<11, 14, 9, 10>, 
<12, 4, 14, 11>, 
<7, 10, 14, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<1, 4, (14), 10>, 
<2, (9), 14, 4>, 
<3, 1, 4, 12>, 
<2, 9, 1, (11, 4)>, 
<5, 1, (3, 7), 7>, 
<3, (7), 10, 14>, 
<3, 1, 10, (14)>, 
<6, (3), 7, 10>, 
<2, (8), 11, 14>, 
<2, 8, 13, (7)>, 
<2, 11, 14, (10)>, 
<11, 8, (13), 10>, 
<1, 5, 2, (12)>, 
<11, 14, 9, (10)>, 
<12, 4, (14), 11>, 
<7, 10, (14), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [5] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
