Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- <0, 16, 17, 0>
- <0, 16, 11, 18, 9>
- <0, 16, 17, 7, 2>
- <0, 19, 15, 1, 12>
- <2, 3, 15, 1, 12>
- <2, 3, 17, 0, 16>
- <3, 15, 1, 12, 19>
- <3, 15, 7, 17, 0>
- <3, 17, 0, 16, 11>
- <4, 17, 0, 16, 11>
- <5, 3, 15, 1, 12>
- <5, 3, 17, 7, 2>
- <7, 17, 16, 11, 18>
- <9, 5, 3, 10, 12>
- <11, 16, 0, 19, 12>
- <15, 3, 17, 16, 11>
- <17, 0, 19, 15, 3>
- <18, 11, 16, 0, 19>
- <18, 11, 16, 17, 7>
- <19, 0, 16, 11, 18>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, 16, (17), 0>
- <0, 16, (11, 18), 9>
- <0, 19, (15, 1), 12>
- <2, 3, (15, 1), 12>
- <2, 3, (17, 0), 16>
- <3, 17, (0, 16), 11>
- <4, 17, (0, 16), 11>
- <5, 3, (15, 1), 12>
- <5, 3, (17, 7), 2>
- <7, 17, (16, 11), 18>
- <9, 5, (3, 10), 12>
- <11, 16, (0, 19), 12>
- <15, 3, (17, 16), 11>
- <17, 0, (19, 15), 3>
- <18, 11, (16, 0), 19>
