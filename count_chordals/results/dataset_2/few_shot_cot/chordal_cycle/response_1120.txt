Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 1, 2, 0> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 11, 7, 6, 3, 1, 2, 0> 
- Cycle 3: <1, 9, 11, 7, 6, 3, 1> 
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, 7, 6, 3, 1> 
- Cycle 5: <1, 2, 7, 6, 4, 13, 0, 9, 1> 
- Cycle 6: <1, 2, 7, 14, 8, 4, 13, 0, 1> 
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 6, 7, 11, 9, 1> 
- Cycle 8: <1, 3, 6, 7, 11, 9, 10, 8, 1> 
- Cycle 9: <1, 3, 8, 4, 6, 7, 14, 8, 1> 
- Cycle 10: <1, 5, 12, 8, 14, 10, 9, 1> 
- Cycle 11: <1, 8, 4, 6, 7, 11, 12, 8, 1> 
- Cycle 12: <1, 8, 12, 11, 7, 6, 4, 13, 1> 
- Cycle 13: <1, 8, 12, 11, 7, 14, 10, 9, 1> 
- Cycle 14: <1, 8, 14, 10, 9, 11, 7, 2, 1>

- Cycle 16: <1, 8, 14, 12, 2, 7, 6, 3, 1> 
- Cycle 17: <1, 8, 14, 7, 6, 4, 13, 2, 1> 
- Cycle 18: <3, 1, 2, 7, 6, 4, 13, 0, 3> 
- Cycle 19: <3, 6, 7, 11, 9, 10, 8, 4, 3>

- Cycle 22: <4, 8, 14, 10, 9, 11, 7, 2, 4> 

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, 8, 12, 11, 7, 6, 4, 13, 1> 
- <1, 8, 14, 10, 9, 11, 7, 2, 1> 

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
