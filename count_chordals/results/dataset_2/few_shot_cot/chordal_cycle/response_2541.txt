Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, (9, 17), 1> - Chord: (9, 17)
- <1, (9, 4), 12, 19, 0, 16, 5, 14, 7> - Chord: (9, 4)
- <1, (9, 18), 15, 18, 1> - Chord: (9, 18)
- <1, 11, (13, 2), 4, 9> - Chord: (13, 2)
- <1, 14, (7, 6), 17, 9> - Chord: (7, 6)
- <2, 13, (9, 17), 6, 7, 14, 5> - Chord: (9, 17)
- <4, (12, 8), 18, 15, 18, 1, 11> - Chord: (12, 8)
- <5, 14, (7, 6), 17, 9, 4, 12> - Chord: (7, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [12]
