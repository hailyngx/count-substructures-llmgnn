Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <5, (7, 4), 9>.

Following the steps provided earlier:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 7 - 4 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 14 - 13 - 11 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 14 - 0 - 13 - 5
- Cycle 4: 4 - 7 - 5 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 5: 4 - 7 - 1 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 6: 4 - 7 - 1 - 11 - 4
- Cycle 7: 4 - 9 - 1 - 6 - 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- The cycle <5, (7, 4), 9> has exactly one chord 7 - 4.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- The chordal 4-cycle with one chord is counted as 1, so the final count is [1].
