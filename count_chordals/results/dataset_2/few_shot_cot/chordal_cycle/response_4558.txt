Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 2, 9, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 6, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 6, 5, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 4, 6, 5, 2>
- Cycle 4: <3, 5, 6, 4, 3>
- Cycle 5: <4, 1, 8, 9, 4>
- Cycle 6: <5, 1, 8, 9, 5>
- Cycle 7: <9, 4, 6, 5, 9>
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 0, 9, 2>
- Cycle 9: <3, 5, 2, 0, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 5, 6, 0, 3>
- Cycle 11: <2, 1, 8, 9, 2>
- Cycle 12: <1, 4, 0, 9, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Among the listed cycles, only Cycle 8: <2, 4, 0, 9, 2> has a single chord (connecting non-adjacent nodes 4 and 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- The number of chordless cycles found is [11]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, (4, 9), 0, 2>
