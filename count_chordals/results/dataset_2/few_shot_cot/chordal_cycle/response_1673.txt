Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 4, 6, 2>
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 5, 6, 4>
- Cycle 3: <1, 8, 6, 5, 3>
- Cycle 4: <3, 5, 6, 1, 0>
- Cycle 5: <4, 6, 5, 3, 9>
- Cycle 6: <5, 6, 1, 8, 9>
- Cycle 7: <6, 8, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 8: <7, 9, 8, 6, 5>
- Cycle 9: <8, 6, 4, 2, 5>
- Cycle 10: <9, 8, 1, 4, 0>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- In Cycle 1, no chord found.
- In Cycle 2, no chord found.
- In Cycle 3, no chord found.
- In Cycle 4, no chord found.
- In Cycle 5, no chord found.
- In Cycle 6, no chord found.
- In Cycle 7, no chord found.
- In Cycle 8, no chord found.
- In Cycle 9, no chord found.
- In Cycle 10, no chord found.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [10]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 1, 4, 6, 2>.
