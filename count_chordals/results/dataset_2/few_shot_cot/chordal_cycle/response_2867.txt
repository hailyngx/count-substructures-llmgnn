Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 3, 1, 7>  (Cycle of length 4)
- <0, 3, 9, 2>  (Cycle of length 4)
- <0, 3, 6, 13>  (Cycle of length 4)
- <0, 5, 8, 6>  (Cycle of length 4)
- <1, 7, 4, 10>  (Cycle of length 4)
- <1, 3, 2, 9>  (Cycle of length 4)
- <1, 7, 12, 13>  (Cycle of length 4)
- <2, 4, 7, 14>  (Cycle of length 4)
- <2, 3, 1, 10>  (Cycle of length 4)
- <2, 8, 6, 13>  (Cycle of length 4)
- <3, 7, 4, 14>  (Cycle of length 4)
- <3, 1, 2, 8>  (Cycle of length 4)
- <3, 6, 8, 5>  (Cycle of length 4)
- <4, 7, 12, 13>  (Cycle of length 4)
- <5, 8, 2, 4, 10> (Cycle of length 5)
- <6, 3, 1, 7, 4> (Cycle of length 5)
- <6, 3, 7, 12, 13> (Cycle of length 5)
- <8, 2, 4, 7, 12> (Cycle of length 5)
- <8, 5, 13, 12, 7> (Cycle of length 5)
- <10, 4, 7, 12, 13> (Cycle of length 5)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chord in <5, 8, 2, 4, 10>: (8, 2)
- Chord in <6, 3, 1, 7, 4>: (3, 7)
- Chord in <6, 3, 7, 12, 13>: (3, 12)
- Chord in <8, 2, 4, 7, 12>: (2, 7)
- Chord in <8, 5, 13, 12, 7>: (5, 12)
- Chord in <10, 4, 7, 12, 13>: (4, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are a total of 15 cycles listed above, and 5 of them have exactly one chord. So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
