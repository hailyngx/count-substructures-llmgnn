    - <1, 16, 9, 5>
    - <1, 11, 7, 5>
    - <1, 11, 15, 8>
    - <2, 13, 9, 5>
    - <2, 13, 18, 13>
    - <2, 17, 8, 15>
    - <2, 17, 19, 8>
    - <3, 5, 9, 16>
    - <3, 5, 7, 11>
    - <3, 4, 6, 12>
    - <4, 3, 5, 7>
    - <4, 3, 10, 8>
    - <4, 6, 12, 14>
    - <6, 4, 3, 5>
    - <6, 4, 10, 8>
    - <6, 12, 14, 0>

    - <8, 15, 17, 2>
    - <8, 19, 17, 2>
    - <8, 19, 11, 7>
    - <10, 8, 15, 14>
    - <10, 8, 17, 19>
    - <10, 4, 3, 5>
    - <10, 4, 6, 12>
    - <11, 15, 14, 12>
    - <11, 15, 8, 10>
    - <11, 15, 7, 5>
    - <11, 1, 16, 0>
    - <12, 14, 0, 16>
    - <12, 6, 4, 3>

    - <17, 2, 10, 6>
    - <18, 13, 9, 16>
    - <19, 8, 15, 11>
    - <19, 8, 17, 2>
    - <19, 11, 15, 14>

Step 2:
- After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, the chordal 4-cycles are:
    - <11, 15, 7, 5>, chord: (1, 16)
    - <2, 13, 18, 13>, chord: (2, 17)
    - <8, 15, 17, 2>, chord: (8, 19)
    - <4, 3, 5, 7>, chord: (4, 6)
    - <14, 0, 16, 1>, chord: (0, 14)

Step 3:
- The number of chordless cycles found is [56].
