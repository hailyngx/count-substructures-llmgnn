Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-4-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-3-4-8-0
- Cycle 3: 0-6-7-8-0
- Cycle 4: 1-2-6-0-1
- Cycle 5: 1-4-8-7-1
- Cycle 6: 1-6-7-8-1
- Cycle 7: 2-6-0-3-2
- Cycle 8: 3-4-8-7-3
- Cycle 9: 4-8-7-6-4
- Cycle 10: 5-6-1-9-5
- Cycle 11: 5-7-8-6-5
- Cycle 12: 5-7-0-6-5
- Cycle 13: 6-7-8-4-6
- Cycle 14: 7-8-4-3-7
- Cycle 15: 8-4-3-0-8
- Cycle 16: 9-1-2-6-9
- Cycle 17: 9-3-0-1-9

Step 2: 
Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 4, 7, 8, (1, 3)>
- <1, 6, 7, 8, (1, 4)>
- <3, 4, 8, 7, (3, 0)>

Step 3:
There are [3] chordless 4-cycles.
