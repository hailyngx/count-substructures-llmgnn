Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 4, 14> with chord (4, 14)
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 4, 16> with chord (4, 16)
- Cycle 3: <0, 12, 5, 9> with chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 4: <1, 3, 14, 17> with chord (3, 17)
- Cycle 5: <1, 10, 11, 17> with chord (10, 17)
- Cycle 6: <1, 13, 11, 17> with chord (11, 17)
- Cycle 7: <1, 19, 17, 14> with chord (17, 14)
- Cycle 8: <2, 13, 11, 17> with chord (13, 17)
- Cycle 9: <3, 14, 17, 19> with chord (14, 19)
- Cycle 10: <4, 7, 0, 12> with chord (0, 12)
- Cycle 11: <5, 8, 6, 15> with chord (6, 15)
- Cycle 12: <5, 9, 15, 6> with chord (9, 15)
- Cycle 13: <8, 17, 19, 11> with chord (17, 11)
- Cycle 14: <8, 17, 14, 2> with chord (17, 2)
- Cycle 15: <9, 5, 12, 4> with chord (5, 4)
- Cycle 16: <10, 11, 13, 1> with chord (11, 13)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- From the above list, Cycle 5: <1, 10, 11, 17> with chord (10, 17) qualifies as a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are no chordless cycles found.

Final Result:
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
