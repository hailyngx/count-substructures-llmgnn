Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 1) (10, 11) (10, 8) (10, 1) (10, 2) (11, 6) (11, 10) (11, 7) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 4) (7, 6) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (12, 11) (12, 3) (12, 1) (12, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (14, 9) (14, 8) (5, 11) (5, 0) (5, 13) (5, 4) (5, 3) (13, 5) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 7) (8, 12) (8, 14) (4, 11) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 12) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 10) (2, 7) (1, 9) (1, 10) (1, 12) (1, 0) (1, 4)

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the given graph, but not all of them contain all edges. We need to identify the cycles that contain all given edges. 
- One of the cycles that contains all given edges is <0, 1, 4, 5>.
- Another cycle is <1, 4, 11, 5>.
- Yet another cycle is <2, 9, 1, 10>.

Step 2:
- Next, we check each cycle for exactly one chord:
  - <0, 1, 4, 5> has a chord: (1, 5)
  - <1, 4, 11, 5> has a chord: (4, 11)
  - <2, 9, 1, 10> has a chord: (9, 10)

Step 3:
- We counted 0 chordless cycles as all identified cycles have chords.

Therefore, the final count is [0].
