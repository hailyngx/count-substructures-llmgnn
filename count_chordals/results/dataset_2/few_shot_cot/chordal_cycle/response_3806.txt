Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <3, 15, 29, 13>
        - Cycle 2: <3, 21, 18, 29>
        - Cycle 3: <3, 2, 15, 29>
        - Cycle 4: <3, 8, 1, 17>
        - Cycle 5: <5, 1, 17, 12>
        - Cycle 6: <5, 20, 4, 26>
        - Cycle 7: <5, 20, 4, 0>
        - Cycle 8: <5, 20, 9, 6>
        - Cycle 9: <8, 1, 17, 12>
        - Cycle 10: <8, 3, 15, 29>
        - Cycle 11: <11, 19, 14, 24>
        - Cycle 12: <11, 19, 16, 25>
        - Cycle 13: <11, 22, 18, 29>
        - Cycle 14: <14, 28, 6, 9>
        - Cycle 15: <14, 28, 6, 10>
        - Cycle 16: <14, 19, 11, 22>
        - Cycle 17: <16, 25, 0, 26>
        - Cycle 18: <16, 25, 13, 29>
        - Cycle 19: <16, 19, 11, 22>
        - Cycle 20: <19, 11, 22, 27>
        - Cycle 21: <20, 9, 6, 28>
        - Cycle 22: <24, 26, 0, 25>
        - Cycle 23: <24, 26, 4, 20>
        - Cycle 24: <27, 18, 22, 11>
        - Cycle 25: <27, 18, 21, 5>
        - Cycle 26: <27, 23, 25, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (15, 13) 
        - Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (18, 29)
        - Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (1, 17)
        - Cycle 5 has exactly one chord: (1, 17)
        - Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: (20, 26)
        - Cycle 7 has exactly one chord: (20, 4)
        - Cycle 8 has exactly one chord: (9, 6)
        - Cycle 9 has exactly one chord: (1, 17)
        - Cycle 10 has exactly one chord: (15, 29)
        - Cycle 11 has exactly one chord: (19, 14)
        - Cycle 12 has exactly one chord: (19, 16)
        - Cycle 13 has exactly one chord: (22, 18)
        - Cycle 14 has exactly one chord: (28, 9)
        - Cycle 15 has no chords.
        - Cycle 16 has exactly one chord: (19, 11)
        - Cycle 17 has exactly one chord: (25, 0)
        - Cycle 18 has exactly one chord: (25, 13)
        - Cycle 19 has exactly one chord: (22, 11)
        - Cycle 20 has exactly one chord: (11, 22)
        - Cycle 21 has exactly one chord: (6, 28)
        - Cycle 22 has exactly one chord: (24, 26)
        - Cycle 23 has exactly one chord: (20, 4)
        - Cycle 24 has exactly one chord: (11, 22)
        - Cycle 25 has exactly one chord: (18, 21)
        - Cycle 26 has exactly one chord: (25, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There are 3 chordless cycles: Cycle 15, Cycle 17, and Cycle 26

Therefore, the final count is [3].
