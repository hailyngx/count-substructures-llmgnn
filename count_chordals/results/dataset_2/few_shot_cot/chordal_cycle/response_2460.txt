Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 8, 14, 5, 1>
- <0, 8, 2, 11, 1>
- <0, 14, 7, 1, 9>
- <0, 1, 5, 13, 3>
- <8, 13, 5, 6, 3>
- <8, 13, 11, 2, 10>
- <8, 13, 11, 4, 9>
- <8, 13, 11, 4, 8>
- <8, 2, 11, 13, 5>
- <8, 2, 14, 7, 1>
- <8, 2, 14, 12, 6>
- <8, 2, 14, 0, 1>
- <8, 14, 7, 1, 9>
- <8, 14, 12, 6, 3>
- <8, 14, 12, 6, 9>
- <8, 14, 0, 1, 5>
- <8, 14, 0, 1, 7>
- <13, 11, 2, 10, 2>
- <13, 11, 4, 8, 13>
- <13, 11, 4, 9, 6>
- <13, 11, 4, 9, 1>
- <13, 11, 4, 8, 2>
- <13, 5, 14, 7, 1>
- <13, 5, 14, 12, 6>
- <13, 5, 14, 0, 1>
- <13, 5, 14, 0, 8>
- <4, 9, 3, 13, 5>
- <4, 9, 6, 3, 13>
- <5, 6, 9, 7, 14>
- <5, 6, 3, 9, 4>
- <5, 6, 3, 13, 11>
- <5, 6, 3, 13, 8>
- <6, 9, 4, 8, 13>
- <6, 9, 4, 11, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chord in <5, 6, 9, 7, 14>: (6, 9)
- Chord in <5, 6, 3, 9, 4>: (6, 9)
- Chord in <6, 9, 4, 8, 13>: (9, 8)
- Chord in <8, 13, 11, 2, 10>: (13, 11)
- Chord in <8, 2, 14, 12, 6>: (14, 6)
- Chord in <4, 9, 3, 13, 5>: (9, 13)
- Chord in <5, 6, 3, 13, 11>: (6, 13)
- Chord in <6, 3, 13, 8, 2>: (13, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [28]
