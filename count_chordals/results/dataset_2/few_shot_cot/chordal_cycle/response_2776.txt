Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- In the cycle <0, 5, 9, 1, 4>, the chord is (5, 1).
- In the cycle <0, 5, 9, 13, 10>, no chord present.
- In the cycle <0, 5, 9, 13, 1>, no chord present.
- In the cycle <0, 7, 4, 1, 9>, no chord present.
- In the cycle <0, 7, 10, 3, 14>, no chord present.
- In the cycle <0, 7, 11, 12, 14>, no chord present.
- In the cycle <0, 14, 4, 1, 9>, no chord present.
- In the cycle <0, 14, 10, 3, 13>, no chord present.
- In the cycle <1, 9, 5, 6, 13>, no chord present.
- In the cycle <1, 9, 13, 3, 10>, no chord present.
- In the cycle <2, 5, 9, 13, 8>, no chord present.
