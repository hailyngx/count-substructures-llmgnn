Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. (4, 8, 5, 7)
2. (4, 5, 6, 2)
3. (4, 5, 8, 7)
4. (4, 8, 9, 3)
5. (0, 8, 9, 3)
6. (0, 4, 5, 8)
7. (1, 7, 6, 3)
8. (1, 6, 5, 7)
9. (2, 4, 8, 5)
10. (2, 4, 5, 6)
11. (2, 6, 7, 1)
12. (2, 8, 9, 3)
13. (3, 1, 7, 6)
14. (3, 6, 5, 4)
15. (3, 9, 8, 4)
16. (5, 6, 7, 8)
17. (6, 7, 5, 4)
18. (6, 5, 4, 8)
19. (6, 1, 7, 8)
20. (8, 4, 5, 6)
21. (8, 5, 4, 0)
22. (8, 7, 6, 1)
23. (8, 9, 3, 1)
24. (9, 3, 6, 1)
25. (9, 8, 4, 0)

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (3, 9), 6)>
<4, (8, 5), 7)>
<4, (5, 2), 8)>
<4, (5, 8), 7)>
<4, (8, 9), 3)>
<0, (8, 9), 3)>
<0, (4, 5), 8)>
<1, (6, 7), 3)>
<2, (4, 5), 6)>
<2, (5, 6), 4)>
<2, (6, 7), 1)>
<2, (8, 9), 3)>
<3, (1, 7), 6)>
<3, (6, 5), 4)>
<3, (8, 9), 4)>
<5, (6, 7), 8)>
<6, (5, 7), 4)>
<6, (7, 8), 5)>
<8, (4, 5), 6)>
<8, (5, 4), 0)>
<8, (7, 6), 1)>
<8, (9, 3), 1)>
<9, (3, 6), 1)>
<9, (8, 4), 0)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [1].
