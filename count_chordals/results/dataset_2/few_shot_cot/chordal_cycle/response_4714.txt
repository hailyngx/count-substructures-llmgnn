Response:
After following the steps to find chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, we have:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 7, 0, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 7, 2, 4, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 7, 2, 3, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 4, 2, 7, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 4, 1, 6, 5>
- Cycle 6: <5, 1, 6, 0, 5>
- Cycle 7: <5, 1, 4, 2, 5>
- Cycle 8: <5, 3, 2, 4, 5>
- Cycle 9: <9, 7, 0, 6, 9>
- Cycle 10: <9, 7, 2, 4, 9>
- Cycle 11: <9, 7, 2, 3, 9>
- Cycle 12: <9, 4, 2, 7, 9>
- Cycle 13: <9, 4, 1, 6, 9>
- Cycle 14: <9, 1, 6, 0, 9>
- Cycle 15: <9, 1, 4, 2, 9>
- Cycle 16: <9, 0, 6, 1, 9>
- Cycle 17: <9, 0, 7, 2, 9>
- Cycle 18: <6, 1, 4, 2, 6>
- Cycle 19: <6, 0, 7, 2, 6>
- Cycle 20: <4, 1, 6, 9, 4>
- Cycle 21: <4, 1, 6, 0, 4>
- Cycle 22: <4, 3, 7, 2, 4>
- Cycle 23: <1, 6, 0, 9, 1>
- Cycle 24: <1, 4, 2, 7, 1>
- Cycle 25: <3, 7, 2, 4, 3>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chord found
- Cycle 2: Chord found
- Cycle 3: Chord found
- Cycle 4: Chord found
- Cycle 5: Chord found
- Cycle 6: Chord found
- Cycle 7: Chord found
- Cycle 8: Chord found
- Cycle 9: Chord found
- Cycle 10: Chord found
- Cycle 11: Chord found
- Cycle 12: Chord found
- Cycle 13: Chord found
- Cycle 14: Chord found
- Cycle 15: Chord found
- Cycle 16: Chord found
- Cycle 17: Chord found
- Cycle 18: Chord found
- Cycle 19: Chord found
- Cycle 20: Chord found
- Cycle 21: Chord found
- Cycle 22: Chord found
- Cycle 23: Chord found
- Cycle 24: Chord found
- Cycle 25: Chord found

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
Since all cycles have chords, there are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordless 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
