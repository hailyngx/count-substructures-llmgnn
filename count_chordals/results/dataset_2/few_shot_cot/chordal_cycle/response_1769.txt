Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are: 
<0, 9, 5, 8>
<0, 9, 5, 7>
<0, 9, 2, 1>
<0, 8, 5, 7>
<0, 8, 5, 9>
<0, 8, 4, 6>
<0, 8, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 4, 7>
<0, 6, 7, 5>
<0, 6, 7, 4>
<1, 9, 5, 8>
<1, 9, 5, 7>
<1, 9, 2, 3>
<1, 7, 5, 8>
<1, 7, 5, 9>
<1, 7, 4, 6>
<1, 7, 4, 8>
<1, 3, 7, 4>
<1, 3, 7, 5>
<2, 9, 5, 8>
<2, 9, 5, 7>
<2, 9, 1, 4>
<2, 6, 4, 7>
<2, 6, 4, 8>
<2, 6, 7, 5>
<2, 8, 5, 7>
<2, 8, 5, 9>
<2, 8, 0, 6>
<3, 7, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 4, 6>
<3, 1, 4, 8>
<3, 1, 4, 6>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
<0, 9, 5, 8, (0, 5)>
<0, 9, 2, 1, (9, 1)>
<0, 8, 4, 7, (8, 4)>
<0, 6, 4, 7, (6, 7)>
<1, 9, 5, 8, (9, 8)>
<1, 7, 4, 6, (7, 4)>
<2, 9, 1, 4, (9, 4)>
<2, 6, 7, 5, (6, 5)>
<3, 7, 4, 8, (7, 8)>
<3, 1, 4, 8, (1, 8)>

Step 3:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [10].
