Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (8, 13) (8, 4) (13, 8) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 0) (13, 6) (10, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 4) (11, 3) (11, 7) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 10) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 12) (9, 13) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 12) (12, 10) (12, 2) (12, 3) (12, 9) (12, 5) (12, 0) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 6) (14, 1) (14, 7) (7, 11) (7, 14) (7, 5) (7, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 12) (5, 7) (0, 13) (0, 12) (0, 1) (6, 13) (6, 10) (6, 2) (6, 14) (1, 10) (1, 9) (1, 14) (1, 7) (1, 0)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (2, 12, 10, 4)
- (2, 12, 5, 3)
- (2, 6, 14, 3)
- (2, 14, 7, 1)
- (3, 12, 10, 4)
- (3, 14, 7, 1)
- (4, 10, 6, 13)
- (4, 10, 12, 3)
- (5, 12, 10, 1)
- (5, 12, 3, 14)
- (6, 10, 12, 3)
- (6, 10, 4, 13)
- (7, 1, 10, 4)
- (7, 1, 0, 13)
- (9, 13, 8, 4)
- (9, 13, 6, 14)
- (9, 12, 10, 4)
- (9, 12, 3, 14)
- (11, 3, 12, 10)
- (11, 3, 14, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <2, 12, 10, 4>
- <2, 12, 5, 3>
- <2, 6, 14, 3>
- <2, 14, 7, 1>
- <4, 10, 6, 13>
- <4, 10, 12, 3>
- <5, 12, 10, 1>
- <5, 12, 3, 14>
- <6, 10, 12, 3>
- <6, 10, 4, 13>
- <7, 1, 10, 4>
- <7, 1, 0, 13>
- <9, 13, 8, 4>
- <9, 13, 6, 14>
- <9, 12, 10, 4>
- <9, 12, 3, 14>
- <11, 3, 12, 10>
- <11, 3, 14, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 18 chordal 4-cycles in total. So, the final answer is [18].
