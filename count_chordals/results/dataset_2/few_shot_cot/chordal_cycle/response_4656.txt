Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle: <0, 8, 12, 3, 1>
- Cycle: <0, 8, 12, 6, 3>
- Cycle: <1, 3, 6, 4, 5>
- Cycle: <1, 11, 14, 10, 5>
- Cycle: <4, 5, 10, 9, 8>
- Cycle: <4, 6, 12, 2, 14>
- Cycle: <4, 7, 13, 9, 10>
- Cycle: <5, 10, 14, 2, 13>
- Cycle: <6, 3, 12, 2, 13>
- Cycle: <6, 4, 7, 13, 2>
- Cycle: <8, 0, 11, 14, 10>
  
Step 2:
For the cycles listed above, the only cycle with exactly one chord is <1, 3, 6, 4, 5>. So, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 3, 6, 4, 5>.
  
Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles found = [10]
