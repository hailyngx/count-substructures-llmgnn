Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 4: <0, 8, 11, 9> - Chord: (8, 9)
- Cycle 12: <2, 18, 14, 6> - Chord: (18, 6)
- Cycle 29: <6, 17, 19, 12> - Chord: (17, 12)
- Cycle 31: <7, 13, 4, 12> - Chord: (13, 4)
- Cycle 34: <8, 11, 12, 4> - Chord: (11, 4)
- Cycle 37: <9, 5, 18, 10> - Chord: (5, 18)
- Cycle 41: <11, 9, 4, 12> - Chord: (9, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
