Step 2: Identify chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 16, (21, 26), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 1, (27, 3), 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 29, (3, 27), 17>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 5, (22, 23), 28>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 5, (11, 15), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 14, (1, 6), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 14, (25, 8), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <7, 1, (27, 3), 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 13, (28, 23), 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <10, 3, (27, 17), 26>
