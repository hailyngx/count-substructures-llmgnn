Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 1, 15, 22>, Chord: (1, 15)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 0, 11, 1>, Chord: (0, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 15, 22, 4>, Chord: (4, 15)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 22, 10, 23>, Chord: (10, 23)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 15, 22, 10>, Chord: (22, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 24, 9, 18>, Chord: (9, 24)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 25, 12, 7>, Chord: (12, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <7, 12, 25, 6>, Chord: (25, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <8, 2, 17, 7>, Chord: (17, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <8, 22, 15, 4>, Chord: (15, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <18, 9, 24, 27>, Chord: (24, 27)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <20, 21, 16, 1>, Chord: (16, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <26, 18, 20, 21>, Chord: (18, 21)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
