Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-10-3-0-15-11-14-5 (length 7)
- Cycle 2: 1-10-3-15-0-8-4-17-5 (length 9)
- Cycle 3: 1-10-8-4-17-5-14-11-2-9 (length 9)
- Cycle 4: 7-19-0-15-3-10-1-18-12-16-8 (length 10)
- Cycle 5: 7-19-0-8-4-17-5-14-11-2-9 (length 10)
- Cycle 6: 7-19-0-15-3-10-1-18-13-7 (length 10)
- Cycle 7: 7-19-2-9-11-14-5-17-4-8-16 (length 10)
- Cycle 8: 7-19-2-11-14-5-17-4-8-16-12 (length 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (3, 15)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (8, 16)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (1, 18)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (8, 16)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (0, 8)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (9, 14)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (5, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <1, 18, 10, 3>
2. <4, (3, 15), 17, 5>
3. <4, (8, 16), 8, 17>
4. <7, (0, 8), 19, 15>
5. <9, (9, 14), 11, 2>
