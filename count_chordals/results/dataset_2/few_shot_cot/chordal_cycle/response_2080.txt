Node 5 is connected to node 4, 13, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 11
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 2, and node 9

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 2, 8> with chords (0, 2)
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 11, 4> with chords (0, 11)
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 13, 11> with chords (5, 13)
- Cycle 4: <2, 3, 11, 6> with chords (2, 11)
- Cycle 5: <2, 8, 13, 1> with chords (2, 13)
- Cycle 6: <4, 12, 9, 1> with chords (4, 9)
- Cycle 7: <9, 8, 13, 1> with chords (9, 13)
- Cycle 8: <10, 4, 11, 3> with chords (10, 11)

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, only the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 13, 11> with chord (5, 13)

Step 3:
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
