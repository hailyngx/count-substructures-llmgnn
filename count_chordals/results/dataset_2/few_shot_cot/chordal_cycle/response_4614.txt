Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 1, 3, 0, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 1, 2, 8, 5>
- Cycle 4: <9, 8, 1, 3, 9>
- Cycle 5: <4, 7, 0, 3, 4>
- Cycle 6: <5, 6, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 7: <0, 9, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 8: <3, 4, 6, 5, 3>
- Cycle 9: <2, 1, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle 10: <8, 1, 3, 0, 8>
- Cycle 11: <9, 8, 2, 5, 9>
- Cycle 12: <6, 5, 2, 0, 6>

Step 2: 
Out of the above cycles, the only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 1: <5, 1, 7, 4, 5>. Thus, we have found 1 chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: 
Therefore, the number of chordless chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
