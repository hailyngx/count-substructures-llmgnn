Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 8) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 4, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 9, 1, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 9, 1, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 1, 5, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 6, 4, 5, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 6, 4, 7, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 9, 0, 7, 3, 5, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 7, 0, 8, 2>
- Cycle 9: <3, 1, 9, 6, 4, 7, 3>

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for a chord:
    - Cycle 1: Chord found, <0, 6, 4, 5, 0>
    - Cycle 2: Chord found, <0, 6, 9, 1, 0>
    - Cycle 3: Chord found, <0, 6, 9, 1, 5, 0>
    - Cycle 4: Chord found, <0, 9, 1, 5, 0>
    - Cycle 5: Chord found, <1, 9, 6, 4, 5, 1>
    - Cycle 6: No chord found, <1, 9, 6, 4, 7, 1>
    - Cycle 7: No chord found, <1, 9, 0, 7, 3, 5, 1>
    - Cycle 8: Chord found, <2, 4, 7, 0, 8, 2>
    - Cycle 9: No chord found, <3, 1, 9, 6, 4, 7, 3>

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles = [4]
