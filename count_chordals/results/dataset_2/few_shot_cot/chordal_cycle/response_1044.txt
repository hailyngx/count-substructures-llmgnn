Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, 15, 18, 11, 16, 17, 3> has chord (15, 16)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, 15, 8, 16, 17, 14, 7, 3> has chord (15, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, 13, 14, 17, 1, 19, 13> has chord (14, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 15, 3, 6, 5, 14, 17, 1, 5, 4> has chord (15, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <16, 17, 14, 7, 10, 2, 3, 13, 19, 1, 17> has chord (14, 3)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <18, 11, 16, 17, 14, 13, 19, 0> has chord (11, 19)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <15, 8, 16, 17, 14, 13, 19, 1, 17> has chord (8, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <15, 8, 16, 11, 18, 0, 19, 13, 3> has chord (8, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]
