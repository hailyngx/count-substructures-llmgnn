Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle <0, 7, 4, 5, 0>
- Cycle <0, 7, 2, 1, 0>
- Cycle <0, 7, 3, 6, 0>
- Cycle <1, 6, 3, 2, 1>
- Cycle <1, 6, 0, 5, 1>
- Cycle <1, 4, 7, 2, 1>
- Cycle <2, 7, 4, 5, 2>
- Cycle <2, 7, 0, 6, 2>
- Cycle <2, 7, 3, 6, 2>
- Cycle <3, 7, 4, 1, 3>
- Cycle <5, 4, 7, 2, 5>
- Cycle <5, 4, 1, 6, 5>
- Cycle <6, 0, 7, 2, 6>
- Cycle <9, 8, 5, 0, 9>
- Cycle <9, 8, 1, 4, 9>

Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 6, 3, 2, 1> with chord (2, 3)

Step 3:
There is 1 chordless 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
