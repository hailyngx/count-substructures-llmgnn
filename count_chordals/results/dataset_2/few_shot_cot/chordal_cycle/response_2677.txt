Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle: <0, 14, 13, 5> with chord (3, 9)
- Cycle: <0, 14, 13, 5> with chord (6, 10)
- Cycle: <0, 14, 13, 5> with chord (12, 16)
- Cycle: <0, 14, 13, 5> with chord (8, 19)
- Cycle: <4, 18, 12, 16> with chord (7, 11)
- Cycle: <4, 18, 12, 16> with chord (3, 9)
- Cycle: <3, 18, 12, 16> with chord (7, 11)
- Cycle: <3, 18, 12, 16> with chord (2, 18)
- Cycle: <4, 18, 3, 2> with chord (14, 0)
- Cycle: <4, 18, 3, 2> with chord (8, 19)
- Cycle: <4, 19, 16, 17> with chord (0, 14)
- Cycle: <4, 19, 16, 17> with chord (6, 8)
- Cycle: <4, 19, 16, 17> with chord (3, 9)
- Cycle: <4, 17, 16, 19> with chord (0, 14)
- Cycle: <4, 17, 16, 19> with chord (12, 18)
- Cycle: <3, 18, 4, 19> with chord (0, 14)
- Cycle: <3, 18, 4, 19> with chord (6, 10)
- Cycle: <3, 18, 4, 19> with chord (12, 16)
- Cycle: <5, 12, 16, 17> with chord (3, 9)
- Cycle: <5, 12, 16, 17> with chord (0, 14)
- Cycle: <5, 12, 16, 17> with chord (8, 19)
- Cycle: <0, 14, 13, 5> with chord (4, 18)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 14, 13, 5> with chord (6, 10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]
