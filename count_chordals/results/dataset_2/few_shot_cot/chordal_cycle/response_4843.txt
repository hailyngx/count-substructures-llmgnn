Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
There are three cycles of length 4 in the graph: 
1. Cycle 1: <5, 6, 1, 3, 5>
2. Cycle 2: <5, 3, 8, 5>
3. Cycle 3: <5, 4, 0, 6, 5>

Step 2: 
Checking for chords in each cycle: 
1. Cycle 1 has two chords: (6, 1) and (3, 5)
2. Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (3, 8)
3. Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (4, 0)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found. 

Therefore, the final count is [2].
