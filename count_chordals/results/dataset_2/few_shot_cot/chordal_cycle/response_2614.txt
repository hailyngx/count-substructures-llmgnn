Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
First, let's find all cycles of length 4 in the graph:

1. (5, 9, 4, 6, 5)
2. (5, 9, 4, 2, 5)
3. (<5, 9, 1, 6, 5>)
4. (<5, 9, 1, 2, 5>)
5. (9, 4, 6, 5, 9)
6. (9, 4, 2, 5, 9)
7. (<9, 4, 3, 7, 9>)
8. (<9, 4, 7, 8, 9>)
9. (4, 6, 5, 9, 4)
10. (4, 2, 5, 9, 4)
11. (<4, 3, 7, 8, 4>)
12. (7, 3, 4, 9, 7)
13. (7, 8, 9, 4, 7)
14. (1, 2, 4, 9, 1)
15. (1, 6, 5, 9, 1)
16. (2, 4, 9, 1, 2)
17. (2, 6, 5, 9, 2)
18. (3, 4, 9, 7, 3)
19. (3, 7, 9, 8, 3)
20. (6, 5, 9, 1, 6)
21. (6, 4, 9, 2, 6)

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. (5, 9, 4, 6, 5) - Chord {9, 4}
2. (5, 9, 4, 2, 5) - Chord {9, 4}
3. <5, 9, 1, 6, 5> - No chord
4. <5, 9, 1, 2, 5> - No chord
5. (9, 4, 6, 5, 9) - Chord {9, 4}
6. (9, 4, 2, 5, 9) - Chord {9, 4}
7. <9, 4, 3, 7, 9> - No chord
8. <9, 4, 7, 8, 9> - No chord
9. (4, 6, 5, 9, 4) - Chord {4, 9}
10. (4, 2, 5, 9, 4) - Chord {4, 9}
11. <4, 3, 7, 8, 4> - No chord
12. (7, 3, 4, 9, 7) - Chord {7, 4}
13. (7, 8, 9, 4, 7) - Chord {7, 4}
14. (1, 2, 4, 9, 1) - Chord {1, 4}
15. (1, 6, 5, 9, 1) - Chord {1, 5}
16. (2, 4, 9, 1, 2) - Chord {2, 9}
17. (2, 6, 5, 9, 2) - Chord {2, 5}
18. (3, 4, 9, 7, 3) - Chord {3, 9}
19. (3, 7, 9, 8, 3) - Chord {3, 9}
20. (6, 5, 9, 1, 6) - Chord {6, 9}
21. (6, 4, 9, 2, 6) - Chord {6, 9}

Finally, counting the number of chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord gives us a total of [14].
