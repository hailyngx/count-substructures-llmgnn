Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle: <0, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 1, 3, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 1, 6, 2, 9, 3, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 4, 7, 3, 0>
- Cycle: <0, 9, 3, 7, 4, 8, 1, 5, 0>
- Cycle: <1, 5, 4, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 5, 0, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 5, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle: <2, 9, 3, 7, 4, 8, 1, 6, 2>
- Cycle: <2, 9, 3, 1, 5, 6, 2>
- Cycle: <2, 7, 4, 8, 1, 6, 2>
- Cycle: <2, 7, 4, 5, 1, 6, 2>
- Cycle: <3, 9, 0, 5, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 9, 0, 5, 1, 6, 2, 7, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 9, 0, 5, 1, 8, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle: <4, 5, 1, 8, 4>
- Cycle: <4, 7, 3, 9, 0, 5, 4>
- Cycle: <5, 6, 2, 9, 3, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle: <6, 5, 0, 9, 2, 6>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, 1, 6, 2, 9, 3, 0>

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
