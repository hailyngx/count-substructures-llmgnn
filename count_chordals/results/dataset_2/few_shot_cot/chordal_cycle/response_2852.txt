Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 15) (16, 11) (16, 1) (16, 8) (16, 6) (14, 17) (14, 6) (14, 5) (14, 10) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 8) (17, 2) (17, 18) (6, 11) (6, 16) (6, 14) (6, 9) (6, 15) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 19) (1, 16) (1, 3) (1, 10) (1, 12) (3, 11) (3, 1) (3, 4) (4, 3) (7, 19) (13, 17) (8, 16) (8, 17) (8, 15) (19, 9) (19, 7) (19, 0) (0, 19) (10, 14) (10, 1) (10, 12) (2, 17) (2, 9) (15, 11) (15, 6) (15, 8) (15, 18) (5, 14) (5, 18) (12, 1) (12, 10) (12, 18) (18, 17) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 12)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle with 4 nodes: (11, 16, 1, 3, 11)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (6, 11, 15, 18, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <11, 16, 1, 3>: Chord (1, 3)
- <6, 11, 15, 18>: Chord (15, 18)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

Since we found 2 chordal 4-cycles, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
