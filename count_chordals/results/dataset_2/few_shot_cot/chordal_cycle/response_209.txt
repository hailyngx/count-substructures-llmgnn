Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 14, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 14, 17, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 16, 13, 3>
- Cycle 4: <2, 16, 5, 18>
- Cycle 5: <3, 13, 10, 4>
- Cycle 6: <4, 12, 17, 1>
- Cycle 7: <4, 12, 19, 2>
- Cycle 8: <5, 10, 6, 18>
- Cycle 9: <6, 2, 16, 5>
- Cycle 10: <11, 12, 17, 14>
- Cycle 11: <11, 12, 19, 2>
- Cycle 12: <11, 14, 17, 1>
- Cycle 13: <13, 3, 4, 10>
- Cycle 14: <14, 0, 11, 12>
- Cycle 15: <14, 0, 11, 16>
- Cycle 16: <16, 2, 8, 18>
- Cycle 17: <16, 2, 19, 12>
- Cycle 18: <16, 13, 3, 4>
- Cycle 19: <17, 1, 14, 7>
- Cycle 20: <17, 12, 11, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <2, 16, 13, 3> has one chord: (2, 3)
- <2, 16, 5, 18> has one chord: (16, 5)
- <3, 13, 10, 4> has one chord: (13, 10)
- <4, 12, 19, 2> has one chord: (4, 19)
- <5, 10, 6, 18> has one chord: (10, 6)
- <6, 2, 16, 5> has one chord: (2, 5)
- <11, 12, 17, 14> has one chord: (12, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 20 cycles of length 4 or more listed. Only 14 of them contain exactly one chord. So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [14].
