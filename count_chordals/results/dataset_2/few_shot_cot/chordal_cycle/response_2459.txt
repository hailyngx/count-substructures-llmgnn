Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 6>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 5, 3>
- Cycle 3: <2, 3, 5, 8>
- Cycle 4: <4, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle 5: <5, 4, 9, 8>
- Cycle 6: <6, 1, 9, 2>
- Cycle 7: <8, 3, 4, 9>
- Cycle 8: <9, 4, 5, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 6> --> Chord: (4, 1)
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 5, 3> --> Chord: (4, 5)
- Cycle 3: <2, 3, 5, 8> --> Chord: (3, 5)
- Cycle 4: <4, 9, 6, 1> --> Chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 5: <5, 4, 9, 8> --> Chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 6: <6, 1, 9, 2> --> Chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 7: <8, 3, 4, 9> --> Chord: (3, 4)
- Cycle 8: <9, 4, 5, 1> --> Chord: (4, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
