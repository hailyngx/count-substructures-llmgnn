Node 3 is connected to node 4, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, and node 1

Response:
Starting from Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- <4, 7, 6, 1, (4, 1), (7, 6)> 
- <4, 7, 9, 1, (4, 1), (7, 9)> 
- <4, 8, 1, 5, (4, 5), (8, 1)> 
- <4, 8, 3, 9, (4, 3), (8, 9)> 
- <7, 6, 1, 9, (7, 1), (6, 9)> 
- <7, 6, 5, 4, (7, 5), (6, 4)> 
- <7, 9, 1, 8, (7, 1), (9, 8)> 
- <6, 5, 2, 6, (6, 2), (5, 6)> 
- <6, 1, 9, 7, (6, 7), (1, 9)> 
- <9, 1, 8, 4, (9, 8), (1, 4)> 
- <5, 1, 9, 3, (5, 1), (1, 9)> 
- <5, 4, 7, 6, (5, 4), (4, 7)> 
- <1, 5, 4, 8, (1, 4), (5, 8)> 
- <1, 8, 3, 9, (1, 3), (8, 9)> 
- <3, 9, 7, 6, (3, 7), (9, 6)> 
- <3, 8, 4, 7, (3, 4), (8, 7)> 
- <2, 5, 1, 9, (2, 1), (5, 9)> 
- <0, 6, 7, 4, (0, 7), (6, 4)> 
- <0, 8, 4, 3, (0, 4), (8, 3)> 

Moving on to Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph are: 
- <4, 7, 9, 1, (4, 1), (7, 9)> 
- <4, 8, 1, 5, (4, 5), (8, 1)> 
- <4, 8, 3, 9, (4, 3), (8, 9)> 
- <7, 6, 1, 9, (7, 1), (6, 9)> 
- <7, 6, 5, 4, (7, 5), (6, 4)> 
- <9, 1, 8, 4, (9, 8), (1, 4)> 
- <5, 1, 9, 3, (5, 1), (1, 9)> 
- <1, 5, 4, 8, (1, 4), (5, 8)> 
- <1, 8, 3, 9, (1, 3), (8, 9)> 

Finally, in Step 3: 
There are a total of [9] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
