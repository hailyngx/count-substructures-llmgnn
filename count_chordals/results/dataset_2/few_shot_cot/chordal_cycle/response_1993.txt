Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 4, 28, 2, 0>
2. <0, 18, 28, 4, 0>
3. <1, 11, 5, 5, 1>
4. <1, 5, 21, 9, 1>
5. <1, 9, 24, 13, 8, 5, 1>

7. <2, 23, 4, 0, 18, 28, 2>
8. <4, 0, 18, 14, 23, 4>

15. <14, 18, 0, 4, 23, 2, 28, 18, 14>
16. <15, 7, 22, 26, 5, 21, 14, 23, 4, 0, 18, 28, 2, 20, 29, 15>

18. <18, 0, 4, 23, 14>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 18, 28, 4, 0> (Chord: (18, 4))
2. <1, 9, 24, 13, 8, 5, 1> (Chord: (24, 8))
3. <2, 20, 13, 8, 5, 26, 7, 22, 26, 27, 16, 15, 29, 20, 2> (Chord: (13, 26))
4. <7, 22, 26, 5, 21, 14, 18, 0, 4, 23, 2, 28, 18, 14, 23, 7> (Chord: (26, 18))
5. <13, 8, 5, 26, 27, 29, 15, 7, 22, 26, 7, 12, 19, 3, 6, 10, 17, 5, 13> (Chord: (5, 26))
6. <16, 27, 29, 15, 7, 22, 26, 5, 1, 11, 5, 8, 13, 24, 9, 21, 14, 18, 0, 4, 23, 2, 20, 13, 24, 9, 19, 3, 6, 10, 17, 5, 26, 16> (Chord: (27, 7))

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
