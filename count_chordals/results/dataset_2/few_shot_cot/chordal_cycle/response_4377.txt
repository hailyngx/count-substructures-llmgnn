Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 14) (3, 16) (15, 3) (15, 9) (15, 17) (4, 1) (4, 6) (18, 11) (18, 0) (1, 4) (1, 17) (1, 11) (1, 16) (17, 15) (17, 1) (17, 11) (5, 19) (5, 2) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 2) (19, 12) (12, 19) (12, 16) (12, 6) (16, 3) (16, 1) (16, 12) (2, 5) (2, 19) (2, 13) (2, 10) (2, 14) (11, 18) (11, 1) (11, 17) (11, 8) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 8) (8, 11) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 15) (6, 4) (6, 12) (6, 0) (10, 5) (10, 2) (10, 7) (13, 2) (13, 0) (7, 8) (7, 10) (0, 18) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 13)

Node 13 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 8
Node 15 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 17
Node 16 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 12
Node 17 is connected to node 15, 1, and node 11
Node 18 is connected to node 11, and node 0
Node 19 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 12

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <2, 19, 12, 6>. 

<2, 19, 12, 6> can be visualized as a rectangle with vertices 2, 19, 12, and 6. The chord in this 4-cycle is the edge connecting nodes 19 and 6.

Therefore, the final count of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
