Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 25, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 15, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 7, 13, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 29, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 13, 22, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 13, 7, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 15, 18, 3>
- Cycle 8: <4, 12, 8, 4>
- Cycle 9: <4, 12, 19, 4>
- Cycle 10: <4, 21, 26, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 21, 26, 22, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 21, 26, 23, 4>
- Cycle 13: <4, 21, 26, 29, 4>
- Cycle 14: <4, 21, 26, 22, 13, 4>
- Cycle 15: <4, 21, 26, 29, 5, 0, 18, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <7, 13, 22, 26, 21, 4, 12, 8, 3, 1, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordless cycles: [21]
