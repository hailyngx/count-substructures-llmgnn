Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<5, 24, 17, 10>  
<5, 24, 11, 4>  
<5, 16, 21, 13>  
<6, 9, 13, 8>  
<6, 9, 13, 21>  
<10, 17, 24, 11>  
<10, 17, 5, 16>  
<10, 3, 27, 29>  
<13, 9, 12, 16>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

<5, 24, 17, 10> has a chord: (5, 17)  
<5, 24, 11, 4> has a chord: (11, 4)  
<5, 16, 21, 13> has a chord: (21, 13)  
<6, 9, 13, 8> has a chord: (13, 8)  
<6, 9, 13, 21> has a chord: (13, 21)  
<10, 3, 27, 29> has a chord: (3, 27)  
<13, 9, 12, 16> has no chords  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There is one chordless cycle found, so the final count is [1].
