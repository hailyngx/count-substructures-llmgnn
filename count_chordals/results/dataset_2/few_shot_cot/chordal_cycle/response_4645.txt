- Cycle 2 has a chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (1, 17)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (13, 15)
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (13, 15)
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (13, 8)

- Cycle 29 has a chord: (13, 9)
- Cycle 30 has a chord: (15, 12)
- Cycle 31 has a chord: (1, 17)
- Cycle 32 has a chord: (1, 17)
- Cycle 37 has a chord: (15, 14)
- Cycle 42 has a chord: (2, 15)
- Cycle 44 has a chord: (1, 17)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:  
There are 44 cycles without a chord.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [44].
