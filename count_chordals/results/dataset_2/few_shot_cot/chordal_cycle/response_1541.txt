Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <5, 9, 14, 8> has a chord (14, 8)
- <5, 9, 16, 4> has a chord (16, 4)
- <5, 9, 16, 10> has a chord (16, 10)
- <5, 9, 13, 3> has a chord (9, 13)
- <5, 9, 13, 0> has a chord (9, 13)
- <5, 9, 14, 17> has a chord (14, 17)
- <5, 9, 14, 11> has a chord (14, 11)
- <5, 6, 15, 10> has a chord (6, 15)
- <9, 14, 17, 15> has a chord (14, 17)
- <9, 14, 17, 18> has a chord (14, 17)
- <9, 14, 11, 0> has a chord (14, 11)
- <9, 16, 10, 15> has a chord (10, 15)
- <14, 17, 15, 6> has a chord (14, 17)
- <14, 17, 18, 4> has a chord (17, 18)
- <14, 8, 2, 19> has a chord (8, 2)
- <16, 9, 14, 8> has a chord (9, 14)
- <16, 9, 13, 3> has a chord (9, 13)
- <16, 10, 15, 6> has a chord (15, 10)
- <17, 15, 6, 5> has a chord (15, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have found 18 chordal 4-cycles.
Therefore, the final count is [18].
