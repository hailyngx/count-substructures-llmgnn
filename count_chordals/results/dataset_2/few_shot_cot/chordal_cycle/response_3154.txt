Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 6, 5, 4, 9, 8, 3, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 5, 1, 7, 4, 9, 8, 3, 0)
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 4, 9, 8, 3, 0, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 5, 4, 7, 0, 3, 8, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 5, 4, 9, 3, 0, 7, 1)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 6 chordless cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 5, 4, 7>
