Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 1, 9, 10>
- Cycle <1, 9, 10, 11>
- Cycle <2, 4, 6, 13>
- Cycle <3, 5, 10, 11>
- Cycle <4, 6, 10, 11>
- Cycle <5, 7, 10, 11>
- Cycle <5, 10, 13, 14>
- Cycle <8, 0, 11, 4>
- Cycle <8, 1, 9, 10>
- Cycle <13, 0, 11, 4>
  
Step 2:
Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- The cycle <0, 1, 9, 10> has a chord (1, 9)
- The cycle <1, 9, 10, 11> has a chord (1, 9)
- The cycle <2, 4, 6, 13> has a chord (2, 6)
- The cycle <3, 5, 10, 11> has a chord (5, 10)
- The cycle <4, 6, 10, 11> has a chord (4, 11)
- The cycle <5, 7, 10, 11> has a chord (5, 11)
- The cycle <5, 10, 13, 14> has a chord (5, 14)
- The cycle <8, 0, 11, 4> has a chord (0, 11)
- The cycle <8, 1, 9, 10> has a chord (1, 9)
- The cycle <13, 0, 11, 4> has a chord (0, 11)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
