Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 9, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 2, 1, 4, 3, 9, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 6, 7, 1, 8, 0)
  
Step 2: Check for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
Since all cycles found are chordless, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
