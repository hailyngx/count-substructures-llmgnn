Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
<0, 12, 18, 19>
<0, 12, 5, 18>
<0, 15, 19, 18>
<1, 17, 6, 10>
<1, 17, 13, 12>
<1, 17, 6, 2>
<1, 8, 14, 2>
<1, 8, 3, 9>
<1, 8, 18, 19>
<2, 6, 10, 11>
<2, 6, 17, 13>
<2, 6, 7, 11>
<2, 7, 11, 5>
<2, 7, 19, 15>
<2, 7, 19, 18>
<2, 7, 14, 8>
<3, 8, 14, 19>
<3, 8, 18, 12>
<3, 9, 4, 16>
<4, 9, 16, 13>
<5, 11, 7, 19>
<5, 11, 10, 6>
<5, 18, 12, 13>
<6, 10, 11, 7>
<6, 17, 13, 16>
<7, 11, 5, 12>
<8, 14, 19, 15>
<9, 16, 13, 17>
<12, 13, 17, 1>
<12, 18, 19, 15>
<14, 19, 18, 8>
<14, 19, 7, 11>
<16, 13, 17, 1>
<18, 19, 15, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 12, 18, 19>, chord: (12, 18)
Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 15, 19, 18>, chord: (15, 19)
Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 8, 14, 2>, chord: (8, 14)
Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 8, 3, 9>, chord: (8, 9)
Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 6, 10, 11>, chord: (6, 10)
Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 7, 11, 5>, chord: (7, 11)
Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 10, 11, 7>, chord: (10, 11)
Chordal 4-cycle: <7, 11, 5, 12>, chord: (11, 12)
Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 8, 14, 19>, chord: (8, 14)
Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 9, 4, 16>, chord: (4, 16)
Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 11, 7, 19>, chord: (11, 19)
Chordal 4-cycle: <14, 19, 7, 11>, chord: (19, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
