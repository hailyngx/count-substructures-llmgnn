Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:

1. <0, 9, 5, 2, 1>
2. <2, 5, 9, 7, 4>
3. <2, 5, 9, 14, 10>
4. <3, 9, 5, 6, 4>
5. <8, 5, 9, 7, 12>
6. <8, 5, 9, 14, 10>
7. <8, 5, 2, 6, 13>
8. <8, 5, 2, 12, 10>
9. <8, 1, 9, 7, 4>
10. <8, 1, 9, 14, 10>
11. <8, 1, 2, 6, 13>
12. <8, 1, 2, 12, 10>
13. <11, 8, 5, 9, 7>
14. <11, 8, 5, 9, 14>
15. <11, 8, 5, 2, 6>
16. <11, 8, 5, 2, 12>
17. <13, 6, 5, 9, 7>
18. <13, 6, 5, 9, 14>
19. <13, 6, 5, 2, 12>
20. <13, 6, 2, 5, 8>
21. <13, 11, 8, 5, 9>
22. <13, 11, 8, 5, 14>
23. <13, 11, 8, 5, 2>
24. <12, 7, 9, 5, 2>
25. <12, 7, 9, 14, 10>

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<0, 9, 5, 2, 1> (Chord: 9)

Step 3:
There is only one chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
