Response:
There are some chordless cycles in the given graph. Let's list them:

<3, 2, 10, 17>
<3, 2, 19, 7>
<3, 0, 16, 6>
<3, 12, 0, 16>
<3, 12, 0, 8>
<15, 9, 16, 6>
<15, 9, 16, 18>
<15, 7, 19, 18>
<15, 7, 19, 5>
<4, 14, 1, 13>
<4, 14, 1, 7>
<7, 13, 1, 14>
<7, 13, 1, 8>
<8, 14, 4, 1>
<8, 14, 1, 13>
<5, 10, 17, 2>
<5, 10, 17, 5>
<0, 3, 6, 16>
<0, 3, 6, 5>
<0, 8, 14, 4>
<0, 8, 14, 1>
<16, 6, 5, 10>
<16, 6, 5, 19>
<16, 0, 3, 12>
<16, 0, 12, 3>
<18, 8, 14, 4>
<18, 8, 14, 1>
<18, 19, 7, 13>
<18, 19, 7, 15>
<13, 7, 15, 9>
<13, 7, 15, 12>
<11, 18, 19, 7>
<11, 18, 19, 5>

Counting these chordal 4-cycles, we find that there are [32] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
