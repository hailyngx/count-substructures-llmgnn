Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- From the given graph, we can identify the following cycles:

2. (1, 6, 4, 1) of length 4
3. (1, 2, 4, 1) of length 4
4. (1, 0, 4, 1) of length 4
5. (1, 5, 3, 7, 1) of length 4
6. (2, 6, 4, 2) of length 4
7. (2, 1, 4, 2) of length 4
8. (3, 5, 4, 3) of length 4
9. (3, 7, 4, 3) of length 4
10. (4, 6, 7, 4) of length 4
11. (4, 1, 6, 4) of length 4
12. (4, 1, 5, 4) of length 4
13. (4, 2, 6, 4) of length 4
14. (4, 1, 0, 4) of length 4
15. (4, 7, 3, 5, 4) of length 4
16. (5, 1, 6, 4, 5) of length 4
17. (5, 4, 7, 3, 5) of length 4
18. (6, 4, 7, 6) of length 4
19. (6, 1, 4, 6) of length 4
20. (6, 2, 4, 6) of length 4
21. (6, 7, 4, 6) of length 4
22. (7, 4, 1, 6, 7) of length 4
23. (7, 4, 1, 5, 7) of length 4
24. (7, 3, 5, 4, 7) of length 4
25. (8, 9, 4, 8) of length 4
26. (8, 7, 4, 8) of length 4
27. (8, 3, 5, 7, 8) of length 4
28. (9, 6, 4, 9) of length 4
29. (9, 8, 7, 4, 9) of length 4
30. (0, 1, 4, 0) of length 4
31. (0, 7, 4, 0) of length 4
32. (0, 9, 4, 0) of length 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- From the identified cycles, we can see that all of them have at least one chord connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Since all identified cycles have chords, the number of chordless cycles found is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- No unique chordal 4-cycle was found in this graph.
