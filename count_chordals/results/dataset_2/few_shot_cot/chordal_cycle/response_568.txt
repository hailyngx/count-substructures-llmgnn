Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Potential cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-8-4-1
- Cycle 2: 1-8-4-5-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-5-9-1
- Cycle 4: 1-9-5-6-1
- Cycle 5: 2-4-8-5-2
- Cycle 6: 2-7-3-9-2
- Cycle 7: 2-1-8-5-2
- Cycle 8: 3-7-2-4-3
- Cycle 9: 3-9-5-4-3
- Cycle 10: 4-5-6-8-4
- Cycle 11: 4-8-5-6-4
- Cycle 12: 5-6-8-4-5
- Cycle 13: 5-8-4-6-5
- Cycle 14: 0-4-8-6-0
- Cycle 15: 0-7-3-9-0
- Cycle 16: 9-3-7-0-9
- Cycle 17: 9-5-4-0-9

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <1, (5, 8), 4, 6>
- Chordal Cycle 2: <1, (8, 5), 4, 6>
- Chordal Cycle 3: <1, (6, 5), 9, 1>
- Chordal Cycle 4: <1, (9, 5), 6, 1>
- Chordal Cycle 5: <2, (4, 8), 5, 2>
- Chordal Cycle 6: <2, (8, 4), 5, 2>
- Chordal Cycle 7: <2, (1, 8), 5, 2>
- Chordal Cycle 8: <3, (7, 2), 4, 3>
- Chordal Cycle 9: <3, (9, 5), 4, 3>
- Chordal Cycle 10: <4, (6, 8), 5, 4>

Step 3:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
