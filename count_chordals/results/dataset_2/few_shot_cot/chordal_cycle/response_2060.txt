Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <5, 1, 8, 9>. 
Let's count the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph by listing all cycles of length 4 or more:

1. <0, 1, 5, 7>
2. <0, 1, 5, 9>
3. <0, 1, 8, 9>
4. <0, 2, 4, 8>
5. <0, 3, 5, 7>
6. <0, 3, 5, 9>
7. <0, 4, 6, 8>
8. <1, 5, 7, 9>
9. <1, 5, 8, 9>
10. <3, 5, 7, 9>
11. <4, 6, 8, 9>

Out of these cycles, the following cycles have exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 5, 7> has chord (1, 5)
- <0, 1, 5, 9> has chord (1, 9)
- <0, 1, 8, 9> has chord (1, 8)
- <0, 3, 5, 7> has chord (3, 5)
- <0, 3, 5, 9> has chord (3, 5)
- <0, 4, 6, 8> has chord (4, 6)
- <1, 5, 8, 9> has chord (5, 8)
- <3, 5, 7, 9> has chord (5, 9)

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
