Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 9) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 9, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 0, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph, some of which are:
- Cycle <0, 5, 2, 1, 6>
- Cycle <0, 5, 2, 8, 7>
- Cycle <0, 5, 3, 9, 7>
- Cycle <1, 6, 4, 2, 8>
- Cycle <2, 5, 7, 9, 3>

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 5, 2, 1, 6> has a chord between nodes 2 and 1
- Cycle <0, 5, 2, 8, 7> has a chord between nodes 2 and 8
- Cycle <0, 5, 3, 9, 7> has a chord between nodes 3 and 7
- Cycle <1, 6, 4, 2, 8> has a chord between nodes 4 and 2
- Cycle <2, 5, 7, 9, 3> has a chord between nodes 5 and 9

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
The only chordless cycle is <1, 6, 4, 2, 8>, so the final count is [1].
