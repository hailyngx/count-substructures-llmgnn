Response:
Step 1:  
There are multiple cycles in the graph, but only one 4-cycle exists: <0, 18, 10, 2>.  

Step 2:  
The 4-cycle <0, 18, 10, 2> has a chord connecting nodes 18 and 10.  

Step 3:  
As there is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].  

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 18, 10, 2>.
