Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, and node 1

Node 9 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 4, 7, 1, 5>
- Cycle <0, 4, 7, 9, 2>
- Cycle <0, 4, 6, 3, 5>
- Cycle <1, 7, 4, 6, 3>
- Cycle <1, 7, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle <2, 1, 5, 8, 6>
- Cycle <2, 1, 7, 4, 6>
- Cycle <2, 8, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle <3, 0, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle <3, 0, 7, 9, 2>
- Cycle <4, 7, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle <4, 6, 3, 5, 8>
- Cycle <5, 4, 0, 3, 6>
- Cycle <6, 4, 7, 1, 5>
- Cycle <6, 8, 9, 7, 4>
- Cycle <7, 4, 0, 3, 5>
- Cycle <8, 5, 1, 7, 9>
- Cycle <8, 5, 4, 6, 3>
- Cycle <9, 7, 4, 6, 3>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 7, 1, 5> has chord (4, 1)
- <0, 4, 7, 9, 2> has chord (4, 9)
- <0, 4, 6, 3, 5> has chord (4, 3)
- <1, 7, 4, 6, 3> has chord (7, 6)
- <1, 7, 9, 8, 5> has chord (7, 8)
- <2, 1, 5, 8, 6> has chord (1, 6)
- <2, 1, 7, 4, 6> has chord (1, 4)
- <2, 8, 5, 4, 0> has chord (5, 0)
- <3, 0, 4, 6, 5> has chord (0, 6)
- <3, 0, 7, 9, 2> has chord (0, 9)
- <4, 7, 9, 8, 5> has chord (7, 5)
- <4, 6, 3, 5, 8> has chord (6, 5)
- <5, 4, 0, 3, 6> has chord (4, 3)
- <6, 4, 7, 1, 5> has chord (4, 1)
- <6, 8, 9, 7, 4> has chord (8, 7)
- <7, 4, 0, 3, 5> has chord (4, 3)
- <8, 5, 1, 7, 9> has chord (5, 7)
- <8, 5, 4, 6, 3> has chord (5, 3)
- <9, 7, 4, 6, 3> has chord (7, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless 4-cycles: [0]
