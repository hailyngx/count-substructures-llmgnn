Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 2) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: {4, 7, 5, 1, 4}
- Cycle 2: {4, 8, 1, 5, 4}
- Cycle 3: {4, 6, 1, 5, 4}
- Cycle 4: {4, 3, 6, 1, 4}
- Cycle 5: {7, 4, 3, 6, 7}
- Cycle 6: {7, 0, 2, 8, 7}
- Cycle 7: {1, 5, 7, 2, 1}
- Cycle 8: {3, 4, 8, 2, 3}
- Cycle 9: {8, 1, 6, 9, 8}

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- Chordal cycle 1: <4, 7, 5, 1, 4> (chord: 7)
- Chordal cycle 2: <4, 8, 1, 5, 4> (chord: 1)
- Chordal cycle 3: <4, 6, 1, 5, 4> (chord: 1)
- Chordal cycle 4: <4, 3, 6, 1, 4> (chord: 6)
- Chordal cycle 5: <7, 4, 3, 6, 7> (chord: 4)
- Chordal cycle 6: <7, 0, 2, 8, 7> (chord: 8)
- Chordal cycle 7: <1, 5, 7, 2, 1> (chord: 7)
- Chordal cycle 8: <3, 4, 8, 2, 3> (chord: 8)
- Chordal cycle 9: <8, 1, 6, 9, 8> (chord: 6)

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [9].
