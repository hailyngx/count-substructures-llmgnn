Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
In this graph, the chordal 4-cycles are as follows:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (0, 9, 8, 7, 4, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 4, 8, 7, 6, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 5, 8, 7, 6, 2)
- Cycle 4: (3, 9, 8, 7, 6, 3)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has chord (9, 8)
- Cycle 2 has chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 3 has chord (5, 2)
- Cycle 4 has chord (9, 3)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the count is [4].

The chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (9, 8), 0)>
<2, (4, 7), 1)>
<5, (5, 2), 8)>
<9, (9, 3), 8)>
