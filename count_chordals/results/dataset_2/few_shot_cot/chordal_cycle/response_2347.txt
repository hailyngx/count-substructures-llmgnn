Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, 5, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 3

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 8, 4, 1, 0>
2. <0, 8, 4, 7, 0>
3. <0, 8, 5, 7, 0>
4. <1, 4, 7, 8, 1>
5. <2, 7, 4, 8, 2>
6. <3, 4, 7, 3>
7. <3, 4, 6, 5, 3>
8. <3, 4, 8, 5, 3>
9. <4, 7, 3, 9, 4>
10. <5, 7, 4, 8, 5>
11. <6, 4, 8, 5, 6>
12. <7, 4, 8, 5, 7>

Step 2:  
The cycles with exactly one chord are:  
1. <0, 8, 4, 1, 0> (Chord: 4-1)
2. <2, 7, 4, 8, 2> (Chord: 4-8)
3. <3, 4, 7, 3> (Chord: 4-7)
4. <3, 4, 6, 5, 3> (Chord: 6-5)
5. <7, 4, 8, 5, 7> (Chord: 8-5)

Step 3:  
The final number of chordless 4-cycles is [7].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:  
1. <0, 8, 5, 7, 0>
2. <1, 4, 7, 8, 1>
3. <3, 4, 8, 5, 3>
4. <4, 7, 3, 9, 4>
5. <5, 7, 4, 8, 5>
6. <6, 4, 8, 5, 6>
7. <7, 4, 8, 5, 7>
