Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: (11, 16, 4, 8, 13, 9, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 16, 10, 3, 11)
- Cycle 3: (11, 4, 10, 3, 11)
- Cycle 4: (11, 9, 17, 19, 13, 9)
- Cycle 5: (11, 2, 19, 13, 9, 11)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has the chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 2 has the chord (16, 3)
- Cycle 3 has the chord (4, 10)
- Cycle 4 has the chord (17, 13)
- Cycle 5 has the chord (2, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
- There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Final answer: [5]
Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (4, 9), 8, 13, 9, 11)>
- <2, (16, 3), 11, 10, 3, 11)>
- <3, (4, 10), 11, 10, 3, 11)>
- <4, (17, 13), 9, 17, 19, 13, 9)>
- <5, (2, 9), 11, 9, 13, 19, 2)>
