Response:
Step 1: List of cycles with 4 or more nodes: 
- Cycle: <0, 1, 12, 4, 8, 13, 3, 9> 
- Cycle: <0, 1, 12, 4, 8, 13, 2, 14> 
- Cycle: <0, 1, 3, 9, 6, 10> 
- Cycle: <0, 1, 3, 9, 6, 5> 
- Cycle: <0, 1, 5, 14, 9, 6> 
- Cycle: <0, 6, 7, 8, 13, 3> 
- Cycle: <0, 7, 8, 13, 3, 9> 
- Cycle: <1, 3, 9, 6, 5, 14> 
- Cycle: <1, 3, 9, 6, 7, 8> 
- Cycle: <1, 3, 13, 8, 7, 0> 
- Cycle: <1, 5, 6, 9, 3, 13> 
- Cycle: <2, 4, 12, 1, 0, 7> 
- Cycle: <2, 4, 12, 11, 1, 0> 
- Cycle: <2, 8, 13, 3, 9, 14> 
- Cycle: <3, 9, 14, 8, 4, 12> 
- Cycle: <3, 13, 8, 14, 5, 6> 

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 1, 12, 4, 8, 13, 3, 9> (Chord: (1, 13))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 1, 12, 4, 8, 13, 3, 9>.
