Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 5) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 5) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 0, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<0, 4, 6, 2, 0>
<0, 4, 6, 9, 0>
<0, 4, 8, 9, 0>
<0, 5, 4, 6, 0>
<0, 5, 2, 7, 0>
<0, 5, 3, 2, 0>
<0, 7, 2, 6, 0>
<1, 5, 4, 0, 1>
<2, 3, 5, 4, 2>
<2, 4, 6, 9, 2>
<2, 4, 8, 9, 2>
<2, 5, 4, 6, 2>
<2, 5, 0, 7, 2>
<2, 6, 4, 9, 2>
<3, 5, 4, 6, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

<0, 4, 6, 2, 0> has a chord <4, 6>
<0, 4, 6, 9, 0> has a chord <4, 9>
<0, 4, 8, 9, 0> has a chord <4, 9>
<0, 5, 4, 6, 0> has a chord <4, 6>
<0, 7, 2, 6, 0> has a chord <2, 6>
<1, 5, 4, 0, 1> has a chord <4, 5>
<2, 3, 5, 4, 2> has a chord <3, 4>
<2, 4, 8, 9, 2> has a chord <8, 9>
<3, 5, 4, 6, 3> has a chord <4, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

[0] (There are no chordless 4-cycles in this graph)
