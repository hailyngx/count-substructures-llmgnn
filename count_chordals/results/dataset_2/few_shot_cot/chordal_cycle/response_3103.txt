Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph, such as:
- Cycle 1: 0-11-16-2-0
- Cycle 2: 3-15-9-0-3
- Cycle 3: 3-15-6-19-3
- Cycle 4: 4-7-19-6-4

Step 2:
Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 does not have a chord.
- Cycle 2 has a chord 9 connecting nodes 15 and 0.
- Cycle 3 has a chord 6 connecting nodes 15 and 19.
- Cycle 4 does not have a chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [2].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, 11, 16, 2> (with chord (0, 2))
- <3, 15, 9, 0> (with chord (15, 0))
- <3, 15, 6, 19> (with chord (15, 19))
- <4, 7, 19, 6>
