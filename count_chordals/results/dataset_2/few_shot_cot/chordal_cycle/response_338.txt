Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 5, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 3, 6, 5, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 5, 2, 3, 8, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 1, 5, 6, 3, 2>
- Cycle 5: <2, 5, 9, 8, 0, 2>
- Cycle 6: <3, 9, 5, 8, 1, 3>
- Cycle 7: <4, 7, 0, 9, 5, 4>
- Cycle 8: <5, 2, 3, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 9: <6, 5, 9, 8, 2, 6>
- Cycle 10: <7, 4, 7>
- Cycle 11: <7, 9, 8, 0, 7>
- Cycle 12: <8, 5, 9, 3, 6, 8>
- Cycle 13: <9, 5, 1, 7, 0, 9>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 5, 1, 0> has chord (9, 1)
- <0, 9, 3, 6, 5, 0> has chord (9, 6)
- <1, 5, 2, 3, 8, 1> has chord (5, 3)
- <2, 1, 5, 6, 3, 2> has chord (1, 6)
- <2, 5, 9, 8, 0, 2> has chord (5, 8)
- <3, 9, 5, 8, 1, 3> has chord (9, 1)
- <4, 7, 0, 9, 5, 4> has chord (7, 5)
- <5, 2, 3, 9, 8, 5> has chord (2, 9)
- <6, 5, 9, 8, 2, 6> has chord (5, 8)
- <7, 9, 8, 0, 7> has chord (9, 8)
- <8, 5, 9, 3, 6, 8> has chord (5, 3)
- <9, 5, 1, 7, 0, 9> has chord (5, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 9, 5, 1>
<2, 1, 5, 6>
