Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles with length 4 in the graph are:

1. Cycle: 0-1-4-5-0
2. Cycle: 0-1-6-7-5-0
3. Cycle: 0-2-3-5-0
4. Cycle: 0-2-8-7-5-0
5. Cycle: 0-4-5-6-7-0
6. Cycle: 0-5-6-8-0
7. Cycle: 0-9-8-7-5-0
8. Cycle: 1-4-5-6-1
9. Cycle: 1-5-7-8-1
10. Cycle: 1-6-8-9-1
11. Cycle: 2-3-5-7-2
12. Cycle: 2-3-6-8-2
13. Cycle: 2-8-9-0-2
14. Cycle: 3-5-6-8-3
15. Cycle: 4-5-7-8-4
16. Cycle: 5-6-7-8-5
17. Cycle: 6-7-8-9-6
18. Cycle: 7-8-9-0-7

Step 2:
The only cycle with a chord is:
- Cycle: 0-1-6-7-5-0 (Chord: (1, 7))

Step 3:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, which is <0, 1, (1, 7), 6>.

Thus, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
