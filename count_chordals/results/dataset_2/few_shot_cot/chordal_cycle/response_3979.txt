1. <0, 7, 26, 1, 24>
2. <0, 7, 26, 16, 5>
3. <0, 7, 3, 2, 18>

11. <0, 7, 6, 17, 15>
12. <0, 10, 4, 10, 21>
13. <0, 10, 4, 10, 0>
14. <0, 10, 21, 10, 4>

35. <6, 13, 22, 23, 19>
36. <6, 7, 3, 18, 29>
37. <6, 7, 3, 18, 20>
38. <6, 7, 26, 16, 5>
39. <6, 15, 24, 1, 26>
40. <6, 15, 28, 20, 25>
41. <9, 0, 10, 4, 10>
42. <9, 0, 7, 6, 15>
43. <9, 25, 20, 28, 15>
44. <9, 25, 19, 23, 22>
45. <9, 25, 19, 23, 12>
46. <10, 4, 10, 0, 7>
47. <11, 23, 19, 25, 20>
48. <14, 12, 23, 19, 25>
49. <18, 20, 25, 19, 14>
50. <18, 20, 29, 5, 16>
51. <18, 20, 29, 5, 18>
52. <20, 25, 19, 23, 22>

Next, we need to check each cycle for exactly one chord. This will reveal the unique chordal 4-cycle found:

- <0, 7, 26, 16, 5> has a chord (16, 5). This is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <0, 7, 3, 18, 29> has a chord (18, 29). This is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <2, 3, 18, 20, 28> has a chord (3, 20). This is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <2, 3, 18, 20, 25> has a chord (3, 20). This is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <6, 7, 26, 16, 5> has a chord (7, 16). This is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <6, 13, 22, 23, 11> has a chord (13, 23). This is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <6, 13, 22, 23, 12> has a chord (13, 23). This is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <6, 13, 22, 23, 19> has a chord (13, 23). This is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <9, 25, 19, 23, 22> has a chord (25, 23). This is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <18, 20, 25, 19, 14> has a chord (20, 19). This is a chordal 4-cycle.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
