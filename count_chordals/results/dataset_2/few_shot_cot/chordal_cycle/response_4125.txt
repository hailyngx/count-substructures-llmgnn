Response:
Let's start by listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <5, 9, 6, 5>
2. <5, 9, 0, 5>
3. <5, 9, 6, 1, 5>
4. <5, 9, 6, 3, 5>
5. <5, 6, 1, 8, 5>
6. <5, 6, 1, 2, 5>
7. <5, 6, 3, 7, 5>
8. <5, 2, 1, 6, 5>
9. <5, 2, 1, 7, 5>
10. <5, 2, 3, 7, 5>
11. <5, 4, 0, 5>
12. <5, 3, 7, 6, 5>
13. <5, 3, 2, 1, 5>
14. <5, 3, 6, 1, 5>
15. <9, 6, 5, 2, 9>
16. <9, 6, 5, 4, 9>
17. <9, 6, 1, 7, 9>
18. <9, 0, 5, 4, 9>
19. <6, 5, 2, 1, 6>
20. <6, 5, 2, 7, 6>
21. <6, 5, 4, 0, 6>
22. <6, 5, 0, 9, 6>
23. <6, 1, 7, 3, 6>
24. <6, 1, 2, 5, 6>
25. <6, 1, 8, 7, 6>
26. <6, 3, 7, 1, 6>
27. <6, 3, 2, 5, 6>
28. <4, 5, 0, 9, 4>
29. <4, 5, 6, 1, 4>
30. <4, 5, 6, 3, 4>
31. <1, 6, 5, 2, 1>
32. <1, 6, 5, 9, 1>
33. <1, 6, 3, 7, 1>
34. <1, 8, 7, 3, 1>
35. <1, 8, 7, 6, 1>
36. <1, 2, 5, 6, 1>
37. <1, 2, 5, 3, 1>
38. <1, 2, 7, 6, 1>
39. <3, 5, 2, 1, 3>
40. <3, 5, 2, 7, 3>
41. <3, 5, 6, 1, 3>
42. <3, 7, 1, 6, 3>
43. <3, 7, 1, 2, 3>
44. <3, 7, 6, 5, 3>
45. <7, 6, 5, 2, 7>
46. <7, 6, 5, 9, 7>
47. <7, 6, 1, 2, 7>
48. <7, 1, 2, 5, 7>
49. <7, 1, 2, 3, 7>
50. <0, 5, 4, 6, 0>

Next, let's identify the unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph:

1. <5, 9, 6, 5> with chord (9, 6)
2. <5, 6, 1, 8, 5> with chord (1, 8)
3. <5, 3, 7, 6, 5> with chord (7, 3)
4. <5, 4, 0, 5> with chord (4, 0)
5. <9, 6, 5, 2, 9> with chord (6, 2)
6. <6, 5, 2, 1, 6> with chord (2, 1)
7. <6, 5, 4, 0, 6> with chord (5, 4)
8. <1, 6, 5, 2, 1> with chord (6, 2)
9. <1, 8, 7, 3, 1> with chord (8, 7)
10. <3, 5, 2, 1, 3> with chord (5, 1)

Since all identified 4-cycles are chordal cycles, the count of chordless cycles is [0].
