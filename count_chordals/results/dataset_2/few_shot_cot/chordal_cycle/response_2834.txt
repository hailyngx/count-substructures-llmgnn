Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. (1, 7, 13, 11, 1)
2. (1, 7, 13, 12, 1)
3. (1, 10, 3, 5, 1)
4. (1, 10, 2, 4, 1)
5. (1, 11, 6, 4, 1)
6. (2, 4, 6, 5, 2)
7. (2, 4, 6, 11, 2)
8. (2, 4, 7, 12, 2)
9. (2, 6, 11, 0, 2)
10. (2, 6, 11, 13, 2)
11. (2, 6, 5, 13, 2)
12. (3, 5, 4, 6, 3)
13. (3, 5, 13, 7, 3)
14. (3, 8, 12, 7, 3)
15. (3, 10, 2, 6, 3)
16. (6, 4, 7, 12, 6)
17. (6, 11, 13, 7, 6)
18. (7, 4, 5, 13, 7)
19. (7, 9, 0, 11, 7)
20. (12, 7, 4, 5, 12)
21. (12, 7, 13, 11, 12)
22. (12, 8, 3, 5, 12)
23. (12, 8, 2, 4, 12)
24. (13, 7, 4, 6, 13)
25. (13, 7, 12, 8, 13)
26. (14, 2, 6, 5, 14)
27. (14, 2, 10, 1, 14)
28. (14, 12, 7, 4, 14)

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are as follows:
1. <2, (6, 5), 4, 14>
2. <2, (6, 11), 13, 7>
3. <4, (7, 12), 5, 13>
4. <7, (13, 11), 12, 4>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [24].
