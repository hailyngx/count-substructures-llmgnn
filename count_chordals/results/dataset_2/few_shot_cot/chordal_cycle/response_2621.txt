Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle with 4 nodes: <1, 3, 5, 7, 1>
- Cycle with 4 nodes: <1, 5, 8, 2, 1>
- Cycle with 4 nodes: <2, 5, 8, 4, 2>
- Cycle with 4 nodes: <3, 5, 8, 0, 3>
- Cycle with 4 nodes: <3, 5, 2, 9, 3>
- Cycle with 4 nodes: <5, 8, 4, 9, 5>
- Cycle with 4 nodes: <7, 5, 3, 1, 7>
- Cycle with 4 nodes: <7, 2, 5, 8, 7>

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 3, 5, 7, 1>  Chord: (3, 5)
- <7, 2, 5, 8, 7>  Chord: (2, 8)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]
