Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 6) (9, 1) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1:  
Potential cycles of length 4 or more:  
1. <0, 4, 8, 5, 0>  
2. <1, 3, 7, 5, 1>  

Step 2:  
Checking for chords in the potential cycles:  
1. <0, 4, 8, 5, 0> - (4, 8) is a chord.  
2. <1, 3, 7, 5, 1> - No chord present.  

Step 3:  
Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]  

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:  
<0, 4, 8, 5, 0>
