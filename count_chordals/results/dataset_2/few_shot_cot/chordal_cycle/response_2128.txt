Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- Cycle <0, 6, 12, 13>
- Cycle <1, 4, 6, 7>
- Cycle <1, 4, 6, 14>
- Cycle <1, 5, 12, 14>
- Cycle <2, 4, 10, 13>
- Cycle <2, 5, 11, 13>
- Cycle <2, 9, 13, 14>
- Cycle <3, 9, 13, 10>
- Cycle <5, 8, 7, 6>
- Cycle <5, 8, 7, 1>
- Cycle <5, 10, 13, 9>
- Cycle <5, 10, 4, 1>
- Cycle <8, 7, 1, 4>
- Cycle <11, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle <11, 3, 9, 13>
- Cycle <11, 5, 14, 0>

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are as follows:
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 4, 6, 7> (Chord: (4, 6))
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 5, 12, 14> (Chord: (5, 12))
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 4, 10, 13> (Chord: (4, 10))
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 9, 13, 14> (Chord: (9, 14))
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 9, 13, 10> (Chord: (9, 10))
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 8, 7, 6> (Chord: (7, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle <11, 3, 1, 4> (Chord: (3, 1))
- Chordal 4-cycle <11, 5, 14, 0> (Chord: (5, 14))

Step 3: 
In total, there are [8] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
