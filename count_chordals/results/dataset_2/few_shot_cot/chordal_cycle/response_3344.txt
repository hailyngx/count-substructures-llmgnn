Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 5, 11>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 9, 17>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 13, 15>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 6, 9>
- Cycle 5: <0, 8, 11, 16>
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 17, 5>
- Cycle 7: <1, 12, 11, 16>
- Cycle 8: <1, 13, 2, 7>
- Cycle 9: <1, 15, 14, 18>
- Cycle 10: <3, 5, 17, 9>
- Cycle 11: <3, 6, 9, 1>
- Cycle 12: <4, 6, 9, 17>
- Cycle 13: <4, 6, 5, 11>
- Cycle 14: <4, 10, 5, 11>
- Cycle 15: <5, 10, 4, 6>
- Cycle 16: <8, 11, 16, 13>
- Cycle 17: <11, 12, 1, 9>
- Cycle 18: <11, 12, 19, 11>
- Cycle 19: <12, 1, 13, 16>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The only chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 9, 17, 5> with chord (9, 17).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 18 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
