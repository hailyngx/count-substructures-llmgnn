Step 2: Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (6, 5), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (4, 7), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, (9, 7), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, (0, 4), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, (7, 9), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (5, 9), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6, (13, 3), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, (13, 10), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <8, (14, 10), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <11, (14, 10), 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <12, (3, 0), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <12, (3, 7), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <12, (10, 13), 3>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 13 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [13].
