Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 4, 7, 13, 5> (chordless)
- <0, 4, 7, 13, 11> (chordless)
- <0, 4, 7, 14, 13> (chordless)
- <0, 4, 7, 14, 9> (chordless)
- <0, 7, 13, 5, 6> (chordless)
- <0, 7, 13, 5, 11> (chordless)
- <1, 5, 11, 13, 7> (chordless)
- <1, 5, 13, 7, 14> (chordless)
- <2, 5, 13, 7, 14> (chordless)
- <2, 5, 13, 9, 12> (chordless)
- <3, 5, 13, 7, 14> (chordless)
- <3, 5, 11, 13, 7> (chordless)
- <3, 5, 11, 1, 9> (chordless)
- <3, 8, 12, 9, 13> (chordless)
- <6, 5, 13, 7, 14> (chordless)
- <6, 5, 11, 13, 7> (chordless)
- <6, 12, 8, 14, 7> (chordless)
- <6, 12, 9, 13, 7> (chordless)
- <8, 0, 4, 7, 13> (chordless)
- <8, 0, 7, 13, 5> (chordless)
- <8, 0, 7, 14, 9> (chordless)
- <8, 0, 7, 14, 13> (chordless)
- <8, 3, 5, 13, 7> (chordless)
- <9, 1, 5, 13, 7> (chordless)
- <9, 1, 11, 13, 7> (chordless)
- <9, 3, 5, 13, 7> (chordless)
- <9, 3, 5, 11, 13> (chordless)
- <10, 6, 5, 13, 7> (chordless)
- <10, 6, 12, 9, 13> (chordless)
- <12, 3, 5, 13, 7> (chordless)
- <12, 3, 5, 11, 13> (chordless)
- <12, 6, 5, 13, 7> (chordless)
- <14, 7, 13, 5, 11> (chordless)
- <14, 8, 12, 9, 13> (chordless)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 7, 13, 5> (Chord: (7, 13))
- <0, 4, 7, 13, 11> (Chord: (4, 11))
- <0, 4, 7, 14, 13> (Chord: (7, 13))
- <0, 4, 7, 14, 9> (Chord: (4, 9))
- <3, 8, 12, 9, 13> (Chord: (8, 9))
- <10, 6, 5, 13, 7> (Chord: (6, 13))
- <14, 8, 12, 9, 13> (Chord: (8, 9))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are <29> unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
