Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 0) with edges (5, 9), (9, 6), (6, 0), (0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 2, 7) with edges (1, 6), (6, 2), (2, 7), (7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 2, 1) with edges (4, 7), (7, 2), (2, 1), (1, 4)
- Cycle 4: (3, 11, 12, 14) with edges (3, 11), (11, 12), (12, 14), (14, 3)
- Cycle 5: (9, 8, 14, 12) with edges (9, 8), (8, 14), (14, 12), (12, 9)
- Cycle 6: (4, 10, 2, 7) with edges (4, 10), (10, 2), (2, 7), (7, 4)
- Cycle 7: (5, 0, 6, 1) with edges (5, 0), (0, 6), (6, 1), (1, 5)
- Cycle 8: (4, 12, 14, 8) with edges (4, 12), (12, 14), (14, 8), (8, 4)
- Cycle 9: (11, 5, 0, 6) with edges (11, 5), (5, 0), (0, 6), (6, 11)
- Cycle 10: (13, 9, 8, 14) with edges (13, 9), (9, 8), (8, 14), (14, 13)
- Cycle 11: (4, 8, 14, 12) with edges (4, 8), (8, 14), (14, 12), (12, 4)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Cycle 1: Chordless
- Cycle 2: Chordless
- Cycle 3: Chordless
- Cycle 4: Chordless
- Cycle 5: Chordless
- Cycle 6: Chordless
- Cycle 7: Chordless
- Cycle 8: Chordless
- Cycle 9: <9, (5, 11), 6>
- Cycle 10: Chordless
- Cycle 11: <11, (13, 12), 8>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [2].
