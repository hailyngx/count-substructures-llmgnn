Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with all existing edges:

- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 13, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 4, 13, 5, 2)
- Cycle 3: (3, 5, 13, 4, 3)
- Cycle 4: (6, 12, 4, 13, 6)
- Cycle 5: (8, 6, 12, 4, 8)
- Cycle 6: (9, 14, 4, 13, 9)
- Cycle 7: (10, 12, 4, 13, 10)
- Cycle 8: (11, 13, 4, 12, 11)
- Cycle 9: (11, 13, 7, 2, 9)
- Cycle 10: (1, 4, 12, 6, 1)
- Cycle 11: (10, 3, 9, 8, 6, 10)
- Cycle 12: (10, 14, 9, 3, 5, 13, 12, 10)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (2, 4), 13, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, (5, 13), 4, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, (8, 12), 4, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (10, 12), 4, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <11, (7, 13), 13, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (10, 12), 4, 6>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [6]
