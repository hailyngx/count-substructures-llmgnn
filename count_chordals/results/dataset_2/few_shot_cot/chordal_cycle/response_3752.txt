Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:

1. <1, 3, 7, 19>
2. <1, 3, 19, 4>
3. <1, 16, 10, 15>
4. <3, 1, 16, 10>
5. <3, 19, 15, 10>
6. <9, 1, 16, 10>
7. <9, 0, 14, 4>
8. <9, 0, 14, 2>
9. <9, 18, 5, 11>
10. <9, 18, 5, 6>
11. <18, 5, 11, 2>
12. <18, 5, 11, 12>
13. <18, 5, 6, 12>
14. <18, 6, 12, 11>
15. <18, 17, 2, 11>
16. <18, 17, 2, 14>
17. <18, 17, 2, 8>
18. <18, 17, 16, 10>
19. <18, 17, 16, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
Let's identify the chordal 4-cycle:
- <1, 3, 7, 19> has no chord.
- <1, 3, 19, 4> has a chord: (1, 4).
- <1, 16, 10, 15> has no chord.
- <3, 1, 16, 10> has a chord: (3, 10).
- <3, 19, 15, 10> has a chord: (3, 15).
- <9, 1, 16, 10> has no chord.
- <9, 0, 14, 4> has no chord.
- <9, 0, 14, 2> has a chord: (9, 14).
- <9, 18, 5, 11> has no chord.
- <9, 18, 5, 6> has a chord: (9, 6).
- <18, 5, 11, 2> has no chord.
- <18, 5, 11, 12> has a chord: (5, 11).
- <18, 5, 6, 12> has a chord: (5, 12).
- <18, 6, 12, 11> has a chord: (6, 11).
- <18, 17, 2, 11> has a chord: (2, 11).
- <18, 17, 2, 14> has a chord: (2, 14).
- <18, 17, 2, 8> has a chord: (2, 8).
- <18, 17, 16, 10> has no chord.
- <18, 17, 16, 13> has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles: [7]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <1, 3, 19, 4> with chord (1, 4)
- <3, 1, 16, 10> with chord (3, 10)
- <3, 19, 15, 10> with chord (3, 15)
- <9, 0, 14, 2> with chord (9, 14)
- <9, 18, 5, 6> with chord (9, 6)
- <18, 5, 11, 12> with chord (5, 12)
- <18, 6, 12, 11> with chord (6, 11)
