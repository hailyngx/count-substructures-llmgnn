Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
  - Cycle 1: <0, 5, 2, 7>
  - Cycle 2: <0, 5, 18, 6>
  - Cycle 3: <0, 18, 16, 15>
  - Cycle 4: <1, 10, 3, 6>
  - Cycle 5: <1, 13, 4, 8>
  - Cycle 6: <2, 16, 15, 17>
  - Cycle 7: <4, 13, 1, 10>
  - Cycle 8: <4, 13, 14, 2>
  - Cycle 9: <4, 17, 15, 16>
  - Cycle 10: <5, 18, 16, 15>
  - Cycle 11: <6, 18, 16, 15>
  - Cycle 12: <8, 0, 5, 2>
  - Cycle 13: <8, 0, 18, 6>
  - Cycle 14: <8, 1, 10, 3>
  - Cycle 15: <8, 1, 13, 4>
  - Cycle 16: <9, 16, 15, 17>
  - Cycle 17: <11, 4, 13, 1>
  - Cycle 18: <12, 15, 17, 4>
  
Step 2:
- Among these cycles, the following cycles have exactly one chord:
  - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <<0, 18>, (5, 2), 7>
  - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <<1, 13>, (10, 3), 4>
  - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <<4, 17>, (15, 16), 11>
  
Step 3:
- The number of chordless cycles found is [15].
