Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 2, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 9, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (2, 5, 4, 9, 2)
- Cycle 4: (3, 8, 7, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 4, 5, 6, 3)
- Cycle 6: (0, 9, 4, 8, 0)
- Cycle 7: (1, 9, 0, 8, 1)
- Cycle 8: (6, 5, 4, 3, 6)
- Cycle 9: (7, 3, 6, 2, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- The cycle <5, 2, 6, 5> has a chord (5, 6)
- The cycle <5, 1, 9, 4, 5> has a chord (1, 4)
- The cycle <2, 5, 4, 9, 2> has a chord (5, 9)
- The cycle <3, 8, 7, 3> has a chord (8, 7)
- The cycle <3, 4, 5, 6, 3> has a chord (4, 6)
- The cycle <0, 9, 4, 8, 0> has a chord (9, 8)
- The cycle <1, 9, 0, 8, 1> has a chord (9, 8)
- The cycle <6, 5, 4, 3, 6> has a chord (5, 3)
- The cycle <7, 3, 6, 2, 7> has a chord (3, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
