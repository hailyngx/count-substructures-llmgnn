Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <4, 6, 8, 7, 5>
- Cycle 2: <3, 9, 6, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <3, 9, 4, 6, 7>
- Cycle 4: <3, 9, 6, 7, 5>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 4, 9, 5>
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 7, 5, 3>
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 7, 2, 8>
- Cycle 8: <1, 6, 3, 9, 5>
- Cycle 9: <1, 4, 9, 6, 7>
- Cycle 10: <1, 4, 6, 7, 5>
- Cycle 11: <1, 4, 6, 9, 5>
- Cycle 12: <1, 7, 5, 9, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <4, 6, 8, 7, 5> - Chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 2: <3, 9, 6, 4, 0> - Chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 3: <3, 9, 4, 6, 7> - Chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 4: <3, 9, 6, 7, 5> - Chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 4, 9, 5> - Chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 7, 5, 3> - Chord: (6, 5)
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 7, 2, 8> - Chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 8: <1, 6, 3, 9, 5> - Chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 9: <1, 4, 9, 6, 7> - Chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 10: <1, 4, 6, 7, 5> - Chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 11: <1, 4, 6, 9, 5> - Chord: (4, 5)
- Cycle 12: <1, 7, 5, 9, 3> - Chord: (7, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [12]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, 6, 8, 7, 5>
- <3, 9, 6, 4, 0>
- <3, 9, 4, 6, 7>
- <3, 9, 6, 7, 5>
- <1, 6, 4, 9, 5>
- <1, 6, 7, 5, 3>
- <1, 6, 7, 2, 8>
- <1, 6, 3, 9, 5>
- <1, 4, 9, 6, 7>
- <1, 4, 6, 7, 5>
- <1, 4, 6, 9, 5>
- <1, 7, 5, 9, 3>
