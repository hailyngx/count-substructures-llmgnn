Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 2, 20, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 28, 16, 11>
- Cycle 3: <0, 8, 28, 14, 2>
- Cycle 4: <1, 21, 10, 7, 12>
- Cycle 5: <1, 21, 13, 26, 19>
- Cycle 6: <2, 29, 16, 11, 27>
- Cycle 7: <3, 23, 10, 21, 1>
- Cycle 8: <5, 27, 1, 20, 2>
- Cycle 9: <5, 27, 17, 19, 26>
- Cycle 10: <5, 23, 10, 7, 12>
- Cycle 11: <5, 23, 9, 8, 28>
- Cycle 12: <6, 24, 6, 25, 28>
- Cycle 13: <6, 22, 15, 11, 27>
- Cycle 14: <7, 10, 21, 13, 26>
- Cycle 15: <9, 23, 3, 4, 0>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 8, 2, 20, 1> has no chord
- <0, 8, 28, 16, 11> has a chord 16-28
- <0, 8, 28, 14, 2> has a chord 8-14
- <1, 21, 10, 7, 12> has no chord
- <1, 21, 13, 26, 19> has no chord
- <2, 29, 16, 11, 27> has a chord 11-16
- <3, 23, 10, 21, 1> has no chord
- <5, 27, 1, 20, 2> has no chord
- <5, 27, 17, 19, 26> has no chord
- <5, 23, 10, 7, 12> has no chord
- <5, 23, 9, 8, 28> has no chord
- <6, 24, 6, 25, 28> has no chord
- <6, 22, 15, 11, 27> has a chord 15-22
- <7, 10, 21, 13, 26> has a chord 13-21
- <9, 23, 3, 4, 0> has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which are:
- <0, 8, 2, 20, 1>
- <1, 21, 10, 7, 12>
- <1, 21, 13, 26, 19>
- <3, 23, 10, 21, 1>
- <5, 27, 1, 20, 2>
- <5, 27, 17, 19, 26>
- <5, 23, 10, 7, 12>
- <5, 23, 9, 8, 28>
- <6, 24, 6, 25, 28>
- <9, 23, 3, 4, 0>

So, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
