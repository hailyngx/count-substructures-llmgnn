Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more with all edges existing in the given graph.

Step 2: 
- There is one chordal 4-cycle in the graph with exactly one chord: (6, 9, 1, 2) and chord (1, 2).

Step 3:
- Based on the above information, the number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].
