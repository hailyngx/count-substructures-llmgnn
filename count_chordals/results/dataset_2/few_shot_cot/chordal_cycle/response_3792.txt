Node 2 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 11, 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, 13, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 10, 2, 14, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, 2, 14, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 14, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 11, 4, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 10, 11, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 0, 13, 9, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 3, 10, 0, 9, and node 8
Node 12 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 10, 4, and node 14

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 10, 5, 14, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 10, 11, 3, 1, 9, 14, 0>
- Cycle 3: <2, 5, 10, 13, 4, 3, 6, 7, 2>
- Cycle 4: <2, 7, 6, 3, 4, 13, 14, 5, 2>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <0, 10, 5, 14, 0> has 1 chord: (10, 5)
- Cycle 2: <0, 10, 11, 3, 1, 9, 14, 0> has 1 chord: (11, 9)
- Cycle 3: <2, 5, 10, 13, 4, 3, 6, 7, 2> has 1 chord: (10, 3)
- Cycle 4: <2, 7, 6, 3, 4, 13, 14, 5, 2> has 1 chord: (6, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.
Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
