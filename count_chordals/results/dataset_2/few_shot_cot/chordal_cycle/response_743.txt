Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 10, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 14, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 13, 12, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, 11, 9, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 2, 6, 10, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 6, 10, 1>
- Cycle 8: <3, 4, 11, 9, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 4, 0, 7, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 6, 14, 7, 3>
- Cycle 11: <3, 13, 0, 7, 3>
- Cycle 12: <6, 2, 11, 10, 6>
- Cycle 13: <6, 10, 13, 12, 6>
- Cycle 14: <7, 14, 8, 1, 7>
- Cycle 15: <7, 14, 12, 13, 7>
- Cycle 16: <9, 11, 2, 1, 9>
- Cycle 17: <9, 11, 4, 3, 9>
- Cycle 18: <9, 12, 13, 10, 9>
- Cycle 19: <11, 4, 0, 7, 11>
- Cycle 20: <13, 0, 7, 10, 13>
- Cycle 21: <13, 12, 14, 8, 13>

Step 2: Checking for chordal 4-cycles:
From the cycles listed above, only one of them is a chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <<0, 7, 10, 6, 0>, (7, 10)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
