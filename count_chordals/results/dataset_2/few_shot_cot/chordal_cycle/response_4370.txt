Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 10, 9, 23>
- Cycle 2: <1, 24, 26, 3>
- Cycle 3: <4, 8, 12, 19>
- Cycle 4: <5, 18, 15, 28>
- Cycle 5: <6, 13, 28, 15>
- Cycle 6: <7, 1, 27, 11>
- Cycle 7: <11, 22, 23, 9>
- Cycle 8: <12, 19, 3, 26>
- Cycle 9: <13, 9, 23, 22>
- Cycle 10: <15, 24, 26, 11>
- Cycle 11: <16, 5, 18, 15>
- Cycle 12: <17, 14, 29, 28>
- Cycle 13: <20, 8, 4, 23>
- Cycle 14: <21, 18, 5, 16>
- Cycle 15: <25, 0, 10, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Chordal cycle 1: <13, 9, 23, 22> (Chord: (13, 22))
- Chordal cycle 2: <5, 18, 15, 28> (Chord: (18, 28))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
