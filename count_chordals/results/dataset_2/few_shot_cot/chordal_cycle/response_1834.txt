Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 16, 12, 2, 5, 11, 10>
2. <0, 16, 14, 9, 15, 19, 10>
3. <0, 8, 7, 12, 2, 5, 11>
4. <0, 8, 17, 18, 15, 9, 14>
5. <0, 8, 17, 18, 11, 5, 2>
6. <0, 9, 15, 13, 4, 19, 10>
7. <2, 6, 11, 10, 19, 15, 13>
8. <2, 12, 7, 8, 17, 18, 11>
9. <5, 3, 13, 15, 18, 17, 9>
10. <5, 11, 10, 19, 4, 13, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <0, 16, 12, 2, 5, 11, 10> has a chord (2, 11)
- Cycle 2: <0, 16, 14, 9, 15, 19, 10> has a chord (9, 10)
- Cycle 3: <0, 8, 7, 12, 2, 5, 11> has a chord (7, 11)
- Cycle 4: <0, 8, 17, 18, 15, 9, 14> has a chord (17, 9)
- Cycle 5: <0, 8, 17, 18, 11, 5, 2> has a chord (8, 18)
- Cycle 6: <0, 9, 15, 13, 4, 19, 10> has a chord (9, 19)
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 11, 10, 19, 15, 13> has a chord (6, 15)
- Cycle 8: <2, 12, 7, 8, 17, 18, 11> has a chord (12, 18)
- Cycle 9: <5, 3, 13, 15, 18, 17, 9> has a chord (3, 15)
- Cycle 10: <5, 11, 10, 19, 4, 13, 3> has a chord (11, 4)

Step 3:
There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
