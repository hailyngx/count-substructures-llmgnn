Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, 1, 4, 11>, chord = (1, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <16, 25, 19, 4>, chord = (25, 19)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, 27, 20, 26>, chord = (27, 20)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <8, 13, 3, 27>, chord = (13, 27)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 28, 24, 14>, chord = (28, 24)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 30 chordless 4-cycles present in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [5].
