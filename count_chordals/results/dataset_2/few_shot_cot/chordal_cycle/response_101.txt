Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 7

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <0, 5, 1, 2>.

Following the step-by-step process described earlier:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 with existing edges: 
- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 1, 7)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 1, 2)
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 3, 2)
- Cycle 5: (1, 5, 0, 4)
- Cycle 6: (2, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 7: (3, 5, 1, 2)
- Cycle 8: (4, 6, 7, 0)
- Cycle 9: (4, 6, 8, 0)
- Cycle 10: (6, 4, 0, 5)
- Cycle 11: (6, 4, 7, 0)
- Cycle 12: (6, 7, 9, 8)
- Cycle 13: (7, 1, 5, 3)
- Cycle 14: (7, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 15: (7, 1, 3, 2)
- Cycle 16: (7, 0, 5, 3)
- Cycle 17: (7, 0, 4, 6)
- Cycle 18: (7, 0, 5, 1)
- Cycle 19: (7, 4, 6, 8)
- Cycle 20: (9, 6, 4, 0)
- Cycle 21: (9, 6, 8, 4)
- Cycle 22: (9, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 23: (9, 7, 1, 5)
- Cycle 24: (9, 7, 0, 5)

Step 2: Identify the cycle with exactly one chord:
The cycle (0, 5, 1, 2) has exactly one chord, which is the edge (1, 2).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
Since there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle identified, the count is [1].
