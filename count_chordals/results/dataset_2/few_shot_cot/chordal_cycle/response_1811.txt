Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, 8, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-8-6-0
- Cycle 2: 1-9-5-7-1
- Cycle 3: 5-6-4-3-5
- Cycle 4: 6-8-4-3-6
- Cycle 5: 2-9-1-8-2
- Cycle 6: 0-8-4-3-0
- Cycle 7: 0-8-6-5-0
- Cycle 8: 5-7-6-3-5
- Cycle 9: 5-2-6-3-5
- Cycle 10: 8-1-9-5-8

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle) are:
- <1, (9, 7), 5>
- <5, (6, 2), 9>
- <6, (8, 4), 3>
- <8, (1, 9), 5>

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the number of chordless cycles found is [6].
