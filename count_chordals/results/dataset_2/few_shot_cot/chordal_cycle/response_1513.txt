Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle <0, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle <0, 3, 1, 5>
- Cycle <1, 5, 9, 4>
- Cycle <1, 5, 14, 9>
- Cycle <1, 5, 4, 9>
- Cycle <1, 5, 14, 7>
- Cycle <1, 6, 10, 2>
- Cycle <2, 9, 5, 4>
- Cycle <2, 9, 11, 13>
- Cycle <3, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle <3, 7, 14, 9>
- Cycle <3, 7, 14, 5>
- Cycle <4, 5, 14, 7>
- Cycle <8, 1, 5, 9>
- Cycle <8, 1, 6, 10>
- Cycle <8, 1, 3, 7>
- Cycle <8, 1, 5, 4>
- Cycle <8, 12, 7, 4>
- Cycle <8, 12, 7, 14>
- Cycle <9, 5, 14, 7>
- Cycle <9, 5, 4, 7>
- Cycle <9, 11, 13, 3>
- Cycle <11, 9, 14, 5>
- Cycle <11, 9, 14, 7>
- Cycle <13, 3, 1, 5>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 5, 9, 4> has a chord (5, 9)
- <1, 5, 14, 9> has a chord (5, 9)
- <8, 1, 3, 7> has a chord (1, 7)
- <13, 3, 1, 5> has a chord (3, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 25 cycles found, and 24 of them have chords, so the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, 5, 9, 4>
