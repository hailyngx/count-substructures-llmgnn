- Cycle 26: <3, 4, 1, 8, 5>
- Cycle 27: <3, 4, 2, 8, 5>
- Cycle 28: <4, 1, 8, 5, 0>
- Cycle 29: <4, 1, 8, 2, 7>
- Cycle 30: <4, 1, 3, 5, 8>

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 5, 3, 1, 4>, Chord: (3, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 8, 5, 0, 6>, Chord: (5, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 8, 5, 7, 6>, Chord: (5, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, 4, 1, 8, 5>, Chord: (1, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [4].
