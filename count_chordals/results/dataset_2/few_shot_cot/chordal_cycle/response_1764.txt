Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 10, 13, 7, 4>
- <0, 10, 13, 8, 4>
- <1, 9, 10, 13, 7>
- <1, 9, 10, 13, 8>
- <2, 4, 7, 9, 6>
- <2, 4, 7, 13, 8>
- <3, 10, 13, 7, 4>
- <3, 10, 13, 8, 4>
- <4, 7, 13, 8, 5>
- <4, 6, 7, 13, 8>
- <6, 7, 9, 10, 13>
- <6, 1, 12, 5, 8>
- <7, 4, 3, 10, 13>
- <8, 13, 7, 4, 3>
- <9, 7, 4, 3, 10>
- <10, 13, 7, 4, 3>
- <12, 10, 13, 8, 5>
- <13, 7, 4, 3, 10>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 10, (13), 7, 4>
- <0, 10, (13), 8, 4>
- <1, 9, 10, (13), 7>
- <1, 9, 10, (13), 8>
- <2, 4, 7, (9), 6>
- <2, 4, 7, (13), 8>
- <3, 10, (13), 7, 4>
- <3, 10, (13), 8, 4>
- <4, 7, (13), 8, 5>
- <4, 6, 7, (13), 8>
- <6, 7, 9, 10, (13)>
- <6, 1, 12, 5, 8>
- <7, 4, 3, 10, (13)>
- <8, 13, 7, 4, 3>
- <9, 7, 4, 3, 10>
- <10, 13, 7, 4, 3>
- <12, 10, 13, 8, 5>
- <13, 7, 4, 3, 10>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found
- There are 18 chordless cycles found.
- Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [18].
