Response:
The number of chordless 4-cycles in the given graph is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, 0, 2, 14> (chord: (1, 2))
<3, 17, 9, 4> (chord: (9, 17))
<6, 18, 14, 2> (chord: (14, 6))
<6, 19, 8, 15> (chord: (8, 15))
<7, 16, 12, 3> (chord: (16, 3))
<7, 16, 12, 17> (chord: (12, 17))
<9, 15, 5, 6> (chord: (5, 6))
