Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 14, 5, 3>
<0, 14, 27, 20>
<1, 8, 13, 12>
<1, 10, 17, 4>
<2, 21, 7, 22>
<2, 21, 11, 27>
<2, 16, 24, 26>
<3, 5, 19, 7>
<4, 17, 10, 15>
<4, 27, 20, 11>
<5, 14, 27, 11>
<6, 9, 26, 24>
<7, 21, 11, 27>
<8, 13, 18, 24>
<11, 9, 26, 24>
<13, 8, 1, 10>
<14, 0, 27, 20>
<15, 6, 9, 26>
<16, 2, 3, 5>

<22, 7, 21, 11>
<24, 26, 16, 2>
<26, 24, 22, 7>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0, 14, 5, 3> - Chord: (14, 5)
<1, 8, 13, 12> - Chord: (8, 12)
<2, 21, 7, 22> - Chord: (21, 22)
<3, 5, 19, 7> - Chord: (5, 19)
<4, 17, 10, 15> - Chord: (17, 15)
<5, 14, 27, 11> - Chord: (14, 27)
<6, 9, 26, 24> - Chord: (9, 24)
<7, 21, 11, 27> - Chord: (21, 11)
<8, 13, 18, 24> - Chord: (13, 18)
<11, 9, 26, 24> - Chord: (9, 24)
<15, 6, 9, 26> - Chord: (6, 26)
<16, 2, 3, 5> - Chord: (2, 5)
<19, 7, 21, 11> - Chord: (7, 21)
<22, 7, 21, 11> - Chord: (7, 21)
<24, 26, 16, 2> - Chord: (26, 16)
<26, 24, 22, 7> - Chord: (24, 22)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
