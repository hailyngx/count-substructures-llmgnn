Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 9, 4, 7, 3, 2, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 1, 9, 4, 8, 7, 2, 5, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 1, 9, 4, 7, 3, 9, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 1, 9, 4, 8, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 1, 9, 4, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 6, 1, 9, 4, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 6, 1, 9, 3, 7, 2, 5, 0>
- Cycle 8: <0, 6, 8, 4, 7, 3, 2, 5, 0>
- Cycle 9: <0, 6, 8, 4, 7, 2, 5, 0>
- Cycle 10: <0, 6, 8, 4, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 11: <0, 6, 8, 7, 3, 9, 0>
- Cycle 12: <0, 6, 8, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle 13: <0, 6, 8, 7, 4, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 14: <0, 9, 4, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 15: <0, 9, 4, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle 16: <0, 9, 4, 7, 3, 2, 0>
- Cycle 17: <0, 9, 4, 7, 8, 6, 1, 2, 5, 0>
- Cycle 18: <0, 9, 1, 6, 8, 4, 7, 2, 5, 0>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle is:
<0, 6, 1, 9, 4, 7, 3, 2, 5, 0>
This 4-cycle has 4 non-adjacent chords: (1, 7), (3, 5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have:
[0]
