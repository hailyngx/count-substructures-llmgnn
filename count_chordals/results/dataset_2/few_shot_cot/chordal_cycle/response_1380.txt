Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 1, 9, 6, (13), 5, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 4, 8, (9), 6, 13, 5, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, 9, 8, (4), 10, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, 2, 9, 8, (14), 13, 6, 7, 0, 1, 12, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <4, 6, 13, 7, (14), 12, 9, 8, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <5, 1, 9, 8, (14), 13, 6, 7, 0, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <6, 4, 1, 9, 8, (14), 13, 7, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <7, 0, 1, 9, 8, (4), 11, 5, 13, 14, 12, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <10, 4, 8, 9, 1, 0, 7, 13, 14, 12, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <11, 3, 2, 9, 8, (4), 1, 0, 5, 13, 14, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <12, 6, 9, 8, (14), 13, 7, 0, 1, 4, 11, 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <13, 5, 1, 9, 8, (4), 11, 3, 12, 14, 7, 13>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <14, 7, 0, 1, 9, 8, (4), 11, 5, 13, 6, 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 7 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph. Therefore, the final count is [7].
