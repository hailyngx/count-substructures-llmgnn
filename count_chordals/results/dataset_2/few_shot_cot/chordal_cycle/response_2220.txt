Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 9, 4, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 7, 4, 9, 2)
- Cycle 4: (3, 2, 7, 4, 3)
- Cycle 5: (5, 9, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 6: (6, 5, 9, 4, 6)
- Cycle 7: (7, 4, 10, 11, 7)
- Cycle 8: (8, 6, 5, 12, 8)
- Cycle 9: (11, 10, 4, 7, 11)
- Cycle 10: (12, 5, 9, 0, 12)
- Cycle 11: (13, 0, 5, 14, 13)
- Cycle 12: (14, 5, 9, 4, 14)
- Cycle 13: (14, 11, 10, 7, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. 

- <0, 5, 9, 4, 0> has chord (5, 9)
- <1, 5, 9, 4, 1> has chord (5, 4)
- <2, 7, 4, 9, 2> has chord (7, 9)
- <3, 2, 7, 4, 3> has chord (2, 4)
- <5, 9, 4, 7, 5> has chord (9, 7)
- <6, 5, 9, 4, 6> has chord (5, 9)
- <7, 4, 10, 11, 7> has chord (4, 10)
- <8, 6, 5, 12, 8> has chord (6, 12)
- <11, 10, 4, 7, 11> has chord (10, 4)
- <12, 5, 9, 0, 12> has chord (5, 9)
- <13, 0, 5, 14, 13> has chord (0, 5)
- <14, 5, 9, 4, 14> has chord (5, 9)
- <14, 11, 10, 7, 14> has chord (11, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless cycles found. 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [13].
