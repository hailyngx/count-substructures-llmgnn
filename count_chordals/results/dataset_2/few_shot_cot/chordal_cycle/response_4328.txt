Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 2, 5, 8>
- Cycle <0, 2, 7, 10>
- Cycle <0, 10, 5, 11>
- Cycle <1, 6, 10, 9>
- Cycle <2, 5, 8, 14>
- Cycle <2, 7, 10, 5>
- Cycle <3, 6, 10, 9>
- Cycle <4, 12, 8, 14>
- Cycle <6, 10, 5, 11>
- Cycle <6, 12, 4, 13>
- Cycle <7, 2, 5, 11>
- Cycle <8, 12, 9, 1>
- Cycle <9, 12, 4, 13>
- Cycle <10, 6, 1, 9>
- Cycle <11, 5, 2, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 2, 5, 8> with chord (5, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 6, 10, 9> with chord (6, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, 12, 8, 14> with chord (8, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle <8, 12, 9, 1> with chord (9, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [11].
