Response:
In this graph, the chordal 4-cycles are as follows:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 13, 4, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 12, 9, 5, 8>
- Cycle 3: <0, 12, 6, 3, 14>
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 0, 7, 14>
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 12, 6, 4>
- Cycle 7: <1, 2, 4, 13, 11>
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 13, 6, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 5, 9, 1, 14>
- Cycle 10: <4, 5, 8, 3, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord {9, 7}
- Cycle 2 has chord {9, 5}
- Cycle 3 has chord {12, 6}
- Cycle 4 has chord {9, 5}
- Cycle 5 has chord {0, 14}
- Cycle 6 has chord {9, 4}
- Cycle 7 has no chord
- Cycle 8 has no chord
- Cycle 9 has chord {9, 1}
- Cycle 10 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 9, 13, 4, 7> (Chord: {9, 7})
<0, 12, 9, 5, 8> (Chord: {9, 5})
<0, 12, 6, 3, 14> (Chord: {12, 6})
<1, 9, 5, 8, 3> (Chord: {9, 5})
<1, 9, 0, 7, 14> (Chord: {0, 14})
<1, 9, 12, 6, 4> (Chord: {9, 4})
