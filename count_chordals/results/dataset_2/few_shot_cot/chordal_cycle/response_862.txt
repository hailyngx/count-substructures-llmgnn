Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 4) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle: <0, 5, 4, 7>
- Cycle: <0, 5, 3, 6>
- Cycle: <1, 9, 5, 4>
- Cycle: <1, 9, 3, 6>
- Cycle: <1, 4, 7, 2>
- Cycle: <1, 4, 2, 8>
- Cycle: <2, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle: <2, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle: <2, 7, 3, 6>
- Cycle: <3, 5, 9, 7>
- Cycle: <3, 5, 0, 4>
- Cycle: <4, 5, 9, 1>
- Cycle: <4, 7, 9, 1>
- Cycle: <5, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle: <5, 9, 1, 4>
- Cycle: <6, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle: <7, 9, 5, 3>
- Cycle: <8, 4, 0, 5>
- Cycle: <9, 5, 0, 4>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, 4, 7>, Chord: (4, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, 3, 6>, Chord: (5, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 9, 5, 4>, Chord: (5, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 9, 3, 6>, Chord: (3, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 4, 7, 2>, Chord: (4, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 4, 2, 8>, Chord: (4, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 4, 7, 3>, Chord: (4, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 4, 8, 6>, Chord: (4, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 7, 3, 6>, Chord: (7, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 18 chordal 4-cycles in total, so the number of chordless cycles is [0].
