Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <4, 9, 2, 3>
- Cycle 2: <4, 9, 14, 12>
- Cycle 3: <4, 9, 16, 1>
- Cycle 4: <4, 11, 18, 1>
- Cycle 5: <8, 17, 13, 6>
- Cycle 6: <7, 12, 14, 9>
- Cycle 7: <7, 15, 13, 6>
- Cycle 8: <7, 19, 13, 6>
- Cycle 9: <12, 14, 9, 16>
- Cycle 10: <13, 17, 1, 16>
- Cycle 11: <13, 19, 7, 15>
- Cycle 12: <14, 12, 7, 15>
- Cycle 13: <16, 1, 17, 8>
- Cycle 14: <16, 9, 2, 5>
- Cycle 15: <16, 10, 6, 13>
- Cycle 16: <16, 18, 11, 4>
- Cycle 17: <17, 8, 0, 10>
- Cycle 18: <17, 1, 18, 11>
- Cycle 19: <17, 13, 6, 10>
- Cycle 20: <18, 1, 16, 9>
- Cycle 21: <18, 10, 8, 17>
- Cycle 22: <19, 4, 11, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 2: <4, 9, 14, 12> has a unique chord (9, 14)
- Cycle 4: <4, 11, 18, 1> has a unique chord (11, 18)
- Cycle 6: <7, 12, 14, 9> has a unique chord (12, 9)
- Cycle 9: <12, 14, 9, 16> has a unique chord (14, 9)
- Cycle 16: <16, 18, 11, 4> has a unique chord (18, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 22 cycles found, and 5 of them have exactly one chord. So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [17].
