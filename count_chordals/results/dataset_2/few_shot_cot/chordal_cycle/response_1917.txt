Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 5) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 0, 7, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all existing edges are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-8-6-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-8-6-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-7-6-1-0
- Cycle 4: 0-7-6-8-0
- Cycle 5: 0-7-9-8-0
- Cycle 6: 1-6-7-0-1
- Cycle 7: 1-6-2-0-1
- Cycle 8: 1-6-2-9-1
- Cycle 9: 1-6-8-4-1
- Cycle 10: 2-6-8-4-2
- Cycle 11: 2-6-8-0-2
- Cycle 12: 2-6-1-0-2
- Cycle 13: 2-9-8-4-2
- Cycle 14: 3-6-1-0-3
- Cycle 15: 3-6-2-0-3
- Cycle 16: 4-1-6-8-4
- Cycle 17: 4-1-6-7-4
- Cycle 18: 4-8-6-1-4
- Cycle 19: 4-8-6-7-4
- Cycle 20: 5-0-7-6-5
- Cycle 21: 5-0-7-9-5

Step 2:
The cycles containing exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-2-0-1 (Chord: (6, 2))
- Cycle 2: 2-6-8-4-2 (Chord: (6, 8))
- Cycle 3: 3-6-2-0-3 (Chord: (6, 2))
- Cycle 4: 4-1-6-7-4 (Chord: (1, 7))

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, 6, (6, 2), 2>
<2, 6, (6, 8), 8>
<3, 6, (6, 2), 2>
<4, 1, (1, 7), 7>
