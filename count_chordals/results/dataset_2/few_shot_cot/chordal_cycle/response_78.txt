Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 3) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 2, 4>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 4, 7>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 9, 4>
- Cycle 5: <0, 2, 4, 7>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 7, 9>
- Cycle 7: <1, 9, 4, 7>
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 7, 9>
- Cycle 9: <3, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle 10: <3, 7, 9, 4>
- Cycle 11: <3, 8, 4, 7>
- Cycle 12: <3, 9, 4, 7>
- Cycle 13: <4, 7, 3, 9>
- Cycle 14: <4, 7, 9, 3>
- Cycle 15: <5, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle 16: <5, 4, 9, 7>
- Cycle 17: <5, 6, 7, 3>
- Cycle 18: <5, 6, 3, 7>
- Cycle 19: <6, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle 20: <6, 7, 9, 4>
- Cycle 21: <6, 7, 9, 3>
- Cycle 22: <6, 7, 3, 9>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <1, (4, 7), 9>
- Chordal Cycle 2: <2, (4, 7), 9>
- Chordal Cycle 3: <3, (4, 7), 9>
- Chordal Cycle 4: <5, (4, 7), 9>
- Chordal Cycle 5: <6, (4, 7), 9>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [17] chordless 4-cycles.
