Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- <0, 4, 1, 8>
- <0, 4, 1, 6>
- <0, 4, 1, 7>
- <0, 12, 2, 13>
- <0, 12, 2, 11>
- <0, 12, 11, 13>
- <1, 8, 5, 6>
- <1, 8, 5, 13>
- <1, 8, 10, 6>
- <1, 8, 10, 13>
- <1, 6, 5, 8>
- <1, 6, 5, 9>
- <1, 6, 11, 13>
- <1, 6, 11, 12>
- <1, 7, 3, 2>
- <1, 7, 3, 13>
- <1, 4, 5, 8>
- <1, 4, 5, 9>
- <1, 4, 13, 2>
- <1, 4, 13, 11>
- <2, 13, 8, 10>
- <2, 13, 8, 1>
- <2, 13, 11, 6>
- <2, 13, 11, 12>
- <2, 3, 7, 1>
- <2, 3, 7, 13>
- <3, 9, 5, 8>
- <3, 9, 12, 2>
- <3, 13, 11, 12>
- <4, 5, 9, 12>
- <4, 5, 13, 2>
- <4, 5, 13, 11>
- <4, 13, 11, 6>
- <4, 13, 11, 12>
- <6, 5, 9, 12>
- <6, 5, 13, 2>
- <6, 5, 13, 11>
- <6, 11, 13, 3>
- <6, 11, 13, 10>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordless 4-cycles found: <0, 4, 1, 8>, <0, 12, 2, 13>, <1, 8, 5, 6>, <1, 7, 3, 2>, <1, 4, 13, 2>, <2, 13, 8, 10>, <2, 13, 11, 6>, <2, 3, 7, 1>, <3, 9, 12, 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = 9
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
