Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 5) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 1) (2, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 2) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- <0, 5, 1, 8>
- <7, 5, 4, 2>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- For cycle <0, 5, 1, 8>, the chord is (0, 1).
- For cycle <7, 5, 4, 2>, the chord is (7, 4).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
