Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 0, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 9, 6, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 3: <3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 3>
- Cycle 4: <3, 4, 1, 8, 3>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 9, 1, 2, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 6, 8, 5, 0>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Checking Cycle 1: <0, 5, 7, 2, 0> has exactly one chord (5, 2).
- Checking Cycle 2: <1, 9, 6, 5, 8, 1> has no chord.
- Checking Cycle 3: <3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 3> has no chord.
- Checking Cycle 4: <3, 4, 1, 8, 3> has no chord.
- Checking Cycle 5: <0, 6, 9, 1, 2, 0> has exactly one chord (6, 1).
- Checking Cycle 6: <0, 6, 8, 5, 0> has exactly one chord (6, 8).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found: <0, 5, 7, 2, 0>, <0, 6, 9, 1, 2, 0>, and <0, 6, 8, 5, 0>.
- Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [3].
