Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 5, 1, 4, 8>
2. <0, 5, 9, 6, 0>
3. <0, 5, 9, 1, 8>
4. <0, 5, 2, 7, 8>
5. <0, 9, 1, 5, 2>
6. <0, 9, 1, 8, 4>
7. <0, 9, 8, 4, 1>
8. <0, 2, 7, 3, 0>
9. <0, 2, 8, 7, 3>
10. <1, 5, 2, 7, 8>
11. <1, 5, 9, 6, 0>
12. <1, 5, 9, 8, 4>
13. <1, 8, 9, 5, 2>
14. <2, 5, 9, 6, 0>
15. <3, 7, 2, 5, 9>
16. <3, 7, 8, 4, 1>
17. <4, 1, 5, 9, 6>
18. <4, 8, 7, 3, 0>
19. <7, 3, 2, 5, 9>
20. <8, 1, 5, 9, 6>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, (5, 2), 7, 3, 0>
2. <0, (5, 9), 1, 8, 4>
3. <0, 5, 9, (6, 0), 9>
4. <0, 9, (1, 8), 4, 1>
5. <1, 5, (2, 7), 8, 4>
6. <3, (7, 8), 4, 1, 3>
7. <4, 1, 5, (9, 6), 0>
8. <7, 3, (2, 5), 9, 6>
9. <8, 1, 5, (9, 6), 0>

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
