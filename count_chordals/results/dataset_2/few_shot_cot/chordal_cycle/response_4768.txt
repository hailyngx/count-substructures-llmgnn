Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 10) (11, 14) (11, 17) (16, 7) (16, 1) (16, 18) (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 18) (10, 11) (10, 15) (10, 7) (10, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 13) (2, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (15, 10) (15, 0) (15, 18) (15, 13) (13, 2) (13, 15) (17, 11) (17, 3) (17, 4) (4, 10) (4, 17) (12, 5) (7, 16) (7, 10) (7, 14) (14, 11) (14, 7) (14, 3) (18, 16) (18, 9) (18, 15) (18, 6) (19, 3) (0, 5) (0, 15) (0, 3) (0, 6) (3, 17) (3, 14) (3, 19) (3, 0) (1, 16) (1, 2) (1, 8) (6, 2) (6, 18) (6, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 15, 3, and node 6

Node 14 is connected to node 11, 7, and node 3
Node 15 is connected to node 10, 0, 18, and node 13
Node 16 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 18
Node 17 is connected to node 11, 3, and node 4
Node 18 is connected to node 16, 9, 15, and node 6
Node 19 is connected to node 3

Response:
There are 9 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. 

These chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, (5, 15), 3, 6)>
<1, (8, 16), 2, 13)>
<2, (6, 8), 1, 13)>
<3, (0, 14), 19, 17)>
<4, (10, 17), 7, 14)>
<5, (9, 12), 0, 5)>
<7, (10, 16), 14, 7)>
<10, (11, 15), 4, 7)>
<16, (1, 18), 8, 2)> 

Therefore, the final count of chordless cycles is [9].
