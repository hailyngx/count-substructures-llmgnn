Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

The cycles in the graph are as follows: 
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 13, 7>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 12, 7>
- Cycle 3: <5, 7, 12, 9>
- Cycle 4: <5, 7, 11, 4>
- Cycle 5: <9, 7, 12, 11>
- Cycle 6: <9, 7, 11, 4>
- Cycle 7: <9, 12, 7, 14>
- Cycle 8: <9, 12, 11, 4>
- Cycle 9: <13, 9, 12, 7>
- Cycle 10: <13, 9, 7, 11>
- Cycle 11: <13, 7, 11, 4>
- Cycle 12: <7, 12, 11, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. 

After checking all the cycles, we find one chordal 4-cycle:

<5, 9, 13, 7> with a chord (9, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 0 chordless cycle found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
