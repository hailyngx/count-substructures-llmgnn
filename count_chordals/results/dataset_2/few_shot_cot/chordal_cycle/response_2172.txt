Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 15, 8, 1> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 2: <0, 18, 1, 4> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 7, 2> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 4: <1, 8, 6, 7> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 5: <1, 18, 14, 17> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 6: <1, 8, 19, 14> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 7: <1, 18, 0, 19> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 7, 6> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 9: <2, 17, 14, 11> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 10: <2, 7, 6, 8> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 11: <5, 17, 14, 18> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 12: <8, 6, 7, 4> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 13: <8, 19, 9, 10> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 14: <8, 19, 0, 15> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 15: <8, 16, 3, 16> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 16: <14, 17, 13, 4> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 17: <14, 18, 1, 4> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 18: <14, 19, 0, 15> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 19: <14, 19, 8, 16> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 20: <16, 3, 16, 12> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 21: <17, 14, 19, 0> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 22: <19, 9, 10, 9> (Length: 4)
- Cycle 23: <19, 0, 15, 5> (Length: 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 18, 1, 4> has a chord: (18, 4)
- <1, 8, 6, 7> has a chord: (8, 7)
- <1, 8, 19, 14> has a chord: (8, 14)
- <2, 17, 14, 11> has a chord: (17, 11)
- <5, 17, 14, 18> has a chord: (17, 14)
- <8, 6, 7, 4> has a chord: (6, 4)
- <8, 16, 3, 16> has a chord: (8, 3)
- <14, 17, 13, 4> has a chord: (17, 4)
- <14, 18, 1, 4> has a chord: (18, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [15]
