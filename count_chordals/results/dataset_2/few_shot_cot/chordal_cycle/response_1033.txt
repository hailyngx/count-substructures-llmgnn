Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1:  
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph, and we need to check them for exactly one chord.

Cycles:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 3, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 2, 3, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 2, 3, 6, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 6, 8, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 9, 2, 3, 6, 8, 5>
- Cycle 6: <5, 9, 6, 8, 7, 4, 0, 5>
- Cycle 7: <5, 9, 6, 8, 7, 1, 0, 5>
- Cycle 8: <5, 8, 6, 9, 5>
- Cycle 9: <5, 8, 6, 3, 5>
- Cycle 10: <5, 8, 6, 3, 2, 9, 5>
- Cycle 11: <5, 8, 6, 3, 7, 4, 0, 5>
- Cycle 12: <5, 8, 6, 3, 7, 1, 0, 5>
- Cycle 13: <5, 1, 7, 4, 0, 5>
- Cycle 14: <5, 1, 7, 3, 6, 9, 5>
- Cycle 15: <5, 0, 8, 1, 7, 4, 3, 5>
- Cycle 16: <5, 0, 8, 1, 7, 3, 6, 9, 5>
- Cycle 17: <5, 0, 8, 6, 9, 2, 3, 5>
- Cycle 18: <5, 0, 4, 7, 1, 8, 5>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 2, 3, 5> - Chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 5: <5, 9, 2, 3, 6, 8, 5> - Chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 8: <5, 8, 6, 9, 5> - Chord: (8, 9)
- Cycle 9: <5, 8, 6, 3, 5> - Chord: (8, 3)
- Cycle 16: <5, 0, 8, 1, 7, 3, 6, 9, 5> - Chord: (0, 9)

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [5].
