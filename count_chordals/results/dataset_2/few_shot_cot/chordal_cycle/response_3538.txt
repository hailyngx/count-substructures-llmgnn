Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 9, 5, 2, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 9, 5, 2, 7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (3, 7, 4, 9, 5, 2, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 7, 4, 5, 9, 8, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 7, 4, 0, 9, 8, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 7, 4, 0, 2, 5, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 7, 4, 0, 2, 8, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 7, 0, 9, 5, 2, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 7, 0, 9, 8, 3, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 7, 0, 2, 5, 9, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 7, 3, 1, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 12: (5, 9, 8, 3, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 13: (5, 9, 8, 3, 2, 7, 5)
- Cycle 14: (6, 9, 8, 3, 7, 4, 6)
- Cycle 15: (6, 9, 8, 0, 4, 7, 6)
- Cycle 16: (7, 4, 9, 5, 2, 3, 7)
- Cycle 17: (7, 4, 0, 9, 8, 3, 7)
- Cycle 18: (7, 4, 0, 2, 5, 9, 7)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycle 1: <1, (5, 2), 7>
- Chordal cycle 2: <3, (4, 9), 8>
- Chordal cycle 3: <4, (0, 9), 7>
- Chordal cycle 4: <4, (2, 5), 9>
- Chordal cycle 5: <4, (0, 2), 7>
- Chordal cycle 6: <7, (4, 9), 0>
- Chordal cycle 7: <7, (2, 9), 4>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are a total of [12] chordless 4-cycles in the graph.
