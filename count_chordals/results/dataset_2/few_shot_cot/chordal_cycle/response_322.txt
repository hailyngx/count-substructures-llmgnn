Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (5, 1, 6, 7, 5)
- (9, 5, 1, 7, 9)
- (9, 3, 2, 8, 9)
- (9, 3, 6, 1, 9)
- (6, 1, 0, 7, 6)
- (6, 1, 7, 8, 6)
- (6, 3, 2, 8, 6)
- (6, 3, 8, 7, 6)
- (2, 8, 7, 0, 2)
- (2, 8, 0, 3, 2)
- (8, 6, 1, 7, 8)
- (8, 6, 3, 2, 8)
- (8, 0, 1, 7, 8)
- (8, 0, 7, 5, 8)
- (0, 9, 3, 2, 0)
- (0, 9, 5, 1, 0)
- (0, 2, 3, 8, 0)
- (0, 2, 4, 2, 0)
- (0, 7, 5, 1, 0)
- (7, 5, 9, 3, 7)
- (7, 5, 1, 6, 7)
- (7, 6, 1, 0, 7)
- (7, 6, 3, 8, 7)
- (3, 5, 9, 0, 3)
- (3, 5, 1, 6, 3)
- (3, 6, 1, 7, 3)
- (3, 6, 8, 2, 3)
- (4, 2, 8, 0, 4)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, (1, 7), 5>
- <9, (3, 6), 9>
- <9, (2, 8), 9>
- <6, (1, 7), 6>
- <6, (3, 2), 6>
- <2, (8, 0), 2>
- <8, (6, 1), 8>
- <8, (3, 2), 8>
- <0, (9, 3), 0>
- <7, (5, 1), 7>
- <7, (6, 1), 7>
- <3, (5, 9), 3>
- <3, (6, 1), 3>
- <4, (2, 8), 4>

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [14]
