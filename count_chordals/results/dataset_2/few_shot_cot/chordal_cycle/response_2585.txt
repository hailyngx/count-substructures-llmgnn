Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 2, 9>
- <0, 5, 7, 9>
- <0, 5, 4, 7>
- <0, 5, 2, 6>
- <1, 3, 7, 9>
- <1, 3, 7, 4>
- <1, 3, 8, 4>
- <2, 5, 9, 3>
- <2, 5, 7, 3>
- <2, 5, 4, 7>
- <2, 5, 4, 6>
- <2, 9, 3, 7>
- <3, 9, 5, 7>
- <4, 5, 7, 3>
- <4, 5, 0, 6>
- <4, 7, 3, 1>
- <4, 7, 3, 8>
- <4, 7, 6, 2>
- <5, 9, 3, 7>
- <6, 4, 7, 3>
  
Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 2, 9> has a chord (5, 9)
- <0, 5, 7, 9> has a chord (5, 9)
- <0, 5, 4, 7> has a chord (5, 7)
- <1, 3, 7, 9> has a chord (3, 7)
- <1, 3, 8, 4> has a chord (3, 8)
- <2, 5, 4, 6> has a chord (5, 6)
- <4, 5, 7, 3> has a chord (5, 3)
- <6, 4, 7, 3> has a chord (4, 7)
  
Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]
