Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more, there are no chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Step 3:
- Count the number of chordless cycles found which is 0.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
