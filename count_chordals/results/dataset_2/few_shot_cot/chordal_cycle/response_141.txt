Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 7, 4, 1, 14>
- <0, 7, 11, 13, 8>
- <0, 1, 4, 13, 11>
- <0, 12, 14, 1, 4>
- <1, 4, 13, 11, 7>
- <1, 14, 0, 7, 11>
- <2, 3, 5, 4, 14>
- <2, 9, 4, 13, 11>
- <2, 10, 8, 1, 4>
- <2, 5, 3, 12, 14>
- <3, 12, 0, 7, 11>
- <3, 5, 4, 13, 11>
- <5, 4, 13, 8, 6>
- <6, 8, 1, 4, 13>
- <11, 13, 4, 14, 10>
- <11, 7, 4, 14, 10>
- <11, 0, 12, 14, 10>
- <12, 0, 7, 4, 1>
- <12, 3, 5, 4, 13>
- <12, 14, 10, 8, 1>
- <13, 4, 14, 10, 8>
- <14, 1, 4, 13, 11>
- <14, 4, 9, 11, 7>
- <14, 9, 2, 3, 12>

Step 2: Checking for chord in each cycle:
- Chordless cycles are: 
<0, 7, 4, 1, 14>
<0, 12, 14, 1, 4>
<2, 9, 4, 13, 11>
<2, 10, 8, 1, 4>
<2, 5, 3, 12, 14>
<5, 4, 13, 8, 6>
<6, 8, 1, 4, 13>
<12, 3, 5, 4, 13>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: 
There are 8 chordless cycles in the given graph. So, the answer is [8].
