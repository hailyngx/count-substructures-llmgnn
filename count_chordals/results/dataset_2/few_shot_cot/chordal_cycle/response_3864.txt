Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 0, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 4, 3, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 2, 1, 4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 0, 3, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 5, 7, 0, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 2, 1, 5, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 3, 0, 9, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 5, 2, 9, 7)
- Cycle 9: (1, 5, 7, 0, 1)
- Cycle 10: (2, 5, 7, 0, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

<1, (2, 9), 5> (Chord: 2-9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 1 chordal 4-cycle present in the given graph, therefore the answer is [1].
