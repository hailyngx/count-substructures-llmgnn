Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 9, 4, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 9, 2, 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 9, 12, 14, 13, 8, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 2, 8, 13, 5, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 2, 10, 3, 8, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 13, 8, 3, 10, 2, 11, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 13, 14, 9, 12, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 6, 9, 12, 1, 13, 8, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 6, 9, 12, 14, 13, 8, 2>
- Cycle 10: <2, 8, 13, 11, 7, 5, 0, 6, 9, 2>
- Cycle 11: <3, 10, 13, 8, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has one chord, <9, 13>.
- Cycle 4 has one chord, <6, 13>.
- Cycle 5 has one chord, <6, 13>.
- Cycle 6 has no chords.
- Cycle 7 has no chords.
- Cycle 8 has no chords.
- Cycle 9 has no chords.
- Cycle 10 has no chords.
- Cycle 11 has no chords.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: 
There are 7 chordless cycles, so the final count is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <0, 6, 9, 12, 14, 13, 8, 0> with the chord (9, 13).
