Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:

Cycles:
1. <0, 4, 9, 5, 0>
2. <0, 4, 11, 2, 0>
3. <0, 13, 14, 2, 0>
4. <2, 7, 5, 13, 2>
5. <2, 7, 9, 5, 2>
6. <2, 11, 4, 9, 2>
7. <2, 11, 1, 6, 2>
8. <2, 13, 14, 10, 2>
9. <2, 13, 5, 3, 2>
10. <2, 11, 1, 6, 3, 10, 14, 13, 5, 7, 9, 4, 0, 2>
(Additional cycles may exist, but these are the unique ones)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 9, 5, 0> has a chord (4, 5)
- <0, 4, 11, 2, 0> does not have exactly one chord
- <0, 13, 14, 2, 0> has a chord (13, 14)
- <2, 7, 5, 13, 2> does not have exactly one chord
- <2, 7, 9, 5, 2> does not have exactly one chord
- <2, 11, 4, 9, 2> has a chord (4, 9)
- <2, 11, 1, 6, 2> does not have exactly one chord
- <2, 13, 14, 10, 2> does not have exactly one chord
- <2, 13, 5, 3, 2> does not have exactly one chord
- <2, 11, 1, 6, 3, 10, 14, 13, 5, 7, 9, 4, 0, 2> does not have exactly one chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [4]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are <0, 4, 9, 5> with chord (4, 5) and <0, 13, 14, 2> with chord (13, 14).
