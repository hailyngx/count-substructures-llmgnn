Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, such as:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 14, 8>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 13, 11>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 13, 12>
- Cycle 5: <0, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 4, 13, 12, 7>
- Cycle 7: <0, 4, 14, 12, 7>
- Cycle 8: <0, 4, 13, 12, 8>
- Cycle 9: <1, 4, 13, 11>
- Cycle 10: <1, 4, 13, 12>
- Cycle 11: <1, 4, 14, 12>
- Cycle 12: <1, 5, 10, 2>
- Cycle 13: <2, 14, 4, 1>
- Cycle 14: <2, 14, 12, 13>
- Cycle 15: <2, 14, 12, 8>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 1, 5> has a chord: (0, 1)
- <0, 4, 14, 8> has a chord: (4, 8)
- <0, 4, 13, 11> has a chord: (4, 11)
- <0, 4, 13, 12> has a chord: (4, 12)
- <0, 4, 13, 12, 7> has no chord
- <0, 4, 14, 12, 7> has a chord: (14, 12)
- <0, 4, 13, 12, 8> has no chord
- <1, 4, 13, 11> has a chord: (4, 11)
- <1, 4, 13, 12> has a chord: (4, 12)
- <1, 4, 14, 12> has a chord: (14, 12)
- <1, 5, 10, 2> has a chord: (5, 2)
- <2, 14, 4, 1> has a chord: (14, 1)
- <2, 14, 12, 13> has a chord: (14, 13)
- <2, 14, 12, 8> has a chord: (14, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 3 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
