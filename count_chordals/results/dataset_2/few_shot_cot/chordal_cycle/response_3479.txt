Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 1, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 8, 7, 5, 6, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 0>
- Cycle 4: <2, 6, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 3, 0, 2>

Step 2:
Checking for the cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 1, (3), 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, (1), 3, 4, 7, 8, 0>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <2, 6, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 3, 0, 2>
