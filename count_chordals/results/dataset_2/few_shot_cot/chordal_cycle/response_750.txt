Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <0, 5, 7, 4, 0>
        - <0, 5, 7, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 0>
        - <0, 5, 9, 2, 4, 0>
        - <1, 9, 2, 4, 7, 5, 3, 8, 1>
        - <2, 9, 1, 8, 3, 6, 1, 0, 5, 7, 4, 2>
        - <3, 5, 0, 1, 9, 2, 7, 4, 3>
        - <4, 5, 7, 9, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 4>
        - <5, 7, 9, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 0>
        - <6, 1, 9, 2, 4, 7, 5, 3, 6>
        - <7, 5, 3, 6, 1, 8, 2, 9, 0, 7>
        - <8, 1, 9, 2, 7, 4, 5, 3, 8>
        - <9, 5, 0, 1, 8, 3, 6, 1, 2, 4, 9>
        - <0, 5, 9, 1, 8, 3, 6, 1, 7, 4, 0>
        - ... (and more)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <0, 5, 7, 4, 0> (Chord: (5, 7))
        - <0, 5, 7, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 0> (Chord: (1, 3))
        - <0, 5, 9, 2, 4, 0> (Chord: (2, 9))
        - <1, 9, 2, 4, 7, 5, 3, 8, 1> (Chord: (4, 5))
        - <2, 9, 1, 8, 3, 6, 1, 0, 5, 7, 4, 2> (Chord: (1, 3))
        - <3, 5, 0, 1, 9, 2, 7, 4, 3> (Chord: (1, 7))
        - <4, 5, 7, 9, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 4> (Chord: (1, 3))
        - <5, 7, 9, 2, 8, 1, 6, 3, 0> (Chord: (1, 3))
        - <6, 1, 9, 2, 4, 7, 5, 3, 6> (Chord: (1, 3))
        - <7, 5, 3, 6, 1, 8, 2, 9, 0, 7> (Chord: (1, 3))
        - <8, 1, 9, 2, 7, 4, 5, 3, 8> (Chord: (1, 3))
        - <9, 5, 0, 1, 8, 3, 6, 1, 2, 4, 9> (Chord: (1, 3))
        - <0, 5, 9, 1, 8, 3, 6, 1, 7, 4, 0> (Chord: (1, 3))
        - ... (and more)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are [13] chordal 4-cycles found.
