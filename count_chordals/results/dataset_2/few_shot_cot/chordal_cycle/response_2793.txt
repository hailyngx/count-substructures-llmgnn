Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 13, 12, 7>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 14, 10, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 9, 2, 7>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 3, 12, 7>
- Cycle 6: <2, 9, 5, 1, 7>
- Cycle 7: <3, 9, 11, 0, 4>
- Cycle 8: <3, 10, 1, 7, 2>
- Cycle 9: <3, 11, 12, 13, 4>
- Cycle 10: <4, 6, 3, 12, 7>
- Cycle 11: <7, 2, 9, 3, 11>
  
Step 2: 
Out of the cycles listed above, the only chordal 4-cycle is <0,4,6,1> where the chord is (4,12).

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [10].
