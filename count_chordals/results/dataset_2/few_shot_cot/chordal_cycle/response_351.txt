Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Node 4, 8, 18, 7 forms a cycle.
- Node 7, 21, 17, 13 forms a cycle.
- Node 4, 22, 17, 13 forms a cycle.
- Node 10, 22, 17, 13 forms a cycle.
- Node 13, 12, 9, 2 forms a cycle.
- Node 13, 17, 0, 11 forms a cycle.
- Node 13, 12, 11, 27 forms a cycle.
- Node 13, 3, 12, 9 forms a cycle.
- Node 20, 0, 17, 22 forms a cycle.
- Node 20, 14, 24, 3 forms a cycle.
- Node 20, 14, 24, 15 forms a cycle.
- Node 20, 0, 11, 27 forms a cycle.
- Node 23, 1, 3, 12 forms a cycle.
- Node 23, 26, 6, 9 forms a cycle.
- Node 23, 26, 10, 22 forms a cycle.
- Node 24, 3, 12, 13 forms a cycle.
- Node 24, 14, 20, 0 forms a cycle.
- Node 24, 14, 20, 10 forms a cycle.
- Node 26, 6, 9, 2 forms a cycle.
- Node 26, 23, 15, 18 forms a cycle.
- Node 26, 23, 1, 3 forms a cycle.
- Node 27, 21, 17, 22 forms a cycle.
- Node 28, 3, 13, 17 forms a cycle.
- Node 28, 3, 12, 9 forms a cycle.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- The cycle formed by nodes 4, 22, 17, 13 has a chord between nodes 4 and 17.
- The cycle formed by nodes 10, 22, 17, 13 has a chord between nodes 10 and 17.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 23 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final answer is [23].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <4, 8, 18, 7>
- <7, 21, 17, 13>
- <13, 12, 9, 2>
- <13, 17, 0, 11>
- <13, 12, 11, 27>
- <20, 0, 17, 22>
- <20, 14, 24, 3>
- <20, 14, 24, 15>
- <20, 0, 11, 27>
- <23, 1, 3, 12>
- <23, 26, 6, 9>
- <23, 26, 10, 22>
- <24, 3, 12, 13>
- <24, 14, 20, 0>
- <24, 14, 20, 10>
- <26, 6, 9, 2>
- <26, 23, 15, 18>
- <26, 23, 1, 3>
- <27, 21, 17, 22>
- <1, 3, 12, 9>
- <13, 3, 12, 9>
- <28, 3, 13, 17>
- <28, 3, 12, 9>
