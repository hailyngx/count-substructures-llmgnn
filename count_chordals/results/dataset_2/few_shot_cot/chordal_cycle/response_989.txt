Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <3, 5, 15, 18>
- <3, 5, 15, 17>
- <3, 5, 13, 19>
- <3, 5, 13, 0>
- <3, 7, 15, 17>
- <3, 7, 15, 18>
- <3, 7, 12, 1>
- <3, 7, 12, 4>
- <3, 13, 5, 15>
- <3, 13, 5, 2>
- <3, 13, 19, 14>
- <3, 13, 19, 6>
- <3, 16, 1, 12>
- <3, 16, 1, 8>
- <3, 16, 11, 7>
- <5, 2, 4, 12>
- <5, 2, 4, 7>
- <5, 2, 4, 12>
- <5, 2, 3, 7>
- <5, 2, 3, 16>
- <5, 3, 7, 12>
- <5, 3, 7, 15>
- <5, 3, 13, 0>
- <5, 3, 13, 19>
- <5, 3, 13, 19>
- <5, 3, 16, 1>
- <5, 3, 16, 11>
- <5, 15, 17, 8>
- <5, 15, 17, 3>

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <5, 2, 4, 12, (2, 4)>
- <5, 3, 7, 15, (3, 15)>
- <7, 3, 16, 1, (3, 1)>
- <12, 4, 7, 3, (4, 3)>
  
Step 3: 
The number of chordless cycles found is [52].
