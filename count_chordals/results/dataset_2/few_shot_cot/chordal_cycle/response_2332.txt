Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 7, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 9, 6, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 4, 7, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 7, 5, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 9, 4, 6, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 9, 8, 5, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 4, 7, 5, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 4, 9, 1, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 8, 5, 7, 2)
- Cycle 10: (3, 1, 6, 4, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 1, 9, 6, 3)
- Cycle 12: (3, 7, 4, 9, 3)
- Cycle 13: (3, 7, 6, 1, 3)
- Cycle 14: (4, 6, 1, 9, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 6, 7, 3, 4)
- Cycle 16: (4, 7, 3, 9, 4)
- Cycle 17: (5, 0, 8, 9, 5)
- Cycle 18: (5, 0, 9, 4, 5)
- Cycle 19: (5, 7, 4, 6, 5)
- Cycle 20: (6, 1, 9, 0, 6)
- Cycle 21: (6, 4, 2, 7, 6)
- Cycle 22: (6, 4, 7, 3, 6)
- Cycle 23: (6, 7, 3, 1, 6)
- Cycle 24: (7, 3, 1, 6, 7)
- Cycle 25: (7, 4, 6, 1, 7)
- Cycle 26: (8, 2, 4, 9, 8)
- Cycle 27: (8, 2, 1, 9, 8)
- Cycle 28: (8, 5, 7, 0, 8)
- Cycle 29: (9, 0, 6, 4, 9)
- Cycle 30: (9, 0, 8, 5, 9)
- Cycle 31: (9, 1, 2, 4, 9)
- Cycle 32: (9, 3, 7, 4, 9)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (1, 6), 3> 
- <1, (1, 9), 6> 
- <1, (1, 6), 7>
- <1, (1, 9), 6>
- <2, (2, 4), 7> 
- <2, (2, 8), 5> 
- <4, (4, 6), 1> 
- <4, (4, 7), 3> 
- <5, (5, 7), 0> 
- <6, (6, 9), 0> 
- <8, (8, 2), 9> 
- <9, (9, 1), 3> 

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [12].
