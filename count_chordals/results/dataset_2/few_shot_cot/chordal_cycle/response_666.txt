Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 5, 1> with edges (0, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1), (1, 0)
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 8, 7> with edges (0, 4), (4, 8), (8, 7), (7, 0)
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 6, 2> with edges (0, 4), (4, 6), (6, 2), (2, 0)
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 6, 2> with edges (1, 5), (5, 6), (6, 2), (2, 1)
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 9, 8> with edges (1, 5), (5, 9), (9, 8), (8, 1)
- Cycle 6: <2, 5, 9, 8> with edges (2, 5), (5, 9), (9, 8), (8, 2)
- Cycle 7: <4, 5, 9, 8> with edges (4, 5), (5, 9), (9, 8), (8, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 4, 5, 1> has one chord: (4, 1)
- <1, 5, 6, 2> has one chord: (5, 2)
- <1, 5, 9, 8> has one chord: (5, 8)
- <2, 5, 9, 8> has one chord: (5, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [4].
