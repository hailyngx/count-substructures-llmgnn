- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 9, 4, 2> with chord (9, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 9, 4, 3> with chord (9, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 9, 4, 6> with chord (9, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 2, 7, 4> with chord (5, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 3, 7, 4> with chord (5, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle <9, 4, 6, 8> with chord (4, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle <9, 4, 2, 7> with chord (4, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle <9, 5, 0, 3> with chord (5, 0)
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, 8, 1, 9> with chord (8, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, 8, 6, 7> with chord (8, 6)
