Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <3, (6, 17), 14>. 

Following the steps provided earlier:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3-6-0-7-1-13-8
- Cycle 2: 3-6-0-7-16-8-13
- Cycle 3: 3-6-0-15-5-11-1
- Cycle 4: 3-6-0-15-5-4-14
- Cycle 5: 3-17-14-4-5-11-1
- Cycle 6: 3-17-14-4-9-12-13

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (6, 17).
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (5, 11).
- Cycle 6 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is 1. 

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
