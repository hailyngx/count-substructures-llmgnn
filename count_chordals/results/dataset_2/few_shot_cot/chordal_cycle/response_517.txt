Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <6, 9, 2, 8> with a chord (9, 8).
So, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
