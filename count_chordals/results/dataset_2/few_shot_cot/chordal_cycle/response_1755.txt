Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

1. <5, 3, 7, 1, 5>
2. <5, 3, 7, 2, 5>
3. <5, 8, 4, 7, 5>
4. <9, 3, 7, 1, 9>
5. <9, 3, 7, 2, 9>
6. <9, 0, 4, 7, 9>
7. <6, 9, 3, 7, 6>
8. <4, 7, 3, 1, 4>
9. <4, 7, 3, 9, 4>
10. <4, 7, 2, 5, 4>
11. <7, 3, 1, 4, 7>
12. <7, 3, 9, 4, 7>
13. <7, 2, 5, 4, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- The cycle <5, 3, 7, 1, 5> has a chord (3, 7) 
- The cycle <5, 3, 7, 2, 5> has a chord (3, 7)
- The cycle <5, 8, 4, 7, 5> has a chord (8, 4)
- The cycle <9, 3, 7, 1, 9> has a chord (3, 7)
- The cycle <9, 3, 7, 2, 9> has a chord (3, 7)
- The cycle <6, 9, 3, 7, 6> has a chord (9, 3)
- The cycle <4, 7, 3, 1, 4> has a chord (7, 3)
- The cycle <4, 7, 3, 9, 4> has a chord (7, 3)
- The cycle <4, 7, 2, 5, 4> has a chord (7, 5)
- The cycle <7, 3, 1, 4, 7> has a chord (3, 4)
- The cycle <7, 3, 9, 4, 7> has a chord (3, 4)
- The cycle <7, 2, 5, 4, 7> has a chord (2, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
