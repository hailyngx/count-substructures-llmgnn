Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 13) (4, 5) (4, 14) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 10) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 0) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 12) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 5) (0, 8) (14, 4) (14, 7) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 2) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 0) (2, 14) (2, 13) (12, 9) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 12) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 10) (13, 4) (13, 2) (10, 7) (10, 3) (10, 9) (10, 12) (10, 5)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle: <1, 6, 9, 1>

Cycles of length 5:
- Cycle: <1, 6, 9, 12, 11, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 6, 9, 10, 5, 1>
- Cycle: <6, 9, 10, 12, 11, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycle found:
- Cycle: <1, 6, 9, 1>, Chord: (1, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
