Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 7 - 4 - 0
- Cycle 2: 1 - 6 - 5 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 6 - 5 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 6 - 7 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 6 - 7 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 6 - 7 - 0 - 1
- Cycle 7: 1 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 8: 3 - 6 - 5 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 9: 3 - 6 - 7 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 10: 3 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 3
- Cycle 11: 3 - 1 - 4 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 12: 3 - 1 - 4 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 13: 3 - 1 - 4 - 9 - 3
- Cycle 14: 4 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 4
- Cycle 15: 4 - 9 - 8 - 6 - 4
- Cycle 16: 4 - 9 - 7 - 0 - 4
- Cycle 17: 4 - 9 - 7 - 5 - 4
- Cycle 18: 4 - 1 - 6 - 8 - 4
- Cycle 19: 7 - 5 - 6 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 20: 7 - 5 - 6 - 3 - 7
- Cycle 21: 7 - 5 - 0 - 3 - 7
- Cycle 22: 7 - 5 - 0 - 4 - 7
- Cycle 23: 7 - 5 - 2 - 5 - 7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 7 - 4 - 0 has a chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 2: 1 - 6 - 5 - 2 - 1 has a chord (6, 2)
- Cycle 3: 1 - 6 - 5 - 7 - 1 has a chord (6, 7)
- Cycle 4: 1 - 6 - 7 - 5 - 1 has a chord (6, 5)
- Cycle 5: 1 - 6 - 7 - 4 - 1 has a chord (6, 4)
- Cycle 6: 1 - 6 - 7 - 0 - 1 has a chord (6, 0)
- Cycle 7: 1 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 1 has a chord (6, 8)
- Other cycles do not have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, (5, 7), 4, 0>
- <1, (6, 2), 5, 1>
- <1, (6, 7), 5, 1>
- <1, (6, 5), 7, 1>
- <1, (6, 4), 7, 1>
- <1, (6, 0), 7, 1>
- <1, (6, 8), 7, 1>
