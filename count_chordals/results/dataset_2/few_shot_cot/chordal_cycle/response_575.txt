Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 13, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 13, 14, 9, 12, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 13, 12, 4, 5, 1>
- Cycle 4: <3, 12, 4, 5, 10, 14, 9, 7, 3>
- Cycle 5: <3, 7, 11, 6, 4, 12, 3>
- Cycle 6: <8, 13, 12, 4, 6, 11, 7, 8>
- Cycle 7: <9, 12, 3, 7, 11, 6, 9>
- Cycle 8: <10, 8, 7, 11, 13, 14, 10>
- Cycle 9: <1, 0, 12, 9, 2, 1>
- Cycle 10: <4, 5, 8, 7, 9, 12, 4>
- Cycle 11: <5, 8, 7, 3, 6, 4, 5>
- Cycle 12: <6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 9, 14, 10, 6>
- Cycle 13: <6, 0, 8, 7, 11, 13, 4, 6>
- Cycle 14: <8, 7, 3, 2, 9, 14, 13, 8>
- Cycle 15: <9, 14, 13, 8, 10, 5, 4, 12, 9>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <<1, 13>, (5, 4), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <<1, 12>, (13, 14), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <<4, 5>, (8, 7), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <<4, 12>, (6, 11), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <<4, 6>, (12, 9), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <<6, 4>, (12, 13), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <<7, 8>, (11, 13), 12>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <<9, 12>, (14, 13), 8>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]
