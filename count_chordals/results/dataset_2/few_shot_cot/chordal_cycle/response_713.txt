Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 0) (6, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- There are several cycles in the graph, such as (0, 1, 4, 5), (2, 4, 6, 8), (3, 6, 7, 0), etc.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- One of the cycles that satisfy this condition is the cycle (0, 1 , 4, 5) with a chord (1, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<0, 1, 4, 5>, (1, 5)
