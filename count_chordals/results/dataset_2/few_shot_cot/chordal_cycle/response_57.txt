Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle <0, 17, 3, 5> with edges (0, 17), (17, 3), (3, 5), (5, 19), (19, 0)
2. Cycle <0, 17, 6, 1> with edges (0, 17), (17, 6), (6, 1), (1, 0), (0, 8)
3. Cycle <0, 17, 19, 5> with edges (0, 17), (17, 19), (19, 5), (5, 13), (13, 0)
4. Cycle <1, 18, 15, 13> with edges (1, 18), (18, 15), (15, 13), (13, 1)
5. Cycle <2, 9, 12, 4> with edges (2, 9), (9, 12), (12, 4), (4, 2)
6. Cycle <2, 9, 12, 0> with edges (2, 9), (9, 12), (12, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2)
7. Cycle <3, 17, 6, 1> with edges (3, 17), (17, 6), (6, 1), (1, 3)
8. Cycle <4, 12, 0, 1> with edges (4, 12), (12, 0), (0, 1), (1, 4), (4, 2)
9. Cycle <5, 19, 17, 3> with edges (5, 19), (19, 17), (17, 3), (3, 5)
10. Cycle <6, 17, 0, 1> with edges (6, 17), (17, 0), (0, 1), (1, 6), (6, 8)
11. Cycle <8, 6, 17, 3> with edges (8, 6), (6, 17), (17, 3), (3, 8)
12. Cycle <8, 0, 1, 13> with edges (8, 0), (0, 1), (1, 13), (13, 8), (8, 1)
13. Cycle <12, 9, 2, 4> with edges (12, 9), (9, 2), (2, 4), (4, 12)

Step 2:
Among these cycles, only the following cycle has exactly one chord:
<0, 17, 6, 1> with chord (17, 1)

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [12].
