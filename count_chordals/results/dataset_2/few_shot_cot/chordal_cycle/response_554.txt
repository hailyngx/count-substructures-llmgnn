Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 2) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 4, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 9, 3, 4, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 9, 2, 7, 6, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 9, 5, 6, 7, 2>
- Cycle 6: <3, 9, 5, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle 7: <4, 9, 5, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 8: <5, 9, 2, 7, 6, 5>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (5, 9).
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (5, 9).
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (5, 9).
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (5, 9).
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (5, 9).
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (5, 9).
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (5, 9).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
