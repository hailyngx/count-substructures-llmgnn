Response:
Let's go through the steps to find the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- There are some 4-cycles in the graph as follows:
    - Cycle 1: <6, 10, 4, 8>
    - Cycle 2: <6, 11, 14, 5>
    - Cycle 3: <6, 11, 13, 5>
    - Cycle 4: <10, 6, 11, 13>
    - Cycle 5: <10, 4, 12, 9>
    - Cycle 6: <10, 12, 7, 0>
    - Cycle 7: <13, 11, 14, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Among the listed cycles, the cycle <6, 11, 14, 5> has exactly one chord: (6, 14) which is not an edge in the cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There is only 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <6, 11, 14, 5>
