Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:
1. <0, 5, 18, 16>
2. <0, 15, 10, 14>
3. <0, 15, 10, 3>
4. <0, 15, 5, 18>
5. <0, 6, 1, 11>
6. <0, 6, 1, 14>
7. <0, 19, 11, 17>
8. <1, 11, 16, 13>
9. <1, 11, 19, 13>
10. <1, 14, 10, 3>
11. <2, 3, 10, 14>
12. <9, 7, 4, 13>
13. <9, 7, 4, 12>
14. <9, 8, 3, 10>
15. <9, 19, 11, 17>
16. <11, 19, 2, 3>
17. <13, 19, 2, 3>
18. <16, 18, 5, 15>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <0, 5, 18, 16> has one chord: (5, 16) 
2. <0, 15, 10, 14> has one chord: (15, 10)
3. <0, 15, 10, 3> has one chord: (15, 10)
4. <0, 15, 5, 18> has one chord: (15, 18)
5. <0, 6, 1, 11> has one chord: (6, 11)
6. <0, 6, 1, 14> has one chord: (6, 14)
7. <0, 19, 11, 17> has one chord: (19, 11)
8. <1, 11, 16, 13> has one chord: (11, 16)
9. <1, 11, 19, 13> has one chord: (11, 13)
10. <1, 14, 10, 3> has one chord: (14, 10)
11. <2, 3, 10, 14> has one chord: (3, 14)
12. <9, 7, 4, 13> has one chord: (7, 13)
13. <9, 7, 4, 12> has one chord: (7, 4)
14. <9, 8, 3, 10> has one chord: (8, 10)
15. <9, 19, 11, 17> has one chord: (19, 11)
16. <11, 19, 2, 3> has one chord: (19, 3)
17. <13, 19, 2, 3> has one chord: (19, 2)
18. <16, 18, 5, 15> has one chord: (16, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found in this graph.

Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
