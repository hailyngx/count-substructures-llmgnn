Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 8) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 3, 9, 6>
- <0, 3, 1, 9>
- <1, 9, 7, 5>
- <1, 9, 6, 8>
- <1, 9, 3, 0>
- <1, 4, 2, 7>
- <1, 7, 5, 6>
- <1, 7, 0, 6>
- <1, 8, 6, 5>
- <2, 4, 1, 7>
- <2, 4, 9, 6>
- <2, 6, 8, 5>
- <2, 6, 9, 3>
- <5, 8, 1, 9>
- <5, 8, 6, 9>
- <5, 7, 0, 3>
- <5, 7, 9, 6>
  
Step 2:
The chordal cycles are:
- <0, 3, 1, 9> has a chord 1-9
- <1, 9, 7, 5> has a chord 5-7
- <1, 9, 6, 8> has a chord 6-8
- <1, 4, 2, 7> has a chord 2-7
- <1, 7, 5, 6> has a chord 5-6
- <1, 7, 0, 6> has a chord 0-6
- <5, 7, 9, 6> has a chord 7-9

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [10].
