Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in this graph are:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 3, 12, 5>
- <0, 3, 11, 12>
- <0, 3, 11, 1>
- <0, 3, 4, 10>
- <1, 6, 13, 8>
- <1, 6, 2, 5>
- <1, 6, 2, 14>
- <1, 6, 13, 12>
- <1, 11, 3, 4>
- <1, 11, 12, 5>
- <1, 11, 12, 13>
- <1, 11, 0, 7>
- <2, 5, 12, 3>
- <2, 5, 8, 13>
- <2, 5, 8, 4>
- <2, 5, 12, 13>
- <2, 10, 4, 3>
- <2, 10, 4, 8>
- <2, 10, 9, 14>
- <3, 11, 1, 6>
- <3, 11, 12, 13>
- <3, 12, 5, 2>
- <4, 3, 11, 1>
- <4, 3, 12, 13>
- <4, 8, 5, 2>
- <4, 8, 5, 12>
- <4, 10, 9, 14>
- <4, 10, 2, 5>
- <5, 12, 13, 6>
- <6, 13, 8, 5>
- <6, 13, 12, 14>
- <9, 14, 13, 8>
- <10, 9, 14, 13>
  
Step 2: Check for exactly one chord:
- <1, 6, 13, 8> has a chord: (1, 8)
- <1, 6, 13, 12> has a chord: (1, 12)
- <1, 11, 0, 7> has a chord: (11, 7)
- <2, 5, 8, 13> has a chord: (5, 13)
- <2, 5, 8, 4> has a chord: (5, 4)
- <4, 3, 11, 1> has a chord: (3, 1)
- <4, 3, 12, 13> has a chord: (3, 13)
- <4, 8, 5, 12> has a chord: (5, 12)
- <4, 10, 9, 14> has a chord: (9, 14)
- <6, 13, 8, 5> has a chord: (8, 5)
- <10, 9, 14, 13> has a chord: (9, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count would be [10].
