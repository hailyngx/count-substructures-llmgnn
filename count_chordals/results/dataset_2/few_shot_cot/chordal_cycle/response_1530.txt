Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- <5, 4, 0, 6> 
- <5, 4, 1, 6> 
- <5, 4, 7, 3> 
- <5, 4, 7, 2> 
- <5, 7, 2, 9> 
- <5, 7, 3, 6> 
- <5, 7, 4, 6> 
- <5, 9, 2, 7> 
- <5, 9, 7, 4> 
- <5, 0, 4, 6> 
- <1, 4, 7, 3> 
- <1, 4, 7, 2> 
- <1, 4, 5, 0> 
- <1, 0, 4, 6>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are: 
- <5, 4, 0, 6> with chord (5, 0) 
- <1, 4, 7, 3> with chord (1, 3) 
- <1, 4, 7, 2> with chord (1, 2) 

Step 3:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
