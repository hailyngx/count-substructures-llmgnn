Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 3, 1> with length 4
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 7, 4> with length 4
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 7, 4> with length 4
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 9, 4> with length 4
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 8, 5, 2> with length 5
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 4, 9> with length 4
- Cycle 7: <1, 7, 6, 3> with length 4
- Cycle 8: <1, 9, 4, 7> with length 4
- Cycle 9: <2, 4, 7, 6> with length 4
- Cycle 10: <2, 4, 9, 1> with length 4
- Cycle 11: <2, 4, 9, 7> with length 4
- Cycle 12: <2, 9, 1, 3> with length 4
- Cycle 13: <2, 9, 4, 7> with length 4

- Cycle 15: <3, 6, 1, 0> with length 4
- Cycle 16: <3, 1, 9, 4> with length 4
- Cycle 17: <4, 7, 6, 3> with length 4
- Cycle 18: <4, 9, 1, 7> with length 4
- Cycle 19: <5, 8, 7, 6> with length 4
- Cycle 20: <5, 8, 1, 9> with length 4

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <<1, 9, 4, 7>, (1, 7)> with chord 1-7

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [19]
