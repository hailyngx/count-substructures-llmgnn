Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <7, 25, 0, 25>
- Cycle 2: <9, 22, 18, 14>
- Cycle 3: <4, 1, 7, 25>
- Cycle 4: <5, 26, 9, 22>
- Cycle 5: <26, 14, 18, 22>
- Cycle 6: <23, 24, 20, 4>
- Cycle 7: <17, 11, 27, 22>
- Cycle 8: <15, 6, 23, 24>
- Cycle 9: <16, 2, 21, 24>
- Cycle 10: <8, 6, 23, 26>
- Cycle 11: <28, 20, 4, 1>
- Cycle 12: <29, 3, 7, 25>
- Cycle 13: <10, 19, 17, 5>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <9, 22, 18, 14> with chord (22, 14)
- <5, 26, 9, 22> with chord (26, 22)
- <23, 24, 20, 4> with chord (24, 20)
- <17, 11, 27, 22> with chord (11, 27)
- <8, 6, 23, 26> with chord (8, 23)
- <29, 3, 7, 25> with chord (3, 7)

Step 3:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
