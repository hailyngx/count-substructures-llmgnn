- Cycle 7: <0, 2, 4, 1>
- Cycle 8: <0, 12, 4, 13>
- Cycle 9: <0, 12, 11, 5>
- Cycle 10: <1, 4, 13, 9>
- Cycle 11: <1, 4, 12, 11>

- Cycle 25: <8, 9, 13, 4>
- Cycle 26: <9, 10, 2, 4>
- Cycle 27: <9, 10, 14, 5>
- Cycle 28: <10, 14, 5, 11>
- Cycle 29: <11, 7, 6, 8>
- Cycle 30: <12, 11, 7, 5>

Step 2: Identify the chordal 4-cycle found:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 4, 13, 9> (chord: (1, 9))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found = 30 - 1 = 29
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
