Response:
Let's follow the steps to find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- One of the 4-cycles in the graph is <0, 4, 16, 11>.
- Another 4-cycle is <0, 4, 6, 28>.
- One more 4-cycle is <1, 17, 21, 7>.
- One additional 4-cycle is <5, 9, 8, 26>.
- The last 4-cycle is <10, 18, 27, 13>.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The 4-cycle <0, 4, 6, 28> has one chord (edge 4-28).
- The 4-cycle <5, 9, 8, 26> has one chord (edge 9-26).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 4, 16, 11>, <1, 17, 21, 7>, <10, 18, 27, 13>.
