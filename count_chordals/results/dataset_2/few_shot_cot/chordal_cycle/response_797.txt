Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- There are no cycles to check for the presence of chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, there are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
