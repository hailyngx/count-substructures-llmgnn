Response:
Let's start by listing all cycles of length 4 in the graph:

1. <0, 8, 1, 5, 0>
2. <0, 8, 1, 6, 0>
3. <0, 8, 1, 0, 4>
4. <0, 1, 5, 7, 0>
5. <4, 0, 1, 5, 4>
6. <4, 0, 8, 1, 4>
7. <4, 13, 9, 12, 4>
8. <4, 13, 9, 8, 4>
9. <4, 13, 1, 5, 4>
10. <5, 1, 13, 4, 5>
11. <5, 1, 8, 0, 5>
12. <5, 1, 0, 4, 5>
13. <5, 1, 6, 7, 5>
14. <5, 1, 8, 12, 5>
15. <5, 1, 0, 8, 5>
16. <5, 7, 11, 13, 5>
17. <7, 6, 1, 5, 7>
18. <7, 6, 1, 0, 7>
19. <7, 6, 12, 14, 7>
20. <11, 13, 9, 12, 11>
21. <11, 13, 1, 5, 11>
22. <11, 13, 1, 0, 11>
23. <11, 13, 4, 0, 11>
24. <11, 14, 7, 5, 11>
25. <11, 14, 7, 2, 11>
26. <11, 14, 12, 8, 11>
27. <11, 14, 12, 9, 11>
28. <11, 14, 12, 5, 11>
29. <12, 8, 0, 4, 12>
30. <12, 8, 1, 5, 12>
31. <12, 9, 13, 4, 12>
32. <12, 9, 13, 11, 12>
33. <12, 9, 13, 1, 12>
34. <12, 9, 13, 10, 12>
35. <12, 14, 11, 7, 12>
36. <12, 14, 11, 5, 12>
37. <14, 11, 7, 5, 14>

Next, checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 8, 1, 5> with chord (8, 5)
<1, 5, 7, 6> with chord (5, 6)
<4, 13, 9, 12> with chord (13, 12)
<7, 6, 12, 14> with chord (6, 14)
<11, 13, 1, 5> with chord (13, 5)

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [32].
