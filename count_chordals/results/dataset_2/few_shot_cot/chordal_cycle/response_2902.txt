Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - Chord found in <3, 1, 14, 17>: (1, 14)
        - Chord found in <3, 1, 15, 12>: (1, 15)
        - Chord found in <15, 1, 14, 17>: (1, 14)
        - Chord found in <1, 14, 17, 11>: (14, 17)
        - Chord found in <14, 17, 11, 6>: (17, 11)
        - Chord found in <17, 11, 6, 5>: (11, 6)
        - Chord found in <5, 13, 10, 6>: (13, 10)
        - Chord found in <10, 6, 11, 12>: (6, 11)
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are 47 chordless cycles identified
        
Therefore, the final count is [47].
