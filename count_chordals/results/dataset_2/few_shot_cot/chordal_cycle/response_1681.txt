Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 6, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 11, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 9, 4, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 11, 2, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 5, 8, 7, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 1, 6, 9, 3>
- Cycle 8: <3, 1, 11, 12, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 7, 10, 12, 3>
- Cycle 10: <4, 9, 13, 10, 4>
- Cycle 11: <6, 9, 13, 10, 6>
- Cycle 12: <6, 11, 12, 10, 6>
- Cycle 13: <7, 5, 2, 8, 7>
- Cycle 14: <8, 5, 2, 11, 8>
- Cycle 15: <14, 6, 1, 3, 14>

Step 2: Checking for chords:
- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <1, 6>
- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <2, 11>
- Cycle 5 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <1, 6>
- Cycle 6 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <5, 8>
- Cycle 8 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <1, 12>
- Cycle 10 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <9, 13>
- Cycle 11 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <9, 13>
- Cycle 12 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <11, 12>
- Cycle 14 is a chordal 4-cycle with a chord <2, 11>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the count of chordless cycles is [7].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 1, 6, 4>, (1, 6)
<0, 1, 11, 2>, (2, 11)
<1, 6, 9, 4>, (1, 6)
<2, 5, 8, 7>, (5, 8)
<3, 1, 11, 12>, (1, 12)
<4, 9, 13, 10>, (9, 13)
<8, 5, 2, 11>, (2, 11)
