Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 7) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, and node 1

Node 2 is connected to node 0, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 

The cycles of length 4 in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: (3,5,9,6)
- Cycle 2: (3,5,8,4)
- Cycle 3: (3,9,6,0)
- Cycle 4: (3,9,4,8)
- Cycle 5: (3,5,9,1,7)
- Cycle 6: (3,9,1,0,6)
- Cycle 7: (3,9,1,7,8)
- Cycle 8: (5,9,6,0)
- Cycle 9: (5,9,4,8)
- Cycle 10: (5,8,4,9)
- Cycle 11: (9,6,0,2)
- Cycle 12: (9,1,0,2)
- Cycle 13: (9,1,7,8)
- Cycle 14: (6,0,2,7)
- Cycle 15: (4,8,1,7)

Step 2: 

Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are: 
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 5), 9, 6)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (3, 8), 5, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <7, (1, 9), 5, 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, (3, 8), 5, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <7, (1, 8), 3, 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <3, (5, 9), 6, 0)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, (4, 8), 9, 5)>

Step 3:

Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles found, we have [8].
