Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 1, 4, 13> with edges (0, 9), (9, 1), (1, 4), (4, 13), (13, 0)
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 1, 3, 6> with edges (0, 9), (9, 1), (1, 3), (3, 6), (6, 0)
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 2, 13, 4> with edges (0, 9), (9, 2), (2, 13), (13, 4), (4, 0)
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 2, 5, 11> with edges (0, 9), (9, 2), (2, 5), (5, 11), (11, 0)
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 10, 2, 13> with edges (0, 9), (9, 10), (10, 2), (2, 13), (13, 0)
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 2, 5, 6> with edges (1, 9), (9, 2), (2, 5), (5, 6), (6, 1)
- Cycle 7: <1, 9, 2, 13, 4> with edges (1, 9), (9, 2), (2, 13), (13, 4), (4, 1)
- Cycle 8: <1, 9, 10, 2, 5> with edges (1, 9), (9, 10), (10, 2), (2, 5), (5, 1)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 9, 1, 4, 13> has chord (1, 13)
- <0, 9, 1, 3, 6> has chord (1, 6)
- <0, 9, 2, 13, 4> has chord (2, 4)
- <0, 9, 2, 5, 11> has chord (2, 11)
- <0, 9, 10, 2, 13> has chord (10, 13)
- <1, 9, 2, 5, 6> has chord (2, 5)
- <1, 9, 2, 13, 4> has chord (9, 4)
- <1, 9, 10, 2, 5> has chord (9, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
