Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 3, 6, 5>
- <0, 3, 14, 12>
- <0, 10, 7, 6>
- <0, 11, 7, 10>
- <2, 4, 9, 13>
- <2, 7, 10, 12>
- <4, 8, 14, 12>
- <6, 7, 11, 9>

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 3, 6, 5, 2>
- <0, 3, 14, 12, 10>
- <0, 10, 7, 6, 11>
- <2, 4, 9, 13, 7>

Step 3: 
As we found 4 unique chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [4].
