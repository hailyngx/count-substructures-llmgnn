Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- <0, 4, 16, 2, 0>
- <0, 1, 19, 15, 8, 11, 3, 12, 19, 1>
- <0, 13, 9, 5, 16, 10, 19, 12, 3, 15, 17, 13>
- <3, 12, 19, 15, 8, 11, 18, 10, 16, 2, 6, 18>
- <5, 16, 4, 0, 13, 17, 15, 3, 11, 8, 18, 9>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 16, 2, 0> has chord (4, 2)
- <0, 1, 19, 15, 8, 11, 3, 12, 19, 1> has chord (15, 11)
- <0, 13, 9, 5, 16, 10, 19, 12, 3, 15, 17, 13> has chord (9, 5)
- <3, 12, 19, 15, 8, 11, 18, 10, 16, 2, 6, 18> has chord (15, 11)
- <5, 16, 4, 0, 13, 17, 15, 3, 11, 8, 18, 9> has chord (13, 17)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [5]
