Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 0, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 4, 7, 8, 0>
<0, 8, 7, 4, 0>
<0, 8, 3, 9, 5, 1, 0>
<0, 8, 3, 9, 4, 7, 0>
<0, 8, 3, 9, 4, 6, 0>
<0, 8, 3, 9, 4, 0>
<0, 8, 3, 4, 7, 0>
<0, 8, 3, 4, 6, 0>
<0, 8, 3, 4, 0>
<0, 8, 3, 0>
<0, 8, 1, 5, 9, 3, 0>
<0, 8, 1, 5, 9, 4, 7, 0>
<0, 8, 1, 5, 9, 4, 6, 0>
<0, 8, 1, 5, 9, 4, 0>
<0, 8, 1, 5, 9, 3, 4, 7, 0>
<0, 8, 1, 5, 9, 3, 4, 6, 0>
<0, 8, 1, 5, 9, 3, 4, 0>
<0, 8, 1, 5, 9, 3, 0>
...

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
<0, 8, 3, 9, 5, 1, 0> - Chord: (5, 1)
<0, 8, 1, 5, 9, 3, 0> - Chord: (1, 5)
<0, 8, 1, 5, 9, 3, 4, 7, 0> - Chord: (4, 7)
...

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
[3]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
