Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3)

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph. We will list all of them:
1. Cycle 1: 0-5-1-4-0
2. Cycle 2: 0-5-2-8-0
3. Cycle 3: 0-5-4-9-0
4. Cycle 4: 1-5-2-3-1
5. Cycle 5: 2-5-1-4-2
6. Cycle 6: 2-5-4-9-2
7. Cycle 7: 2-8-7-0-2
8. Cycle 8: 3-2-5-6-3
9. Cycle 9: 3-4-5-1-3
10. Cycle 10: 3-0-5-9-3
11. Cycle 11: 4-5-1-3-4
12. Cycle 12: 4-5-2-8-4
13. Cycle 13: 4-9-5-0-4
14. Cycle 14: 5-9-4-1-5
15. Cycle 15: 6-5-2-8-6
16. Cycle 16: 6-7-8-2-6
17. Cycle 17: 6-3-2-5-6
18. Cycle 18: 7-8-2-5-7
19. Cycle 19: 7-0-5-4-7
20. Cycle 20: 8-2-5-1-8
21. Cycle 21: 8-2-7-6-8
22. Cycle 22: 9-5-0-3-9
23. Cycle 23: 9-4-5-1-9

Step 2:
Now, we will check each cycle for exactly one chord, i.e., one non-adjacent edge connecting two vertices of the cycle.
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 4, 9, 5> with the chord (4, 0) inside parentheses.

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found in the graph.
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
