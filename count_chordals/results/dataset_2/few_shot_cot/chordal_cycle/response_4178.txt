Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (0, 16, 28, 15) with edges (0,16), (16,28), (28,15), and (15,0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 16, 25, 21) with edges (0,16), (16,25), (25,21), and (21,0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 21, 29, 12) with edges (0,21), (21,29), (29,12), and (12,0)
- Cycle 4: (1, 2, 24, 11) with edges (1,2), (2,24), (24,11), and (11,1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 10, 27, 10) with edges (1,10), (10,27), (27,10), and (10,1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 13, 23, 0) with edges (1,13), (13,23), (23,0), and (0,1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 24, 13, 28) with edges (2,24), (24,13), (13,28), and (28,2)
- Cycle 8: (3, 5, 17, 3) with edges (3,5), (5,17), (17,3), and (3,3)
- Cycle 9: (3, 6, 8, 20) with edges (3,6), (6,8), (8,20), and (20,3)
- Cycle 10: (4, 19, 14, 1) with edges (4,19), (19,14), (14,1), and (1,4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 24, 13, 28) with edges (4,24), (24,13), (13,28), and (28,4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

From the list, we can identify the following chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (2, 14), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (24, 13), 28>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 9 chordless cycles in the graph.

Final count: [9]
