- Cycle <13, 0, 11, 1>
- Cycle <14, 5, 9, 1>
- Cycle <14, 0, 11, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 13, 6, 7>, Chord: (13, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 9, 5, 8>, Chord: (9, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 14, 7, 6>, Chord: (14, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 5, 9, 10>, Chord: (5, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 8, 5, 14>, Chord: (8, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 13, 12, 7>, Chord: (13, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 9, 10, 12>, Chord: (9, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <8, 5, 9, 1>, Chord: (5, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 1, 14, 0>, Chord: (1, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 9 chordal 4-cycles present in the graph, so the count of chordless cycles is [45].
