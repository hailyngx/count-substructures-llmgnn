Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 7, 6, 3, 5>
- Cycle 2: <2, 1, 7, 4, 3, 2>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 4: <3, 5, 9, 6, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, (4, 7), 6, 3, 5>
- <2, 1, (7, 4), 3, 2>
- <0, 6, (7, 4), 0>
- <3, 5, (9, 6), 3>

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found = 0, so the final count is [0].
