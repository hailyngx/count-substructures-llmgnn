Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle: <1, 6, 28, 11, 1>
2. Cycle: <1, 6, 17, 22, 19, 26, 13, 27, 12, 8, 3, 10, 15, 17, 20, 29, 7, 28, 11, 1>
3. Cycle: <1, 25, 8, 12, 27, 13, 26, 19, 0, 3, 10, 15, 17, 28, 7, 29, 20, 17, 6, 1>
4. Cycle: <1, 25, 29, 7, 28, 6, 17, 22, 19, 0, 3, 8, 12, 27, 13, 26, 24, 23, 16, 29, 25, 1>
5. Cycle: <1, 4, 5, 7, 29, 25, 8, 12, 27, 13, 26, 24, 18, 5, 4>
6. Cycle: <1, 4, 11, 28, 7, 29, 16, 13, 27, 12, 8, 25, 1>
7. Cycle: <6, 17, 22, 19, 0, 3, 10, 15, 17>
8. Cycle: <6, 28, 7, 29, 16, 13, 27, 12, 8, 25, 1>

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle <1, 6, 28, 11, 1> has exactly one chord: (1, 11)
- The cycle <1, 4, 5, 7, 29, 25, 8, 12, 27, 13, 26, 24, 18, 5, 4> has exactly one chord: (5, 18)

Now, we count the number of chordless cycles found, which are:

- Chordless cycle: <1, 25, 29, 7, 28, 6, 17, 22, 19, 0, 3, 8, 12, 27, 13, 26, 24, 23, 16, 29, 25, 1>
- Chordless cycle: <1, 6, 17, 22, 19, 26, 13, 27, 12, 8, 3, 10, 15, 17, 20, 29, 7, 28, 11, 1>
- Chordless cycle: <1, 4, 11, 28, 7, 29, 16, 13, 27, 12, 8, 25, 1>
- Chordless cycle: <6, 17, 22, 19, 0, 3, 10, 15, 17>
- Chordless cycle: <6, 28, 7, 29, 16, 13, 27, 12, 8, 25, 1>

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [5].
