Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <0, 11, 4, 5> with the chord (0, 5).
To find the total number of chordless 4-cycles, we need to count the number of such cycles and put the final number inside brackets. Let's calculate this.

There are a total of 5 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph:
1. Cycle <0, 9, 5, 4>
2. Cycle <1, 3, 2, 5>
3. Cycle <1, 14, 6, 11>
4. Cycle <2, 3, 6, 13>
5. Cycle <4, 7, 8, 11>

Therefore, the total number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
