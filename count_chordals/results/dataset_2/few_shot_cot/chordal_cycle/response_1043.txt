63. <22, 16, 18, 11>
64. <22, 5, 10, 7>
65. <23, 1, 21, 18>
66. <23, 14, 7, 12>
67. <24, 13, 21, 1>

Step 2:
Out of the chordal 4-cycles listed above, the chordless cycles are:
1. <0, 21, 1, 29>
2. <0, 20, 26, 29>
3. <1, 29, 26, 3>
4. <5, 22, 16, 18>
5. <9, 20, 0, 22>
6. <13, 21, 1, 29>
7. <19, 8, 25, 0>
8. <20, 0, 21, 1>
9. <21, 1, 29, 26>
10. <29, 1, 23, 14>

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
