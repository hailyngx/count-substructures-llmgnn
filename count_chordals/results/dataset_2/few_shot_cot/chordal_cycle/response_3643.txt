Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 4, 8, 2, 5, 3, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 4, 3, 5, 2, 8, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 4, 5, 3, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 4, 8, 2, 5, 3, 0, 7, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 5, 3, 9, 7, 1>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord <1, 4>.
- Cycle 3 has one chord <1, 6>.
- Cycle 4 has one chord <4, 5>.
- Cycle 5 has one chord <4, 1>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [3].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 6, 1, 4, 3, 5, 9, 7, 0>
<0, 6, 4, 8, 2, 5, 3, 0>
<1, 6, 4, 5, 3, 9, 7, 1>
