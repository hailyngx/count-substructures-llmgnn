Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <5, 9, 6, 4>
2. <5, 9, 7, 6>
3. <5, 9, 7, 1>
4. <5, 9, 0, 1>
5. <5, 9, 0, 2>
6. <5, 0, 2, 4>
7. <5, 0, 2, 7>
8. <9, 6, 4, 8>
9. <9, 7, 2, 0>
10. <6, 7, 2, 0>
11. <7, 1, 4, 8>
12. <4, 1, 0, 2>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <5, 9, 6, 4> - Chord: (5, 6)
2. <5, 9, 7, 6> - Chord: (9, 7)
3. <5, 9, 7, 1> - Chord: (5, 1)
4. <5, 9, 0, 1> - Chord: (9, 0)
5. <5, 9, 0, 2> - Chord: (5, 2)
6. <5, 0, 2, 4> - Chord: (0, 4)
7. <5, 0, 2, 7> - Chord: (5, 7)
8. <9, 6, 4, 8> - Chord: (6, 8)
9. <9, 7, 2, 0> - Chord: (9, 2)
10. <6, 7, 2, 0> - Chord: (6, 2)
11. <7, 1, 4, 8> - Chord: (7, 4)
12. <4, 1, 0, 2> - Chord: (1, 0)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Since all the cycles in the graph have at least one chord, there are no chordless 4-cycles in this graph.
