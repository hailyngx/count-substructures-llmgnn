Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 9, 5, 2, 1>
<0, 9, 5, 3, 1>
<0, 9, 5, 8, 6>
<0, 1, 3, 5, 2>
<0, 1, 3, 2, 5>
<0, 1, 4, 9, 5>
<0, 1, 4, 9, 8>
<0, 1, 6, 3, 5>
<0, 1, 6, 3, 2>
<0, 1, 6, 8, 5>
<0, 3, 5, 2, 1>
<0, 3, 5, 9, 4>
<0, 3, 5, 9, 8>
<0, 3, 1, 4, 9>
<0, 3, 1, 6, 8>
<0, 3, 6, 1, 4>
<0, 4, 9, 5, 2>
<0, 4, 9, 8, 6>
<0, 6, 1, 3, 5>
<0, 6, 1, 4, 9>
<1, 3, 5, 9, 4>
<1, 3, 5, 9, 8>
<1, 3, 0, 9, 4>
<1, 3, 0, 9, 8>
<1, 4, 9, 5, 2>
<1, 4, 9, 8, 6>
<1, 6, 3, 5, 2>
<1, 6, 3, 2, 5>
<3, 5, 9, 4, 1>
<3, 5, 9, 8, 6>
<3, 1, 4, 9, 5>
<3, 1, 6, 8, 5>
<3, 2, 5, 9, 8>
<4, 9, 5, 2, 1>
<4, 9, 5, 8, 6>
<8, 5, 9, 4, 1>
<8, 5, 9, 4, 0>
<8, 6, 1, 4, 9>
<8, 6, 1, 3, 5>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
<0, 9, 5, 2, 1> (Chord: (5, 2))
<0, 3, 5, 2, 1> (Chord: (3, 2))
<0, 1, 4, 9, 5> (Chord: (1, 9))
<0, 1, 6, 3, 5> (Chord: (1, 3))
<1, 3, 5, 9, 4> (Chord: (3, 9))
<3, 1, 4, 9, 5> (Chord: (1, 9))
<4, 9, 5, 2, 1> (Chord: (4, 5))
<8, 5, 9, 4, 1> (Chord: (5, 4))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
[7]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
