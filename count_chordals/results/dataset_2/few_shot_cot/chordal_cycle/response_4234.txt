Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- <0, 5, 9, 1, 10>
- <0, 5, 9, 8, 13>
- <0, 5, 7, 11, 2>
- <0, 5, 10, 13, 3>
- <0, 6, 7, 11, 2>
- <0, 6, 5, 9, 1>
- <0, 6, 5, 10, 13>
- <0, 6, 7, 5, 9>
- <0, 12, 3, 4, 5>
- <1, 9, 7, 11, 2>
- <1, 9, 5, 6, 0>
- <1, 10, 5, 7, 11>
- <1, 10, 13, 8, 9>
- <2, 11, 7, 5, 10>
- <2, 11, 14, 1, 3>
- <2, 11, 6, 5, 0>
- <2, 14, 12, 0, 5>
- <3, 1, 9, 8, 13>
- <3, 1, 10, 13, 8>
- <3, 12, 0, 5, 6>
- <3, 12, 14, 11, 7>
- <4, 3, 13, 8, 9>
- <5, 9, 8, 6, 0>
- <5, 7, 11, 6, 0>
- <5, 10, 13, 8, 9>
- <6, 5, 9, 1, 10>
- <6, 7, 11, 2, 14>
- <6, 8, 13, 10, 5>
- <7, 5, 9, 8, 13>
- <10, 5, 9, 8, 13>
  
Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, 6, 7, 11, 2> (chord: 6-7)
- <0, 5, 9, 1, 10> (chord: 5-9)
- <0, 5, 10, 13, 3> (chord: 5-13)
- <1, 10, 5, 7, 11> (chord: 5-7)
- <2, 11, 7, 5, 10> (chord: 7-10)
- <3, 1, 10, 13, 8> (chord: 1-13)

Step 3:
There are [6] unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
