Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the given graph, but not all of them form chordal cycles. Let's list out the cycles where every edge in the cycle exists:

<0, 13, 17, 10, 5>
<0, 13, 17, 2, 18>
<0, 13, 17, 7, 16>
<0, 13, 17, 7, 9>
<0, 11, 5, 2, 18>
<0, 11, 14, 12, 18>
<0, 19, 4, 3, 1>
<0, 19, 4, 2, 18>
<0, 19, 14, 12, 18>
<1, 3, 4, 19, 0>
<1, 11, 14, 12, 18>
<2, 4, 3, 1, 11>
<2, 4, 19, 0, 13>
<2, 5, 8, 15, 14>
<2, 5, 11, 9, 16>
<2, 17, 13, 0, 19>
<2, 17, 10, 5, 11>
<2, 18, 16, 7, 9>
<2, 18, 16, 7, 17>
<2, 18, 12, 14, 15>
<3, 1, 11, 14, 12>
<4, 3, 1, 11, 5>
<4, 19, 0, 13, 17>
<4, 19, 14, 12, 18>
<5, 10, 17, 13, 0>
<5, 10, 17, 2, 18>
<5, 11, 14, 12, 18>
<6, 7, 17, 10, 5>
<7, 17, 13, 0, 11>
<7, 16, 18, 12, 14>
<8, 5, 2, 4, 19>
<8, 5, 11, 1, 3>
<8, 15, 14, 12, 18>
<9, 7, 17, 13, 0>
<9, 11, 14, 12, 18>
<10, 5, 11, 1, 3>
<10, 17, 13, 0, 11>
<11, 1, 3, 4, 19>
<11, 5, 8, 15, 14>
<13, 17, 2, 4, 19>
<14, 15, 8, 5, 11>
<16, 18, 12, 14, 19>

Step 2: 
Next, we check each cycle for exactly one chord. This step requires careful observation to identify the chords.

Step 3: 
After analyzing all the cycles listed above, we find that there are [4] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:
<0, 13, 17, 7>
<0, 11, 14, 12>
<2, 5, 11, 9>
<4, 19, 14, 12>
