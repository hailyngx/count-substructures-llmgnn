Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 5, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 3

Response:
Step 1:  
There are a total of 4-cycles in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 8, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 5, 6, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 3, 8, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 6, 5, 2, 8>
- Cycle 6: <3, 1, 5, 4, 3>

Step 2:  
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord
- Cycle 2 has no chord
- Cycle 3 has a chord: <1, (5, 6), 3>
- Cycle 4 has a chord: <1, (3, 8), 5>
- Cycle 5 has a chord: <2, (6, 5), 8>
- Cycle 6 has no chord

Step 3:  
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (5, 6), 3>
- <1, (3, 8), 5>
- <2, (6, 5), 8>
