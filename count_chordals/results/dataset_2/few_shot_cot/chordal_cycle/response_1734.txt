Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 7, 2, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 6, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 7, 2, 5>
- Cycle 4: <1, 4, 3, 8, 0>
- Cycle 5: <3, 9, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 6: <6, 9, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 7: <5, 6, 9, 3, 8>

Step 2:
Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord on edge (7, 2)
- Cycle 2 has a chord on edge (6, 5)
- Cycle 5 has a chord on edge (9, 4)
- Cycle 6 has a chord on edge (7, 4)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Chordal 4-cycles: 
<0, 9, 6, 5, 8, 3>
<1, 4, 7, 2, 5>
<3, 9, 6, 7, 4>
<5, 6, 9, 3, 8>
