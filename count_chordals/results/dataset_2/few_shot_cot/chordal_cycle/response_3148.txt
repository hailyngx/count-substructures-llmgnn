Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (0, 14, 10, 1)
- Cycle 2: (0, 14, 4, 8)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 12, 10)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 13, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 11, 1, 6)
- Cycle 6: (3, 12, 10, 14)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 13, 2)
- Cycle 8: (5, 0, 14, 7)
- Cycle 9: (6, 9, 11, 1)
- Cycle 10: (7, 8, 13, 3)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (0, 14, 10, 1) has a chord (10, 14)
- Cycle 2: (0, 14, 4, 8) has a chord (4, 14)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 12, 10) has a chord (5, 10)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 13, 2) has a chord (6, 13)
- Cycle 5: (7, 8, 13, 3) has a chord (8, 13)
- Cycle 6: (7, 8, 13, 3) has a chord (8, 13)

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 14, 10, 1>
<0, 5, 12, 10>
<1, 6, 13, 2>
<4, 8, 13, 2>
<7, 8, 13, 3>
