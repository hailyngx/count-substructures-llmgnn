Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 10, 14, 1, 18, 5, 2, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 9, 16, 17, 18, 5, 6, 13, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 13, 6, 15, 10, 7, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 13, 7, 10, 8, 2, 4)
- Cycle 5: (7, 10, 15, 19, 11, 19, 9, 4, 7)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has the chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 2 has the chord (9, 17)
- Cycle 3 has the chord (6, 15)
- Cycle 4 has the chord (8, 10)
- Cycle 5 has the chord (19, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we have found:
[5]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (1, 5)>
<2, (9, 17)>
<3, (6, 15)>
<4, (8, 10)>
<5, (19, 9)>
