Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 11, 16, 5> with edges (0, 11), (11, 16), (16, 5), (5, 0)
- Cycle <0, 11, 8, 9> with edges (0, 11), (11, 8), (8, 9), (9, 0)
- Cycle <0, 11, 8, 13> with edges (0, 11), (11, 8), (8, 13), (13, 0)
- Cycle <0, 11, 8, 17> with edges (0, 11), (11, 8), (8, 17), (17, 0)
- Cycle <0, 11, 1, 17> with edges (0, 11), (11, 1), (1, 17), (17, 0)

- ... (more cycles)

Step 2: Checking for chord in each cycle:
- <0, 11, 8, 9> has a chord (8, 9)
- <0, 11, 8, 13> has a chord (8, 13)
- <0, 11, 8, 17> has a chord (8, 17)
- <0, 23, 6, 4> has a chord (6, 4)
- <0, 23, 6, 18> has a chord (6, 18)
- <1, 11, 16, 14> has a chord (11, 14)
- <1, 11, 16, 5> has a chord (11, 5)
- <2, 28, 10, 18> has a chord (28, 10)
- <3, 20, 21, 26> has a chord (20, 26)
- <3, 20, 14, 21> has a chord (20, 14)
- <4, 6, 23, 12> has a chord (6, 12)
- <5, 16, 11, 1> has a chord (16, 1) 
- ... (more cycles)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are [12] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
