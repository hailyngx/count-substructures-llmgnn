Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 15, 10, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 16, 12, 17, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 16, 12, 18, 8, 11, 0, 3, 13, 19, 14, 17, 6, 15, 10, 1, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 1, 12, 17, 14, 6, 10, 15, 9, 5>
- Cycle 5: <9, 5, 1, 12, 18, 8, 11, 2, 17, 14, 6, 15, 10, 16, 5>
- Cycle 6: <9, 15, 14, 17, 12, 16, 10, 6, 17, 2, 4, 2, 11, 18, 12, 1, 10, 19, 13, 3, 0, 11, 8, 18, 12, 17, 6>
- Cycle 7: <14, 17, 2, 11, 8, 18, 12, 16, 5, 10, 15, 6, 14>
- Cycle 8: <14, 17, 2, 4, 19, 13, 3, 0, 11, 8, 18, 12, 1, 5, 10, 6, 15, 9, 14>
- Cycle 9: <14, 17, 2, 11, 8, 18, 12, 1, 10, 15, 6, 17, 14>

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Only Cycle 3 has a chord between nodes 10 and 15.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
We found 8 chordless cycles, thus the answer is [8].
