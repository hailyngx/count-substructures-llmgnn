Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle <0, 16, 4, 15>
2. Cycle <0, 16, 28, 5>
3. Cycle <0, 16, 28, 17, 10>
4. Cycle <0, 16, 28, 17, 19>
5. Cycle <0, 9, 20, 26>
6. Cycle <0, 9, 20, 22>
7. Cycle <0, 9, 20, 14>
8. Cycle <0, 9, 20, 22, 27>
9. Cycle <0, 9, 20, 22, 6>
10. Cycle <1, 10, 17, 28>
11. Cycle <1, 10, 17, 28, 5>
12. Cycle <1, 10, 17, 19>
13. Cycle <1, 10, 26, 24>
14. Cycle <2, 7, 21, 15>
15. Cycle <2, 7, 21, 15, 18>
16. Cycle <2, 7, 21, 15, 4>
17. Cycle <2, 7, 25, 6>
18. Cycle <2, 23, 8, 14>
19. Cycle <2, 13, 26, 24>
20. Cycle <3, 14, 8, 23>
21. Cycle <3, 14, 8, 2>
22. Cycle <4, 16, 28, 17>
23. Cycle <4, 16, 28, 5, 18>
24. Cycle <5, 28, 17, 10>
25. Cycle <5, 28, 17, 19>
26. Cycle <5, 28, 29, 24>
27. Cycle <6, 25, 19, 10>
28. Cycle <9, 20, 26, 24>
29. Cycle <10, 17, 19, 25>
30. Cycle <11, 29, 24, 26>
31. Cycle <13, 26, 24, 29>
32. Cycle <14, 1, 10, 17>
33. Cycle <14, 1, 10, 26>
34. Cycle <14, 8, 23, 2>
35. Cycle <16, 28, 17, 10>
36. Cycle <16, 28, 17, 19>
37. Cycle <18, 15, 21, 7>
38. Cycle <20, 9, 0, 16>
39. Cycle <20, 9, 0, 16, 28>
40. Cycle <20, 9, 16, 28, 17>
41. Cycle <22, 27, 20, 26>
42. Cycle <25, 7, 21, 15>

Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. Cycle <0, 16, 28, 17, 10> - Chord: (16, 17)
2. Cycle <0, 16, 28, 17, 19> - Chord: (16, 19)
3. Cycle <1, 10, 17, 28> - Chord: (10, 28)
4. Cycle <4, 16, 28, 17> - Chord: (16, 17)
5. Cycle <14, 1, 10, 17> - Chord: (1, 10)
6. Cycle <14, 8, 23, 2> - Chord: (8, 2)
7. Cycle <18, 15, 21, 7> - Chord: (15, 7)

Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have found 35 unique chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the final answer is [35].
