Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 14) (11, 5) (11, 8) (16, 8) (16, 14) (16, 10) (4, 9) (4, 13) (7, 18) (7, 5) (10, 16) (10, 17) (17, 10) (17, 6) (17, 12) (17, 9) (1, 13) (1, 18) (15, 19) (15, 0) (5, 11) (5, 7) (5, 19) (5, 18) (19, 15) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 6) (19, 0) (8, 11) (8, 16) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 12) (9, 4) (9, 17) (9, 8) (9, 14) (18, 7) (18, 1) (18, 5) (18, 19) (12, 17) (12, 8) (14, 11) (14, 16) (14, 8) (14, 9) (0, 15) (0, 19) (0, 3) (0, 13) (3, 0) (6, 17) (6, 19) (6, 13) (13, 4) (13, 1) (13, 0) (13, 6)
