Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- <0, 14, 1, 4, 13>
- <0, 14, 7, 9, 12>
- <1, 3, 11, 10, 14>
- <1, 4, 5, 2, 11>
- <3, 11, 2, 5, 12>
- <3, 7, 14, 13, 0>
- <5, 0, 6, 10, 14>
- <5, 2, 11, 10, 6>
- <5, 4, 13, 14, 7>
- <5, 7, 14, 10, 6>
- <7, 3, 11, 10, 14>
- <7, 5, 2, 11, 3>
- <7, 9, 12, 11, 3>
- <9, 10, 6, 0, 13>
- <9, 11, 3, 1, 4>
- <10, 6, 0, 13, 4>
- <10, 11, 3, 1, 14>
- <11, 3, 7, 5, 2>
- <11, 9, 12, 5, 0>
- <12, 11, 3, 1, 4>
- <13, 3, 7, 9, 12>
- <13, 0, 6, 10, 14>

Step 2: Checking for chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycles found: <1, (3, 11), 10> <5, (2, 11), 12> <7, (3, 11), 14> <9, (3, 11), 1>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [15]
