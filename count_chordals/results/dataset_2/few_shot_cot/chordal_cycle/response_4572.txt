Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
- From the given graph, we identify the following cycles of length 4 or more: 
   1. <0, 5, 9, 4, 0>
   2. <0, 5, 8, 2, 0>
   3. <0, 5, 6, 4, 0>
   4. <0, 7, 2, 1, 6, 3, 0>
   5. <0, 7, 6, 4, 3, 0>
   6. <1, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1>
   7. <2, 9, 4, 6, 5, 8, 2>
   8. <3, 4, 6, 1, 2, 3>

Step 2: 
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find that the following cycle has exactly one chord:
   - <0, 5, 8, 2, 0> with chord (5, 2)

Step 3: 
- Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have a total of 7 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
