Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. <5, 2, 9, 5>
2. <5, 9, 7, 0, 5>
3. <5, 1, 4, 5>
4. <5, 6, 1, 5>
5. <9, 2, 5, 9>
6. <9, 1, 5, 9>
7. <9, 7, 0, 9>
8. <9, 8, 7, 9>
9. <4, 1, 5, 4>
10. <4, 3, 1, 4>
11. <7, 0, 9, 7>
12. <7, 8, 9, 7>
13. <1, 5, 9, 1>
14. <3, 4, 1, 3>
15. <6, 1, 5, 6>
16. <6, 3, 4, 6>
17. <2, 5, 9, 2>
18. <8, 9, 7, 8>
19. <0, 9, 5, 0>
20. <0, 4, 1, 0>
21. <0, 7, 9, 0>
22. <0, 8, 9, 0>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (4-cycles) are:
- <5, 2, 9, 5> with chord (2, 9)
- <5, 1, 4, 5> with chord (1, 4)
- <9, 1, 5, 9> with chord (1, 5)
- <1, 5, 9, 1> with chord (5, 9)
- <4, 1, 5, 4> with chord (1, 5)
- <4, 3, 1, 4> with chord (3, 1)
- <7, 0, 9, 7> with chord (0, 9)
- <3, 4, 1, 3> with chord (4, 1)
- <2, 5, 9, 2> with chord (5, 9)
- <8, 9, 7, 8> with chord (9, 7)

Step 3:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
