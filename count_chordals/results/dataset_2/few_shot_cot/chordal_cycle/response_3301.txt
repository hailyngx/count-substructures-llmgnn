Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
<0, 12, 2, 7> 
<0, 12, 5, 1> 
<0, 17, 18, 11> 
<0, 17, 18, 8> 
<2, 7, 6, 13> 
<3, 1, 7, 4> 
<3, 1, 10, 9> 
<3, 10, 13, 4> 
<5, 1, 7, 4> 
<5, 12, 2, 7> 
<8, 11, 3, 1> 
<8, 11, 18, 17> 
<8, 11, 18, 12> 
<9, 19, 4, 13> 
<9, 19, 4, 7> 
<9, 19, 15, 12> 
<9, 16, 10, 1> 

Step 2:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is: 
<3, (1, 10), 9> 

Step 3:
- The number of chordless cycles found is [15].
