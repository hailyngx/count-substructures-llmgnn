Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 9, 4, 6, 0>
2. <0, 6, 2, 3, 0>
3. <0, 6, 4, 9, 0>
4. <1, 6, 4, 9, 1>
5. <1, 6, 7, 8, 1>
6. <2, 6, 4, 8, 2>
7. <2, 6, 7, 8, 2>
8. <3, 0, 6, 1, 3>
9. <3, 0, 4, 8, 3>
10. <4, 9, 6, 2, 4>
11. <7, 1, 6, 2, 7>
12. <8, 1, 7, 6, 8>

Step 2:
Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 <0, 9, 4, 6, 0> has chord (9, 4)
- Cycle 2 <0, 6, 2, 3, 0> has chord (6, 2)
- Cycle 3 <0, 6, 4, 9, 0> has chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 4 <1, 6, 4, 9, 1> has chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 5 <1, 6, 7, 8, 1> has chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 6 <2, 6, 4, 8, 2> has chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 7 <2, 6, 7, 8, 2> has chord (6, 7)
- Cycle 8 <3, 0, 6, 1, 3> has chord (0, 6)
- Cycle 9 <3, 0, 4, 8, 3> has chord (0, 4)
- Cycle 10 <4, 9, 6, 2, 4> has chord (9, 2)
- Cycle 11 <7, 1, 6, 2, 7> has chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 12 <8, 1, 7, 6, 8> has chord (1, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordless 4-cycles in this graph.
