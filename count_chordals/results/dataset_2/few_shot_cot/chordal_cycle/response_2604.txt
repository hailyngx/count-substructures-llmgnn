Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 0) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- List of cycles of length 4: 
  - <0, 9, 6, 2, 0>
  - <0, 9, 6, 4, 3, 0>
  - <0, 3, 4, 6, 9, 0>
  - <0, 3, 2, 6, 8, 0>
  - <0, 5, 3, 8, 6, 0>
  - <0, 5, 8, 2, 6, 0>
  - <0, 1, 8, 6, 9, 0>
  - <1, 8, 6, 9, 7, 6, 2, 3, 0, 1>
  - <2, 6, 4, 3, 5, 8, 2>
- List of cycles of length 5:
  - <0, 9, 6, 4, 2, 0>
  - <0, 3, 4, 6, 2, 0>
  - <0, 5, 3, 4, 6, 0>
  - <0, 1, 8, 6, 2, 0>
  
Step 2: 
- Checking for chords in the cycles listed above:
  - Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, 6, 2, 0>, Chord: (9, 2)
  - Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, 8, 2, 6, 0>, Chord: (5, 6)
  - Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 1, 8, 6, 9, 0>, Chord: (1, 9)
  
Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 9, 6, 2, 0>, and the total number of chordless cycles found is [1].
