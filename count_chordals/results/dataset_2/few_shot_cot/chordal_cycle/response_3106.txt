Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
1. <0, 5, 6, 1, 0>
2. <0, 5, 11, 13, 12, 0>
3. <0, 5, 11, 13, 6, 0>
4. <0, 5, 6, 7, 1, 0>
5. <0, 16, 3, 8, 14, 1, 0>
6. <0, 16, 3, 12, 17, 14, 1, 0>
7. <1, 6, 7, 18, 7, 1>
8. <3, 8, 14, 1, 15, 4, 16, 0>
9. <4, 0, 5, 11, 19, 8, 14, 16, 4>
10. <5, 0, 10, 9, 11, 19, 8, 14, 16, 4, 15>
11. <6, 1, 15, 12, 17, 14, 8, 19, 4, 0>
12. <6, 5, 11, 19, 4, 15, 12, 17, 14, 1>
13. <7, 6, 12, 17, 14, 8, 19, 4, 15, 1>
14. <12, 17, 14, 8, 19, 11, 13, 6, 1, 15>
15. <12, 15, 4, 19, 11, 13, 6, 7, 18, 7>
16. <16, 14, 8, 19, 11, 13, 6, 7, 18, 7, 1, 0>
17. <17, 14, 8, 19, 11, 13, 6, 7, 18, 7, 1, 15, 12>
18. <19, 11, 13, 6, 7, 18, 7, 1, 15, 4, 16>
19. <19, 8, 14, 17, 12, 15, 4, 16, 3, 0>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are: 
1. <0, 5, 6, (1, 7), 0>
2. <8, 14, 1, (15, 4), 16, 0>
3. <12, 17, (14, 8), 19, 4, 0>
4. <12, 15, (4, 19), 11, 13, 6>
5. <6, 1, 15, (12, 17), 14, 8>
6. <12, 17, (14, 8), 19, 11, 13, 6>
7. <16, 14, 8, 19, 11, 13, 6, (7, 18), 7, 1, 0>

Step 3: 
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7]. 
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are: 
1. <0, 5, 6, (1, 7), 0>
2. <8, 14, 1, (15, 4), 16, 0>
3. <12, 17, (14, 8), 19, 4, 0>
4. <12, 15, (4, 19), 11, 13, 6>
5. <6, 1, 15, (12, 17), 14, 8>
6. <12, 17, (14, 8), 19, 11, 13, 6>
7. <16, 14, 8, 19, 11, 13, 6, (7, 18), 7, 1, 0>
