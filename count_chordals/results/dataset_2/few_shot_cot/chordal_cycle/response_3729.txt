Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 0
