- In cycle <3, 23, 19, 14, 5, 18, 12>, chord (19, 18) exists.
- In cycle <4, 7, 0, 22, 25, 29, 21>, chord (25, 21) exists.
- In cycle <8, 21, 26, 17, 4, 7, 0>, chord (17, 0) exists.
- In cycle <8, 21, 26, 12, 10, 12, 18>, chord (26, 18) exists.
- In cycle <8, 21, 29, 19, 11, 24, 22>, chord (21, 24) exists.
