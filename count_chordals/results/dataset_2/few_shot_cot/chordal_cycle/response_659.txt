Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 7) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 1, 4, 7>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 6, 3, 2>
- Cycle 3: <5, 6, 3, 2, 7>
- Cycle 4: <9, 6, 3, 2, 1>
- Cycle 5: <9, 1, 4, 7, 0>
- Cycle 6: <6, 7, 4, 1, 8>
- Cycle 7: <3, 6, 4, 1, 8>
  
Step 2:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle that has exactly one chord is <5, 9, 1, 4> with the chord (9, 1).

Step 3:
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
