Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. <0, 4, 6, 3>
2. <0, 4, 7, 5>
3. <0, 4, 8, 13>
4. <0, 9, 3, 6>
5. <1, 7, 4, 6>
6. <1, 7, 5, 12>
7. <1, 7, 14, 9>
8. <1, 10, 11, 13>
9. <1, 10, 11, 5>
10. <1, 12, 6, 4>
11. <1, 12, 5, 7>
12. <1, 14, 7, 4>
13. <2, 11, 5, 7>
14. <2, 11, 13, 8>
15. <2, 11, 13, 5>
16. <2, 8, 4, 6>
17. <2, 8, 13, 11>
18. <2, 8, 13, 5>
19. <2, 13, 3, 6>
20. <3, 6, 4, 8>
21. <3, 6, 12, 5>
22. <3, 9, 14, 7>
23. <3, 11, 10, 1>
24. <3, 11, 13, 5>
25. <3, 13, 8, 4>
26. <3, 13, 12, 5>
27. <4, 6, 12, 5>
28. <4, 7, 14, 9>
29. <4, 8, 13, 11>
30. <4, 8, 13, 5>
31. <5, 7, 14, 9>
32. <6, 4, 8, 13>
33. <6, 12, 13, 5>
34. <7, 4, 8, 13>
35. <9, 0, 4, 8>
36. <9, 3, 6, 12>
37. <11, 10, 1, 7>
38. <11, 13, 8, 2>
39. <12, 6, 4, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

1. <0, 4, 6, 3> (Chord: 4, 6)
2. <1, 7, 14, 9> (Chord: 7, 9)
3. <1, 10, 11, 13> (Chord: 10, 11)
4. <2, 11, 13, 8> (Chord: 11, 13)
5. <3, 6, 12, 5> (Chord: 6, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 36 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [36].
