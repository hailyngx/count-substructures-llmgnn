Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all edges existing:
- <0, 5, 3, 1>
- <0, 5, 4, 2>
- <0, 5, 8, 6>
- <0, 5, 8, 7>
- <0, 9, 1, 3>
- <0, 9, 1, 2>
- <0, 9, 2, 4>
- <0, 9, 2, 6>
- <0, 2, 4, 5>
- <1, 9, 0, 7>
- <1, 9, 5, 8>
- <1, 3, 5, 8>
- <1, 3, 5, 4>
- <1, 3, 5, 0>
- <1, 2, 4, 5>
- <2, 9, 5, 4>
- <2, 9, 5, 0>
- <2, 9, 1, 3>
- <2, 4, 5, 8>
- <2, 4, 8, 6>
- <2, 4, 8, 7>
- <2, 6, 8, 7>
- <2, 6, 8, 5>
- <5, 8, 6, 7>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordless cycle: <0, 5, 3, 1>
- Chordless cycle: <0, 5, 4, 2>
- Chordless cycle: <0, 5, 8, 6>
- Chordless cycle: <0, 5, 8, 7>
- Chordless cycle: <0, 9, 1, 3>
- Chordless cycle: <0, 2, 4, 5>
- Chordless cycle: <1, 9, 0, 7>
- Chordless cycle: <1, 3, 5, 8>
- Chordless cycle: <1, 3, 5, 4>
- Chordless cycle: <1, 2, 4, 5>
- Chordless cycle: <2, 9, 5, 4>
- Chordless cycle: <2, 9, 1, 3>
- Chordless cycle: <2, 6, 8, 7>
- Chordless cycle: <5, 8, 6, 7>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [14].
