Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (5, 2, 16, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 17, 10, 0, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 0, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 11, 2, 5, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 11, 4, 11, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 13, 14, 1, 9)
- Cycle 7: (4, 11, 15, 18, 4)
- Cycle 8: (7, 9, 11, 15, 7)
- Cycle 9: (10, 17, 3, 8, 10)
- Cycle 10: (10, 0, 16, 19, 10)
- Cycle 11: (10, 8, 3, 17, 10)
- Cycle 12: (10, 1, 14, 18, 10)
- Cycle 13: (17, 5, 2, 11, 17)
- Cycle 14: (17, 10, 8, 3, 17)
- Cycle 15: (17, 3, 13, 14, 17)
- Cycle 16: (0, 5, 2, 16, 0)
- Cycle 17: (0, 10, 8, 6, 0)
- Cycle 18: (0, 16, 19, 1, 0)
- Cycle 19: (0, 6, 12, 6, 0)
- Cycle 20: (16, 0, 5, 2, 16)
- Cycle 21: (16, 2, 11, 15, 16)
- Cycle 22: (16, 19, 1, 6, 16)
- Cycle 23: (1, 10, 8, 6, 1)
- Cycle 24: (1, 6, 12, 6, 1)
- Cycle 25: (1, 14, 18, 15, 1)
- Cycle 26: (6, 0, 16, 19, 6)
- Cycle 27: (6, 1, 14, 13, 6)
- Cycle 28: (6, 12, 6, 8, 6)
- Cycle 29: (18, 14, 13, 15, 18)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (6, 12), 6>
- <6, (1, 14), 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [27] chordless cycles.
