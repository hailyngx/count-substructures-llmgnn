Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 8, 2, 9>
Cycle 2: <0, 6, 4, 3, 2, 9>
Cycle 3: <0, 6, 4, 3, 5, 7>
Cycle 4: <1, 6, 4, 3, 2, 9>
Cycle 5: <1, 6, 0, 7, 5, 8>
Cycle 6: <2, 9, 7, 5, 3, 8>
Cycle 7: <3, 6, 4, 0, 7, 5>
Cycle 8: <3, 6, 9, 7, 5, 8>
Cycle 9: <4, 6, 0, 7, 5, 8>
Cycle 10: <4, 6, 1, 8, 5, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal Cycle 1: <0, 6, (1, 8), 2, 9>
Chordal Cycle 2: <0, 6, (4, 3), 2, 9>
Chordal Cycle 3: <0, 6, (4, 3), 5, 7>
Chordal Cycle 4: <1, 6, (4, 3), 2, 9>
Chordal Cycle 5: <1, 6, (0, 7), 5, 8>
Chordal Cycle 6: <2, 9, (7, 5), 3, 8>
Chordal Cycle 7: <3, 6, (4, 0), 7, 5>
Chordal Cycle 8: <3, 6, (9, 7), 5, 8>
Chordal Cycle 9: <4, 6, (0, 7), 5, 8>
Chordal Cycle 10: <4, 6, (1, 8), 5, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 0 chordless cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
