Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
1. <1, 11, 2, 5> (Chord: (1, 2))
2. <1, 11, 8, 7> (Chord: (1, 8))
3. <2, 5, 10, 11> (Chord: (2, 10))
4. <3, 9, 13, 12> (Chord: (3, 12))
5. <4, 3, 9, 5> (Chord: (3, 4))
6. <5, 9, 13, 2> (Chord: (5, 13))
7. <7, 1, 11, 8> (Chord: (1, 8))
8. <9, 5, 10, 6> (Chord: (5, 10))
9. <10, 5, 2, 11> (Chord: (5, 2))
10. <11, 2, 5, 10> (Chord: (2, 10))
11. <12, 13, 9, 5> (Chord: (13, 5))
12. <14, 9, 13, 12> (Chord: (9, 13))
