Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, (5, 6), 4, 0>
- <0, (5, 6), 1, 2, 0>
- <0, (5, 6), 3, 9, 8, 0>
- <0, 5, (6, 1), 2, 0>
- <0, 5, (6, 3), 9, 8, 0>
- <0, 5, 6, (1, 7), 9, 8, 0>
- <0, 5, 6, 3, (9, 7), 0>
- <1, 4, (7, 9), 3, 6, 1>
- <1, 4, 7, (9, 8), 2, 1>
- <1, (4, 7), 0, 5, 6, 1>
- <1, 7, (0, 5), 6, 3, 1>
- <2, 9, (3, 4), 0, 2>
- <2, 9, 3, (4, 0), 5, 2>
- <3, 9, 8, 0, (5, 6), 3>
- <4, 7, 0, (5, 6), 3, 4>
