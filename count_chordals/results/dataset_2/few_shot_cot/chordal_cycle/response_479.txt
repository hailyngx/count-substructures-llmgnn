Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 7, 4>
- <0, 5, 7, 4, 11>
- <0, 8, 1, 2>
- <0, 8, 1, 2, 18>
- <0, 8, 1, 14, 16>
- <0, 8, 1, 14, 12>
- <0, 8, 1, 2, 18, 19>
- <0, 8, 1, 14, 16, 19>
- <1, 8, 6, 10>
- <1, 8, 6, 10, 14>
- <1, 8, 6, 10, 14, 16>
- <1, 8, 6, 10, 14, 12>
- <1, 8, 6, 10, 14, 16, 19>
- <1, 8, 6, 10, 14, 12, 17>
- <1, 8, 0, 2>
- <1, 8, 0, 5>
- <1, 8, 0, 2, 18>
- <1, 8, 0, 5, 7>
- <1, 8, 0, 2, 18, 19>
- <1, 8, 0, 5, 7, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 8, 0, 2> has one chord (1, 2)
- <0, 8, 1, 14, 16> has one chord (14, 16)
- <0, 8, 1, 14, 12> has one chord (1, 12)
- <0, 8, 1, 2, 18, 19> has one chord (1, 19)
- <0, 8, 1, 14, 12, 17> has one chord (1, 17)
- <1, 8, 0, 2, 18, 19> has one chord (0, 18)
- <1, 8, 0, 5, 7, 4> has one chord (0, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 5 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
