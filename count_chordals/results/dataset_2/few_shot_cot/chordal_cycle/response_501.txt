Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <4, 8, 5, 12>
- <4, 8, 6, 13>
- <4, 17, 12, 7>
- <4, 14, 3, 7>
- <4, 18, 9, 13>
- <4, 18, 13, 1>
- <8, 5, 3, 14>
- <8, 6, 13, 18>
- <2, 18, 4, 14>
- <2, 18, 13, 6>
- <2, 11, 0, 14>
- <0, 14, 16, 1>
- <0, 11, 9, 18>
- <14, 16, 5, 12>
- <7, 3, 14, 16>
- <7, 12, 17, 4>
- <12, 5, 8, 4>
- <12, 17, 4, 18>
- <12, 15, 16, 14>
- <1, 13, 18, 4>
- <17, 4, 18, 13>
- <10, 3, 14, 16>
- <10, 5, 8, 4>
- <15, 12, 17, 4>
- <5, 16, 14, 3>
- <6, 13, 18, 4>
- <6, 19, 6, 8>
- <9, 18, 2, 6>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <2, 18, 4, 14> (Chord: (2, 4))
- <8, 5, 3, 14> (Chord: (5, 3))
- <7, 12, 17, 4> (Chord: (7, 17))
- <1, 13, 18, 4> (Chord: (1, 18))

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [24].
