Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 3, 15, 2>
2. <0, 3, 1, 6>
3. <0, 3, 1, 19>
4. <0, 15, 2, 8>
5. <11, 16, 5, 13>
6. <11, 16, 0, 3>
7. <11, 16, 0, 15>
8. <11, 16, 5, 13>
9. <14, 3, 1, 6>
10. <14, 3, 1, 19>
11. <14, 3, 15, 2>
12. <14, 19, 1, 6>
13. <14, 19, 1, 3>
14. <15, 3, 1, 6>
15. <15, 3, 1, 19>
16. <17, 12, 7, 10>
17. <17, 12, 11, 16>
18. <17, 6, 1, 19>
19. <17, 6, 1, 3>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 3, 15, 2> (Chord: (2, 8))
2. <0, 3, 1, 6> (Chord: (1, 19))
3. <11, 16, 5, 13> (Chord: (5, 13))
4. <14, 3, 1, 6> (Chord: (1, 19))
5. <17, 12, 7, 10> (Chord: (7, 10))
6. <17, 6, 1, 19> (Chord: (1, 3))

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [6]
