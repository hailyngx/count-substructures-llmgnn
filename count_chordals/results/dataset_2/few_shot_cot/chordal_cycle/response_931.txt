Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists. 

- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 3, 2, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 8, 0, 4, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 8, 1, 6, 5>
- Cycle 5: <9, 4, 7, 6, 9>
- Cycle 6: <2, 7, 4, 6, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 9, 4, 0, 3>
- Cycle 8: <1, 2, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 6, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 10: <0, 8, 5, 1, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 6, 5> has chord (4, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 8, 0, 4, 5> has chord (0, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 8, 1, 6, 5> has chord (1, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, 4, 7, 6, 9> has chord (7, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, 9, 4, 0, 3> has chord (4, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [5].
