Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <7, (8, 13), 1>. 

Following the steps mentioned earlier:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-8-13-5-9-1
- Cycle 2: 1-9-4-13-8-1
- Cycle 3: 1-9-5-13-8-1
- Cycle 4: 1-8-12-2-6-1
- Cycle 5: 1-10-6-2-12-1
- Cycle 6: 2-12-8-13-2
- Cycle 7: 2-12-11-14-6-2
- Cycle 8: 2-6-3-4-13-2
- Cycle 9: 2-6-10-7-11-2
- Cycle 10: 2-11-12-8-13-2
- Cycle 11: 3-4-9-5-13-3
- Cycle 12: 3-6-2-12-11-3
- Cycle 13: 3-6-10-7-11-3
- Cycle 14: 3-14-11-2-6-3
- Cycle 15: 4-13-8-12-0-4
- Cycle 16: 4-13-14-11-7-4
- Cycle 17: 4-9-5-7-11-4
- Cycle 18: 4-3-6-10-7-4
- Cycle 19: 5-9-4-13-5
- Cycle 20: 5-9-1-10-6-5
- Cycle 21: 5-13-8-12-0-5
- Cycle 22: 6-10-1-9-5-6
- Cycle 23: 6-10-7-11-14-6
- Cycle 24: 7-5-13-8-12-7
- Cycle 25: 7-11-14-13-8-7
- Cycle 26: 8-13-4-3-6-8
- Cycle 27: 8-12-0-5-9-8
- Cycle 28: 11-14-13-4-9-11
- Cycle 29: 11-14-3-6-10-11
- Cycle 30: 12-8-13-4-9-12
- Cycle 31: 13-4-3-6-10-13
- Cycle 32: 14-11-7-5-9-14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 7: 2-12-11-14-6-2 has the chord (11, 14)
- Cycle 20: 5-9-1-10-6-5 has the chord (1, 10)
- Cycle 25: 7-11-14-13-8-7 has the chord (8, 13)
- Cycle 32: 14-11-7-5-9-14 has the chord (7, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 1. So, the final count is [1].
