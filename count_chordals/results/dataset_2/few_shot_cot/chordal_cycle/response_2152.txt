Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 12, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 8, 10, 6, 12, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 8, 10, 13, 2, 7, 12, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 8, 10, 13, 1, 11, 14, 9>
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 7, 12, 6, 10, 1, 11, 5, 0>
- Cycle 6: <4, 12, 6, 10, 1, 11, 14, 5, 4>
- Cycle 7: <4, 12, 6, 10, 1, 13, 2, 7, 12, 4>
- Cycle 8: <4, 12, 6, 10, 1, 13, 2, 0, 5, 4>
- Cycle 9: <4, 12, 6, 10, 1, 13, 6, 9, 7, 12, 4>
- Cycle 10: <4, 12, 6, 9, 7, 2, 13, 1, 10, 8, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 12, 0, 2, 7, 9, 6, 10, 1, 11, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 12, 0, 2, 7, 9, 8, 10, 13, 1, 4>
- Cycle 13: <4, 12, 0, 2, 7, 12, 6, 9, 14, 11, 4>
- Cycle 14: <4, 12, 0, 5, 11, 14, 9, 6, 10, 1, 4>
- Cycle 15: <11, 5, 0, 4, 12, 6, 9, 8, 10, 1, 11>
- Cycle 16: <11, 5, 0, 2, 13, 1, 10, 6, 9, 7, 11>
- Cycle 17: <11, 5, 0, 2, 7, 9, 8, 10, 6, 12, 11>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 9, 8, 10, 6, 12, 0> has one chord: (9, 12)
- <0, 9, 8, 10, 13, 2, 7, 12, 0> has one chord: (8, 12)
- <4, 12, 6, 10, 1, 13, 2, 7, 12, 4> has one chord: (6, 13)
- <4, 12, 0, 2, 7, 9, 6, 10, 1, 11, 4> has one chord: (9, 10)
- <4, 12, 0, 2, 7, 12, 6, 9, 14, 11, 4> has one chord: (6, 14)
- <11, 5, 0, 2, 13, 1, 10, 6, 9, 7, 11> has one chord: (9, 10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
