Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (1, 4, 2, 8, 1)
- (2, 4, 9, 16, 6, 2)
- (2, 4, 12, 9, 16, 6, 2)
- (2, 8, 19, 5, 11, 17, 10, 3, 19, 8)
- (3, 10, 14, 19, 8, 2, 17, 11, 5, 19, 14, 10, 3)
- (4, 12, 14, 10, 3, 19, 8, 2, 4)
  
Step 2: Checking for chords:
- <1, (2, 4), 8>
- <2, (4, 12), 9>
- <2, (4, 9), 16>
- <8, (2, 17), 19>
- <3, (10, 14), 19>
- <4, (2, 8), 12>

Step 3: Counting chordal 4-cycles: 
There are [6] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
