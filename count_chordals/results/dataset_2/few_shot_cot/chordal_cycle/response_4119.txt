Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, but not all of them contain all existing edges. 

Cycles with all existing edges: 
- <5, 9, 4, 7, 5>
- <5, 9, 7, 4, 5>
- <5, 9, 6, 4, 5>
- <5, 9, 2, 7, 5>
- <5, 9, 1, 6, 5>
- <5, 2, 7, 4, 5>
- <9, 4, 7, 0, 9>
- <9, 6, 4, 7, 9>
- <9, 7, 4, 0, 9>
- <4, 7, 0, 3, 4>
- <3, 0, 7, 9, 3>
- <0, 7, 9, 6, 0>
- <7, 4, 9, 5, 7>
- <6, 9, 5, 1, 6>
- <2, 5, 1, 6, 2>
- <1, 6, 8, 1, 5>
- <6, 8, 1, 5, 6>
- <1, 5, 2, 9, 1>
- <5, 2, 9, 6, 5>
- <2, 9, 7, 4, 2>
- <9, 7, 2, 3, 9>
- <7, 2, 3, 0, 7>
- <2, 3, 4, 9, 2>
- <3, 4, 9, 5, 3>

Step 2: 
From the above cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
- <5, 9, 4, 7, (2, 3), 5>

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
