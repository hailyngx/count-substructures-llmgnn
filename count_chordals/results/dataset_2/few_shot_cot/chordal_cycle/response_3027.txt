Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 4) (0, 8) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 2 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 2: 0 - 3 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 3: 0 - 6 - 4 - 5
- Cycle 4: 1 - 7 - 2 - 9
- Cycle 5: 3 - 4 - 9 - 2
- Cycle 6: 4 - 6 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 7: 4 - 9 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 8: 6 - 8 - 1 - 7
- Cycle 9: 7 - 9 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 10: 8 - 3 - 0 - 6

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <0, 9, 5, 4>, Chord: (0, 5)
- Chordal Cycle 2: <1, 7, 2, 9>, Chord: (1, 2)
- Chordal Cycle 3: <4, 6, 7, 1>, Chord: (4, 7)
- Chordal Cycle 4: <4, 9, 5, 1>, Chord: (4, 5)

Step 3:
The total number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [4].
