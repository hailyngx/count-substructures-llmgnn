Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <9, 26, 24, (12, 7)> <-- Chord present
- <9, 26, 22, (4, 0)> <-- Chord present
- <9, 27, 25, (15, 4)> <-- Chord present
- <9, 27, 29, (20, 3)> <-- Chord present
- <9, 27, 29, (2, 14)> <-- Chord present
- <26, 24, 12, (8, 14)> <-- Chord present
- <26, 24, 8, (20, 3)> <-- Chord present
- <26, 24, 8, (19, 15)> <-- Chord present
- <26, 24, 13, (7, 12)> <-- Chord present
- <26, 22, 4, (15, 19)> <-- Chord present
- &mldr;

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 

There are a total of [22] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
