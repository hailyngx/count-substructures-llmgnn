Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph with a length of 4 or more. We will list them below:
1. (1, 6, 3, 7) - Cycle of length 4
2. (1, 6, 5, 2) - Cycle of length 4
3. (1, 4, 7, 3) - Cycle of length 4
4. (1, 4, 5, 2) - Cycle of length 4
5. (2, 5, 4, 3) - Cycle of length 4
6. (2, 5, 6, 1) - Cycle of length 4
7. (2, 6, 3, 7) - Cycle of length 4
8. (2, 6, 1, 4) - Cycle of length 4
9. (3, 6, 1, 4) - Cycle of length 4
10. (3, 7, 4, 1) - Cycle of length 4
11. (3, 7, 1, 6) - Cycle of length 4
12. (4, 5, 2, 3) - Cycle of length 4
13. (4, 5, 6, 1) - Cycle of length 4
14. (4, 7, 3, 1) - Cycle of length 4
15. (4, 7, 1, 6) - Cycle of length 4
16. (5, 6, 1, 4) - Cycle of length 4
17. (5, 6, 3, 7) - Cycle of length 4
18. (5, 8, 3, 2) - Cycle of length 4
19. (5, 8, 2, 6) - Cycle of length 4
20. (6, 5, 2, 3) - Cycle of length 4
21. (6, 5, 4, 1) - Cycle of length 4
22. (6, 3, 7, 4) - Cycle of length 4
23. (6, 3, 2, 5) - Cycle of length 4
24. (7, 3, 2, 5) - Cycle of length 4
25. (7, 3, 6, 1) - Cycle of length 4
26. (7, 4, 1, 6) - Cycle of length 4
27. (7, 4, 5, 2) - Cycle of length 4
28. (8, 5, 2, 3) - Cycle of length 4
29. (8, 5, 6, 1) - Cycle of length 4
30. (8, 3, 7, 4) - Cycle of length 4
31. (8, 3, 2, 5) - Cycle of length 4
32. (9, 8, 3, 2) - Cycle of length 4
33. (9, 8, 5, 6) - Cycle of length 4
34. (9, 7, 3, 4) - Cycle of length 4
35. (9, 7, 4, 1) - Cycle of length 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Out of the listed cycles, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- <1, (6, 3), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Putting it all together, we have found one unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph. Therefore, the final answer is [1].
