Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph can be found as follows:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 3, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 4, 6, 1, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 4, 3, 1, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 9, 4, 3, 5, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 7, 5, 3, 1, 0>
- Cycle 8: <0, 7, 5, 3, 4, 0>
- Cycle 9: <0, 7, 8, 3, 5, 0>
- Cycle 10: <0, 7, 8, 3, 4, 0>
- Cycle 11: <0, 8, 7, 5, 3, 0>
- Cycle 12: <1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 13: <1, 6, 4, 3, 1>
- Cycle 14: <1, 6, 4, 9, 0, 5, 3, 1>
- Cycle 15: <1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 1>
- Cycle 16: <1, 3, 4, 9, 0, 5, 7, 1>
- Cycle 17: <1, 4, 9, 0, 5, 3, 1>
- Cycle 18: <1, 4, 9, 0, 7, 2, 6, 1>
- Cycle 19: <1, 4, 9, 0, 7, 5, 3, 1>
- Cycle 20: <1, 4, 3, 5, 0, 7, 2, 1>
- Cycle 21: <2, 6, 4, 9, 0, 5, 3, 2>
- Cycle 22: <3, 5, 0, 9, 4, 6, 1, 3>
- Cycle 23: <3, 5, 7, 0, 9, 4, 1, 3>
- Cycle 24: <3, 5, 7, 8, 0, 9, 4, 3>
- Cycle 25: <3, 7, 0, 5, 9, 4, 1, 3>
- Cycle 26: <3, 7, 0, 9, 4, 1, 3>
- Cycle 27: <3, 7, 2, 6, 4, 1, 3>
- Cycle 28: <4, 9, 0, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4>
- Cycle 29: <4, 9, 0, 7, 5, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle 30: <5, 0, 9, 4, 6, 1, 3, 5>
- Cycle 31: <5, 3, 7, 0, 9, 4, 1, 5>
- Cycle 32: <5, 7, 0, 9, 4, 1, 3, 5>
- Cycle 33: <7, 5, 0, 9, 4, 1, 3, 7>
- Cycle 34: <8, 0, 9, 4, 6, 1, 3, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: <<0, 9, 4, 6, 1, 0>>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [34].
