Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in this graph. The cycles are:
- Cycle 1: 5-9-1-4-5
- Cycle 2: 5-9-7-4-5
- Cycle 3: 5-8-7-4-5
- Cycle 4: 5-0-2-9-5
- Cycle 5: 5-3-1-4-5
- Cycle 6: 5-9-2-4-5
- Cycle 7: 5-9-2-3-5
- Cycle 8: 5-8-2-9-5
- Cycle 9: 5-8-2-3-5
- Cycle 10: 1-4-7-9-1
- Cycle 11: 1-3-2-9-1
- Cycle 12: 1-3-2-8-1

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (9,1)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (9,7)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord (8,7)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord (9,2)
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord (3,4)
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord (9,2)
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord (9,2)
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord (8,2)
- Cycle 9 has no chord
- Cycle 10 has no chord
- Cycle 11 has no chord
- Cycle 12 has no chord

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, there are 3 chordless cycles found: Cycle 9, Cycle 10, and Cycle 11.

Therefore, the final answer is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, (9, 2), 4>.
