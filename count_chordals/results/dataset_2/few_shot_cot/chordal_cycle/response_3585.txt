Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <5, 9, 7, 5>
- <5, 15, 4, 16>
- <5, 16, 1, 10>
- <5, 7, 13, 3>
- <9, 5, 15, 18>
- <9, 7, 13, 17>
- <9, 12, 14, 18>
- <6, 2, 11, 1>
- <1, 3, 17, 13>
- <1, 16, 4, 15>
- <1, 10, 18, 14>
- <3, 0, 19, 2>
- <3, 13, 7, 5>
- <0, 3, 1, 11>
- <0, 8, 11, 2>
- <7, 5, 16, 13>
- <8, 0, 19, 2>
- <4, 15, 18, 11>
- <13, 3, 1, 10>
- <16, 5, 7, 9>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: <5, 9, 7, 5>, where chord (9, 7) connects non-adjacent nodes in the cycle.

Step 3:
A total of [1] chordal 4-cycle is found in the graph.
