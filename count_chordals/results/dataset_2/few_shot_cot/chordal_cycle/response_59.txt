Response:
Let's follow the steps to find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 2, 19, 3, 11>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 5, 26, 27, 19>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 5, 26, 20, 6, 19>
- Cycle 4: <0, 17, 24, 1, 10, 11>
- Cycle 5: <0, 17, 24, 1, 8, 11>
- Cycle 6: <0, 17, 22, 28, 29, 25>
- Cycle 7: <4, 18, 17, 22, 28, 29>
- Cycle 8: <4, 18, 17, 24, 1, 10>
- Cycle 9: <4, 5, 26, 27, 19, 3>
- Cycle 10: <5, 26, 20, 6, 19, 3>
- Cycle 11: <10, 11, 3, 19, 27, 26>
- Cycle 12: <10, 11, 3, 19, 2, 4>
- Cycle 13: <10, 11, 8, 1, 24, 17>
- Cycle 14: <10, 11, 8, 16, 28, 22>
- Cycle 15: <10, 21, 25, 29, 28, 22>
- Cycle 16: <11, 3, 19, 2, 9, 7>
- Cycle 17: <11, 5, 26, 27, 19, 2>
- Cycle 18: <11, 8, 1, 24, 17, 22>
- Cycle 19: <16, 28, 29, 25, 21, 10>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 5, 26, 27, 19> has a chord (4, 26)
- <0, 17, 24, 1, 10, 11> has a chord (17, 10)
- <4, 5, 26, 27, 19, 3> has a chord (5, 19)
- <10, 11, 8, 1, 24, 17> has a chord (11, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [15].
