Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 5, 7, 4, 0> 
2. <1, 4, 7, 3, 1> 
3. <2, 5, 7, 3, 2> 
4. <4, 7, 3, 1, 4> 
5. <5, 7, 3, 1, 5> 
6. <6, 7, 3, 1, 6> 
7. <8, 5, 7, 3, 8> 
8. <9, 6, 7, 3, 9> 
9. <0, 5, 2, 1, 0> 
10. <0, 5, 2, 8, 0>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 5, 7, 4, 0> has a chord (4, 7)
- <1, 4, 7, 3, 1> has a chord (4, 3)
- <2, 5, 7, 3, 2> has a chord (5, 3)
- <4, 7, 3, 1, 4> has a chord (7, 1)
- <5, 7, 3, 1, 5> has a chord (7, 1)
- <8, 5, 7, 3, 8> has a chord (5, 3)
- <9, 6, 7, 3, 9> has a chord (6, 7)

Step 3:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].
