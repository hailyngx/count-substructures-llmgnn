Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 10, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 10, 0, 7, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 11, 3, 4, 5, 13, 2>
- Cycle 4: <2, 11, 3, 4, 7, 5, 13, 2>
- Cycle 5: <3, 11, 2, 13, 9, 5, 4, 3>
- Cycle 6: <3, 11, 2, 13, 9, 6, 8, 10, 0, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle 7: <3, 14, 7, 4, 5, 13, 2, 11, 3>
- Cycle 8: <3, 14, 7, 5, 9, 6, 8, 10, 0, 7>
- Cycle 9: <4, 3, 11, 2, 8, 6, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle 10: <4, 5, 9, 6, 8, 10, 0, 7, 4>
- Cycle 11: <5, 13, 9, 6, 8, 4, 7, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: Edge (0, 7)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: Edge (5, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 9 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [9].
