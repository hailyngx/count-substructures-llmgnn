Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 2, 3, 15, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 10, 4, 16, 6, 17, 5, 19, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 10, 14, 7, 19, 5, 17, 6, 16, 4, 10>
- Cycle 4: <1, 10, 14, 7, 6, 17, 5, 19, 13, 9, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 10, 14, 11, 0, 15, 3, 2, 11>
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 7, 14, 8, 17, 5, 19, 13, 9>
- Cycle 7: <1, 9, 12, 17, 6, 16, 4, 10, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 9, 13, 8, 14, 7, 19, 5, 17, 12, 9>
- Cycle 9: <1, 18, 17, 6, 16, 4, 10, 14, 11, 0, 15, 3, 2, 11>
- Cycle 10: <5, 17, 6, 16, 4, 10, 14, 7, 19, 13, 9, 12, 17, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (0, 2) and (3, 11)
- Cycle 2 has 2 chords: (1, 19) and (5, 17)
- Cycle 3 has 2 chords: (6, 14) and (7, 16)
- Cycle 4 has 2 chords: (9, 7) and (10, 5)
- Cycle 5 has 2 chords: (2, 14) and (10, 15)
- Cycle 6 has 2 chords: (1, 14) and (5, 13)
- Cycle 7 has 2 chords: (6, 17) and (9, 1)
- Cycle 8 has 2 chords: (9, 17) and (13. 7)
- Cycle 9 has 2 chords: (1, 11) and (10, 15)
- Cycle 10 has 2 chords: (5, 16) and (6, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the count is [0].
