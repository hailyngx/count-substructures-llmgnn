Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 7, 2, 8, 1> with chord (7, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 7, 13, 4, 12> with chord (7, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 6, 9, 1, 8> with chord (6, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 6, 11, 14, 8> with chord (6, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 7, 13, 4, 12> with chord (7, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 7, 13, 9, 1> with chord (7, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle <10, 12, 4, 13, 9> with chord (12, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle <13, 9, 1, 0, 7> with chord (9, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
