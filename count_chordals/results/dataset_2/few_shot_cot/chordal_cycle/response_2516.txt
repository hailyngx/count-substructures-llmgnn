Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 0, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 1, 0, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 8, 5, 7)
- Cycle 5: (5, 8, 2, 3, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 3, 1, 7, 5)
- Cycle 7: (9, 5, 7, 1, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 5, 3, 1, 9)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 5, 7, 4)
- Cycle 10: (4, 1, 7, 5, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 1, 3, 2, 4)
- Cycle 12: (7, 5, 3, 1, 7)
- Cycle 13: (1, 9, 5, 7, 1)

- Cycle 16: (1, 7, 5, 3, 1)
- Cycle 17: (3, 5, 0, 9, 3)
- Cycle 18: (3, 1, 9, 5, 3)
- Cycle 19: (3, 1, 4, 2, 3)
- Cycle 20: (8, 5, 7, 1, 8)
- Cycle 21: (6, 5, 3, 2, 6)
- Cycle 22: (2, 4, 8, 5, 2)
- Cycle 23: (2, 4, 1, 7, 2)
- Cycle 24: (2, 1, 3, 6, 2)
- Cycle 25: (2, 3, 6, 5, 2)
- Cycle 26: (0, 5, 7, 1, 0)
- Cycle 27: (0, 9, 1, 4, 0)

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (9, 4), 7>
- <2, (4, 1), 7>
- <2, (3, 6), 5>
- <2, (4, 8), 5>
- <5, (3, 6), 2>
- <5, (8, 4), 7>
- <5, (9, 0), 1>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [20].
