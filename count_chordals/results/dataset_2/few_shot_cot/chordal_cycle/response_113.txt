Response:
Step 1: 
Here are the cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 10, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (3, 7, 8, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 10, 1, 5, 12, 9, 0, 3)
- Cycle 4: (4, 10, 1, 12, 14, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 14, 8, 3, 4)
- Cycle 6: (5, 1, 3, 10, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 10, 4, 14, 12, 5)
- Cycle 8: (6, 7, 3, 1, 5, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 13, 12, 5, 0, 9, 8, 7, 6)
- Cycle 10: (8, 7, 3, 10, 11, 8)
- Cycle 11: (8, 14, 12, 9, 0, 8)
- Cycle 12: (9, 0, 5, 1, 12, 9)

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (10, 4), 3>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
