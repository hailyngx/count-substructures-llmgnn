Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle 1: 0 - 5 - 1 - 4 - 9 - 6 - 0
2. Cycle 2: 0 - 5 - 1 - 3 - 7 - 8 - 0
3. Cycle 3: 0 - 5 - 8 - 4 - 9 - 6 - 0
4. Cycle 4: 0 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 3 - 6 - 0
5. Cycle 5: 0 - 6 - 4 - 9 - 1 - 3 - 0
6. Cycle 6: 0 - 6 - 9 - 4 - 1 - 5 - 0
7. Cycle 7: 0 - 8 - 5 - 1 - 4 - 9 - 0
8. Cycle 8: 0 - 8 - 5 - 1 - 3 - 6 - 0
9. Cycle 9: 0 - 8 - 7 - 3 - 1 - 5 - 0
10. Cycle 10: 1 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 3 - 6 - 1
11. Cycle 11: 1 - 5 - 8 - 4 - 9 - 1
12. Cycle 12: 1 - 9 - 4 - 8 - 5 - 1
13. Cycle 13: 3 - 7 - 8 - 5 - 1 - 3
14. Cycle 14: 3 - 8 - 2 - 1 - 5 - 0

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
From the above list, the chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, (5, 8), 4, 9>
2. <0, (3, 7), 8, 5>
3. <1, (4, 9), 8, 5>
4. <3, (8, 2), 1, 5>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [4].
