Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 9, 3, 4>
- <0, 9, 7, 6>
- <1, 5, 9, 3>
- <2, 9, 7, 6>
- <3, 9, 7, 6>
- <4, 5, 9, 3>
- <6, 7, 9, 5>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for a chord:
- <0, 9, 3, 4> has a chord (9, 4)
- <0, 9, 7, 6> has a chord (9, 6)
- <1, 5, 9, 3> is chordless
- <2, 9, 7, 6> has a chord (9, 6)
- <3, 9, 7, 6> has a chord (9, 6)
- <4, 5, 9, 3> has a chord (5, 3)
- <6, 7, 9, 5> is chordless

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<1, 5, 9, 3>
<6, 7, 9, 5>
