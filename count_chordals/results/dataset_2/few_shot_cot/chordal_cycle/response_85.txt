Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 4, 5, 1>
- <0, 4, 18, 9>
- <0, 19, 0, 7>
- <1, 17, 16, 11>
- <2, 5, 1, 17>
- <2, 5, 4, 18>
- <3, 6, 9, 18>
- <3, 9, 6, 5>
- <3, 14, 10, 13>
- <4, 5, 2, 10>
- <4, 18, 7, 0>
- <5, 6, 3, 9>
- <5, 1, 17, 16>
- <6, 9, 18, 12>
- <7, 10, 2, 5>
- <7, 18, 4, 0>
- <8, 15, 7, 0>
- <9, 18, 4, 5>
- <10, 13, 12, 15>
- <11, 16, 15, 12>
- <12, 16, 17, 1>
- <13, 10, 2, 5>
- <14, 3, 6, 5>
- <14, 10, 7, 15>
- <15, 16, 17, 1>
- <16, 11, 16, 17>
- <17, 16, 15, 8>
- <18, 9, 6, 3>
- <19, 0, 4, 5>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, (4, 5), 1>
- <0, (4, 18), 9>
- <0, 19, (0, 7)>
- <1, (17, 16), 11>
- <2, (5, 1), 17>
- <2, (5, 4), 18>
- <3, (6, 9), 18>
- <3, (9, 6), 5>
- <3, 14, (10, 13)>
- <4, (5, 2), 10>
- <4, (18, 7), 0>
- <5, (6, 3), 9>
- <5, 1, (17, 16)>
- <6, (9, 18), 12>
- <7, (10, 2), 5>
- <7, (18, 4), 0>
- <8, 15, (7, 0)>
- <9, (18, 4), 5>
- <10, 13, (12, 15)>
- <11, 16, (15, 12)>
- <12, 16, (17, 1)>
- <13, 10, (2, 5)>
- <14, 3, (6, 5)>
- <14, (10, 7), 15>
- <15, 16, (17, 1)>
- <16, 11, (16, 17)>
- <17, 16, (15, 8)>
- <18, 9, (6, 3)>
- <19, 0, (4, 5)>

Step 3:
There are 27 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final answer is [27].
