Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <13, (6, 19), 0, 16)>.

Here is the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph:

Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <13, 6, 10, 14>
- <13, 6, 15, 18>
- <13, 6, 19, 7>
- <13, 12, 9, 14>
- <13, 1, 7, 19>
- <13, 1, 7, 19, 0>
- <13, 1, 7, 19, 6>
- <13, 1, 7, 19, 0, 16>
- <13, 5, 12, 3>
- <13, 5, 15, 18>
- <13, 5, 15, 4>
- <13, 12, 3, 0>
- <13, 12, 3, 4>
- <13, 12, 9, 14>
- <13, 12, 9, 14, 11>
- <13, 8, 16, 0>
- <13, 8, 16, 17>
- <13, 8, 16, 0, 19>
- <13, 8, 16, 17, 3>
- <6, 15, 18, 19>
- <6, 15, 4, 3>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <13, 6, 10, 14> has one chord: (6, 10)
- <13, 6, 15, 18> has one chord: (6, 18)
- <13, 6, 19, 7> has one chord: (6, 7)
- <13, 12, 9, 14> has one chord: (12, 9)
- <13, 1, 7, 19> has one chord: (1, 19)
- <13, 5, 15, 18> has one chord: (5, 18)
- <13, 12, 3, 0> has one chord: (12, 0)
- <13, 8, 16, 0> has one chord: (8, 16)
- <6, 15, 18, 19> has one chord: (15, 19)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal cycles found: [9]
