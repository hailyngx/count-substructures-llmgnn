Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <1, 6, 15, 10, 0> (length 4)
- <1, 6, 18, 3, 2> (length 4)
- <1, 6, 18, 9, 13> (length 4)
- <1, 18, 9, 13, 0> (length 4)
- <1, 18, 3, 4, 5> (length 4)
- <1, 18, 9, 7, 17> (length 4)
- <1, 18, 6, 16, 19> (length 4)
- <1, 18, 3, 4, 19> (length 4)
- <2, 12, 0, 13, 9> (length 4)
- <2, 12, 0, 10, 15> (length 4)
- <2, 12, 16, 6, 1> (length 4)
- <2, 12, 16, 19, 4> (length 4)
- <3, 10, 0, 12, 2> (length 4)
- <3, 10, 15, 6, 1> (length 4)
- <3, 18, 9, 13, 19> (length 4)
- <3, 18, 1, 6, 17> (length 4)
- <3, 18, 1, 6, 16> (length 4)
- <3, 4, 5, 12, 0> (length 4)
- <4, 5, 12, 0, 13> (length 4)
- <4, 19, 16, 6, 1> (length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <1, 18, 3, 4, 5> has a chord 3-5
- <1, 18, 6, 16, 19> has a chord 6-19
- <1, 18, 3, 4, 19> has a chord 3-19
- <2, 12, 0, 13, 9> has a chord 0-9
- <3, 18, 1, 6, 17> has a chord 1-17
- <3, 18, 1, 6, 16> has a chord 1-16
- <4, 19, 16, 6, 1> has a chord 6-16

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 20 cycles listed in Step 1 and 6 of them have exactly one chord.
- So, the number of chordless cycles is 20 - 6 = 14.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [14].
