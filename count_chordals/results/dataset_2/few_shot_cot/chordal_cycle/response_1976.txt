Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the given graph:
1. Cycle 1: <5, 1, 3, 5>
2. Cycle 2: <5, 3, 2, 9>
3. Cycle 3: <5, 9, 2, 6>
4. Cycle 4: <5, 9, 7, 4>
5. Cycle 5: <4, 7, 0, 4>
6. Cycle 6: <4, 0, 9, 5>
7. Cycle 7: <7, 4, 8, 7>
8. Cycle 8: <7, 8, 2, 3>
9. Cycle 9: <8, 2, 6, 4>
10. Cycle 10: <9, 6, 3, 5>
11. Cycle 11: <9, 5, 1, 5>
12. Cycle 12: <2, 3, 6, 9>
13. Cycle 13: <2, 9, 7, 4>
14. Cycle 14: <3, 1, 5, 9>
15. Cycle 15: <3, 6, 4, 7>
16. Cycle 16: <0, 4, 7, 9>
17. Cycle 17: <0, 7, 8, 4>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for a single chord:
- Cycle 1 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 2 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 3 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: Chord = (9, 4)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: Chord = (4, 7)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: Chord = (5, 9)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: Chord = (4, 7)
- Cycle 8 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 9 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 10 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 11 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 12 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 13 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 14 has 1 chord: Chord = (1, 5)
- Cycle 15 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 16 has 0 chords.
- Cycle 17 has 0 chords.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord) in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
