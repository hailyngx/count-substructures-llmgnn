Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 3) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph, but we are interested in cycles of length 4 or more. 
Here are the cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-5-4-0
- Cycle 2: 1-3-4-5-1
- Cycle 3: 2-9-4-3-2
- Cycle 4: 5-9-8-6-5
- Cycle 5: 6-8-2-7-6
- Cycle 6: 7-1-3-4-7
- Cycle 7: 8-9-7-2-8

Step 2:
Now, let's identify which of these cycles have exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, (9, 4), 5>
- Cycle 2: <1, (3, 5), 4>
- Cycle 3: <2, (9, 4), 3>
- Cycle 4: <5, (9, 8), 6>
- Cycle 5: <6, (8, 7), 2>
- Cycle 6: <7, (1, 4), 3>
- Cycle 7: <8, (9, 7), 2>

Step 3:
Since all identified cycles have exactly one chord, we have found 7 chordal 4-cycles. Hence, the final count is [7].
