Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle: <0, 5, 2, 8, 7, 0>
2. Cycle: <0, 5, 9, 4, 3, 0>
3. Cycle: <0, 5, 9, 3, 8, 0>
4. Cycle: <2, 5, 9, 4, 2>
5. Cycle: <2, 5, 9, 3, 8, 2>
6. Cycle: <2, 5, 8, 3, 0, 2>
7. Cycle: <2, 5, 8, 7, 0, 2>
8. Cycle: <3, 9, 5, 8, 3>
9. Cycle: <3, 9, 5, 2, 8, 3>
10. Cycle: <4, 9, 5, 2, 4>
11. Cycle: <4, 9, 5, 8, 0, 4>
12. Cycle: <4, 9, 3, 0, 4>
13. Cycle: <4, 3, 9, 5, 4>
14. Cycle: <5, 9, 3, 0, 5>
15. Cycle: <5, 9, 4, 2, 5>
16. Cycle: <5, 9, 8, 7, 5>
17. Cycle: <6, 7, 5, 0, 6>
18. Cycle: <6, 7, 2, 5, 8, 6>
19. Cycle: <7, 5, 0, 4, 7>
20. Cycle: <8, 5, 9, 3, 8>
21. Cycle: <8, 5, 9, 4, 2, 8>
22. Cycle: <8, 5, 2, 7, 0, 8>
23. Cycle: <9, 5, 2, 4, 9>
24. Cycle: <9, 5, 8, 3, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 5, 9, 4, 3, 0> (Chord: (9, 4))
Chordal 4-cycle found: <4, 9, 5, 8, 0, 4> (Chord: (5, 8))
Chordal 4-cycle found: <5, 9, 3, 0, 5> (Chord: (9, 3))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The total number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [3].
