Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 3) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 5, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 1, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 6, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 8, 4, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 5: <2, 0, 5, 1, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 0, 1, 7, 4, 8, 6, 2>
- Cycle 7: <2, 1, 7, 4, 8, 6, 0, 2>
- Cycle 8: <3, 7, 1, 0, 2, 9, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 7, 1, 8, 6, 0, 2, 9, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 8, 6, 5, 0, 2, 9, 3>
- Cycle 11: <3, 8, 6, 0, 5, 1, 7, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 12: <4, 7, 1, 0, 5, 6, 8, 4>
- Cycle 13: <5, 1, 7, 4, 0, 6, 5>
- Cycle 14: <6, 5, 0, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 15: <6, 8, 4, 7, 1, 5, 6>
- Cycle 16: <9, 0, 4, 7, 1, 2, 9>
- Cycle 17: <9, 0, 4, 8, 6, 5, 2, 9>
- Cycle 18: <9, 2, 1, 7, 4, 0, 6, 5, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 1, 0> - Chord: (4, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 5, 1, 7, 4, 0> - Chord: (1, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordless cycles: [16]
