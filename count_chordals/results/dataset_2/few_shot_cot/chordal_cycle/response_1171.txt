Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (0, 5, 1, 8)
- (1, 5, 7, 4)
- (2, 9, 4, 7)
- (3, 9, 2, 1)
- (4, 5, 7, 0)
- (4, 5, 8, 1)
- (4, 7, 0, 5)
- (5, 8, 1, 4)
- (5, 1, 3, 9)
- (7, 5, 8, 1)
- (7, 4, 5, 0)
- (9, 4, 7, 0)
- (9, 4, 5, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle (0, 5, 1, 8) has a chord (5, 8)
- The cycle (1, 5, 7, 4) has a chord (5, 4)
- The cycle (2, 9, 4, 7) has a chord (9, 7)
- The cycle (3, 9, 2, 1) has a chord (9, 2)
- The cycle (4, 5, 7, 0) has a chord (5, 7)
- The cycle (4, 5, 8, 1) has a chord (5, 8)
- The cycle (4, 7, 0, 5) has a chord (7, 5)
- The cycle (5, 8, 1, 4) has a chord (8, 1)
- The cycle (5, 1, 3, 9) has a chord (1, 9)
- The cycle (7, 5, 8, 1) has a chord (5, 8)
- The cycle (7, 4, 5, 0) has a chord (4, 5)
- The cycle (9, 4, 7, 0) has a chord (4, 7)
- The cycle (9, 4, 5, 0) has a chord (4, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 13 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [13].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 5, 1, 8>, <1, 5, 7, 4>, <2, 9, 4, 7>, <3, 9, 2, 1>, <4, 5, 7, 0>, <4, 5, 8, 1>, <4, 7, 0, 5>, <5, 8, 1, 4>, <5, 1, 3, 9>, <7, 5, 8, 1>, <7, 4, 5, 0>, <9, 4, 7, 0>, <9, 4, 5, 0>
