Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <0, 16, 25, 12, 6>
2. <0, 16, 25, 9, 27>
3. <0, 26, 15, 24, 15>
4. <1, 18, 5, 11, 2>
5. <1, 23, 26, 21, 10>
6. <2, 11, 14, 12, 6>
7. <2, 11, 14, 10, 21>
8. <2, 6, 14, 12, 25>
9. <3, 2, 11, 14, 12>
10. <4, 18, 5, 11, 2>
11. <4, 22, 15, 26, 21>
12. <5, 11, 14, 10, 21>
13. <5, 11, 14, 12, 25>
14. <6, 2, 11, 14, 10>
15. <6, 2, 11, 14, 12>
16. <7, 22, 8, 7, 5>
17. <9, 0, 16, 25, 12>
18. <9, 0, 26, 15, 24>
19. <9, 25, 12, 14, 6>
20. <10, 14, 12, 25, 16>
21. <10, 14, 12, 25, 23>
22. <10, 17, 23, 26, 21>
23. <11, 14, 12, 25, 16>
24. <14, 10, 17, 23, 1>
25. <14, 10, 21, 26, 15>
26. <15, 22, 7, 5, 11>
27. <18, 5, 11, 14, 12>
28. <20, 28, 1, 23, 26>

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <2, 11, 14, 12, 6> has a chord 12, making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <2, 6, 14, 12, 25> has a chord 12, making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <3, 2, 11, 14, 12> has a chord 12, making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <4, 22, 15, 26, 21> has a chord 26, making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <14, 10, 17, 23, 1> has a chord 17, making it a chordal 4-cycle.
- <14, 10, 21, 26, 15> has a chord 21, making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Therefore, the final number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
