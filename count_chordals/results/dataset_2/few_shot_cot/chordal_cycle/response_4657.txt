Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 9, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 8, 5, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 8, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 2, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 5: <2, 6, 4, 8, 2>
- Cycle 6: <4, 7, 2, 6, 4>
- Cycle 7: <5, 1, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 8: <5, 9, 6, 4, 5>
- Cycle 9: <8, 5, 9, 6, 8>
- Cycle 10: <7, 4, 8, 2, 7>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chord 3-5
- Cycle 2: Chord 3-5
- Cycle 3: Chord 3-8
- Cycle 4: Chord 2-7
- Cycle 5: Chord 6-4
- Cycle 6: Chord 7-2
- Cycle 7: Chord 1-4
- Cycle 8: Chord 6-4
- Cycle 9: Chord 5-9
- Cycle 10: Chord 2-8

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final answer is [10].
