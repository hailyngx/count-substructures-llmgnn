Response:
Based on the given information, let's count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 9, 8, 12, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 1, 3, 11, 2, 4, 8, 12, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 1, 14, 13, 11, 2, 4, 8, 5, 10, 0>
- Cycle 4: <7, 6, 1, 3, 11, 13, 14, 7>
- Cycle 5: <2, 6, 1, 9, 8, 4, 11, 3, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 6, 1, 3, 11, 13, 14, 7, 10, 8, 4, 2>
- Cycle 7: <4, 8, 5, 10, 0, 12, 11, 13, 14, 7, 10, 5, 8>
- Cycle 8: <3, 1, 9, 8, 12, 11, 13, 14, 7, 10, 0, 6, 7, 3>
- Cycle 9: <8, 9, 6, 7, 10, 5, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- For cycle 1, there is no chord.
- For cycle 2, there is a chord <2, 4>.
- For cycle 3, there is a chord <1, 4>.
- For cycle 4, there is no chord.
- For cycle 5, there is no chord.
- For cycle 6, there is no chord.
- For cycle 7, there is no chord.
- For cycle 8, there is no chord.
- For cycle 9, there is no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are 6 chordless cycles, so the final count is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 6, 1, 9, (8, 12), 0>
<0, 6, 1, (3, 11), 2, 4, 8, 12, 0>
<7, 6, 1, 3, 11, 13, 14, 7>
<2, 6, 1, 9, 8, 4, 11, 3, 2>
<2, 6, 1, 3, 11, 13, 14, 7, 10, 8, 4, 2>
<8, 9, 6, 7, 10, 5, 8>
