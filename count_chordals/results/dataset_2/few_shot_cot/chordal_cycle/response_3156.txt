- <0, 9, 14, 2> [Chord: (9, 14)]
- <0, 11, 1, 3> [Chord: (1, 11)]
- <1, 3, 7, 4> [Chord: (3, 7)]
- <1, 7, 13, 10> [Chord: (7, 13)]
- <1, 7, 4, 8> [Chord: (4, 8)]
- <2, 7, 13, 10> [Chord: (7, 13)]
- <4, 7, 2, 9> [Chord: (7, 2)]
- <5, 9, 4, 7> [Chord: (9, 4)]
- <7, 1, 11, 14> [Chord: (1, 11)]
- <7, 3, 1, 11> [Chord: (1, 11)]
