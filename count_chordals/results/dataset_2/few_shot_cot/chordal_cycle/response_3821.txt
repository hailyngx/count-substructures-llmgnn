Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 2, 3, 26, 24, 21, 5, 29, 12> with edges (0, 2), (2, 3), (3, 26), (26, 24), (24, 21), (21, 5), (5, 29), (29, 0), (0, 12)
- Cycle 2: <0, 2, 3, 26, 13, 11, 9, 15, 29> with edges (0, 2), (2, 3), (3, 26), (26, 13), (13, 11), (11, 9), (9, 15), (15, 29), (29, 0)
- Cycle 3: <0, 2, 3, 12, 8, 18, 13, 26, 24> with edges (0, 2), (2, 3), (3, 12), (12, 8), (8, 18), (18, 13), (13, 26), (26, 24), (24, 0)
- Cycle 4: <0, 16, 25, 14, 15, 6, 8, 12, 29> with edges (0, 16), (16, 25), (25, 14), (14, 15), (15, 6), (6, 8), (8, 12), (12, 29), (29, 0)
  
Step 2:
- The first and the third cycles have exactly one chord and are chordal 4-cycles. 
- The second and the fourth cycles do not have any chords.

Step 3:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [2].
