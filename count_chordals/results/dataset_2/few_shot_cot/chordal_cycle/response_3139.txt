Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:  
- Cycle 1: (5, 7, 9, 6, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 2, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 0, 7, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 7, 0, 8, 9)
- Cycle 5: (5, 1, 2, 4, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 2, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 7: (9, 7, 6, 1, 9)
- Cycle 8: (6, 1, 5, 9, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 2, 5, 7, 6)
- Cycle 10: (4, 0, 7, 6, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 2, 5, 9, 4)
- Cycle 12: (7, 0, 4, 5, 7)
- Cycle 13: (0, 4, 3, 8, 0)
- Cycle 14: (3, 8, 0, 4, 3)

Step 2: Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (6, 9)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (5, 6)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (0, 7)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (0, 8)
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has a chord (2, 9)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (6, 1)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 10 has a chord (7, 6)
- Cycle 11 has no chord
- Cycle 12 has no chord
- Cycle 13 has no chord
- Cycle 14 has no chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 4 chordless cycles.
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <5, 1, 2, 4>
- <9, 2, 6, 5>
- <4, 0, 7, 6>
- <3, 4, 8, 0>
