Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:

1. Cycle <0, 4, 9, 5>
2. Cycle <0, 4, 6, 1>
3. Cycle <0, 4, 2, 7>
4. Cycle <0, 7, 3, 8>
5. Cycle <1, 6, 3, 7>
6. Cycle <1, 6, 4, 9>
7. Cycle <1, 2, 7, 9>
8. Cycle <2, 5, 9, 4>
9. Cycle <2, 5, 8, 1>
10. Cycle <2, 4, 9, 7>
11. Cycle <2, 7, 9, 5>
12. Cycle <3, 7, 9, 5>
13. Cycle <3, 7, 2, 4>
14. Cycle <3, 0, 4, 9>
15. Cycle <3, 8, 5, 9>

Step 2:
Only one of these cycles has a chord, which is the cycle <0, 4, 9, 5> with the chord (4, 5).

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [14].
