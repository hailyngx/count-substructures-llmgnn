Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph, but we will list only the chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, 9, 5, 18>
2. <0, 17, 18, 5>
3. <4, 7, 15, 10>
4. <4, 11, 2, 1>
5. <4, 16, 12, 15>
6. <6, 7, 15, 10>
7. <6, 8, 16, 12>
8. <9, 5, 18, 17>
9. <9, 14, 10, 15>
10. <9, 14, 19, 18>
11. <11, 4, 7, 15>
12. <11, 8, 16, 12>
13. <13, 3, 16, 8>
14. <14, 11, 2, 1>
15. <14, 19, 18, 5>
16. <16, 3, 13, 11>
17. <16, 8, 11, 4>
18. <18, 5, 9, 0>
19. <18, 19, 14, 10>
20. <19, 14, 11, 4>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 9, 5, 18> (Chord: (5, 18))
2. <4, 7, 15, 10> (Chord: (7, 15))
3. <4, 11, 2, 1> (Chord: (2, 1))
4. <6, 8, 16, 12> (Chord: (8, 16))
5. <9, 14, 19, 18> (Chord: (19, 18))

Step 3:
Total number of chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord = [5]
