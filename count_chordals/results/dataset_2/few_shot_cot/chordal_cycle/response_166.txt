Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
The cycles in the graph are:  
1. Cycle: 1 - 17 - 19 - 11 - 1 (Chords: 17-19)  
2. Cycle: 1 - 17 - 3 - 12 - 0 - 1 (Chords: 17-3)  
3. Cycle: 1 - 4 - 14 - 23 - 17 - 1 (Chords: 4-14)  
4. Cycle: 1 - 2 - 21 - 13 - 4 - 20 - 7 - 12 - 1 (Chords: 2-13)  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:  
Out of the cycles listed above, only the cycle <1, 17, 19, 11> has exactly one chord (17-19).  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:  
As there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph, the count is [1].  
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 17, 19, 11>.
