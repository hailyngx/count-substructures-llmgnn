Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 1, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 3, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 8, 5, 9, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 3, 5, 9, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 5, 9, 8, 2>
- Cycle 6: <3, 0, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle 7: <3, 1, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle 8: <4, 8, 5, 3, 4>
- Cycle 9: <5, 9, 2, 6, 5>
- Cycle 10: <6, 0, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 11: <7, 0, 4, 3, 7>
- Cycle 12: <8, 0, 9, 5, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Only Cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 1, 3, 0> has a chord 1-7.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
 
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [0]
