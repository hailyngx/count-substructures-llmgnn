Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 2) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 8, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: 0-1-7-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-6-1-0
- Cycle 3: 0-6-7-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-3-5-7-0
- Cycle 5: 1-0-3-5-1
- Cycle 6: 1-2-7-5-1
- Cycle 7: 1-3-4-6-1
- Cycle 8: 3-0-1-6-3
- Cycle 9: 3-4-0-6-3
- Cycle 10: 4-0-1-2-4
- Cycle 11: 4-9-5-3-4
- Cycle 12: 5-3-1-7-5
- Cycle 13: 5-7-6-1-5
- Cycle 14: 6-0-8-3-6
- Cycle 15: 6-1-7-5-6
- Cycle 16: 6-3-4-0-6
- Cycle 17: 6-4-0-1-6
- Cycle 18: 7-1-6-4-7
- Cycle 19: 7-2-1-5-7

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
<0, 2, 1, 6> with chord (0, 6)
<0, 4, 3, 6> with chord (0, 3)
<1, 5, 7, 6> with chord (1, 7)

Step 3:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
