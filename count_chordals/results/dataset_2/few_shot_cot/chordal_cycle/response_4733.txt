Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 11) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 13) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 14) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 13) (3, 4) (8, 9) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 12) (13, 6) (13, 3) (13, 8) (13, 14) (13, 7) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 12) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 4) (7, 14) (10, 8) (10, 11) (10, 0) (10, 12) (11, 5) (11, 9) (11, 1) (11, 10) (0, 10) (0, 12) (14, 1) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (14, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 14) (12, 8) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 14) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, and node 12
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 11, and node 14
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 14
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 13, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 12
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 11, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 13, 4, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 13, 10, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 11, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 8, 11, 0, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 10
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 4, 10, 0, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 14, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 13, 7, 12, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <3, 5, 2, 9> (Chord: (5, 9))
- Cycle 2: <3, 6, 7, 4> (Chord: (6, 4))
- Cycle 3: <3, 13, 14, 7> (Chord: (13, 7))

Step 2:
- <3, 5, 2, 9> has one chord (5, 9)
- <3, 6, 7, 4> has one chord (6, 4)
- <3, 13, 14, 7> has one chord (13, 7)

Step 3:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [3].
