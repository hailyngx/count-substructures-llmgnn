Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (11, 14, 8, 2, 13, 7, 11) cycle
- (4, 12, 3, 16, 6, 7, 13, 4) cycle
- (17, 15, 13, 5, 14, 11, 18, 17) cycle

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle (11, 14, 8, 2, 13, 7, 11) has a chord (8, 13).
- The cycle (4, 12, 3, 16, 6, 7, 13, 4) has a chord (3, 6).
- The cycle (17, 15, 13, 5, 14, 11, 18, 17) has a chord (5, 11).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
- <11, 14, 8, 2, 13, 7, 11> with the chord (8, 13)
- <4, 12, 3, 16, 6, 7, 13, 4> with the chord (3, 6)
- <17, 15, 13, 5, 14, 11, 18, 17> with the chord (5, 11)
