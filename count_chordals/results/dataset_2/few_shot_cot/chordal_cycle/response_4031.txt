Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph can be counted step-by-step as follows:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 3, 12, 0> with no chord
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 1, 11, 0> with no chord
- Cycle 3: <0, 11, 14, 1, 0> with no chord
- Cycle 4: <0, 12, 13, 10, 0> with no chord
- Cycle 5: <2, 11, 14, 6, 2> with no chord

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 5, 3, 12, 0> has exactly one chord (5, 12).
- The cycle <0, 8, 1, 11, 0> has exactly one chord (8, 1).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of 2 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, namely <0, 5, 3, 12, 0> and <0, 8, 1, 11, 0>. Therefore, the count is [2].
