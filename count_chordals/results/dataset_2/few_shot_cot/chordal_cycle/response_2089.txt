Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (9, 8) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- The possible cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: <1, 3, 5, 8>
2. Cycle 2: <1, 4, 6, 5>
3. Cycle 3: <2, 6, 5, 8>
4. Cycle 4: <3, 5, 8, 4>
5. Cycle 5: <4, 8, 5, 6>
6. Cycle 6: <5, 6, 2, 8>
7. Cycle 7: <6, 7, 1, 3>
8. Cycle 8: <8, 5, 2, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Looking at the cycles:
1. Cycle 1: <1, 3, 5, 8> has chord (3, 8)
2. Cycle 2: <1, 4, 6, 5> has chord (4, 6)
3. Cycle 3: <2, 6, 5, 8> has chord (6, 8)
4. Cycle 4: <3, 5, 8, 4> has chord (5, 4)
5. Cycle 5: <4, 8, 5, 6> has chord (8, 6)
6. Cycle 6: <5, 6, 2, 8> has chord (6, 2)
7. Cycle 7: <6, 7, 1, 3> has chord (7, 1)
8. Cycle 8: <8, 5, 2, 0> has chord (5, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
