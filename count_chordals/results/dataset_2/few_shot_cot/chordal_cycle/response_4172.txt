- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 7, 5, 14>
- Cycle 6: <1, 2, 4, 5, 10>
- Cycle 7: <1, 2, 12, 6, 14>
- Cycle 8: <1, 4, 3, 11, 7>
- Cycle 9: <1, 4, 10, 5, 7>
- Cycle 10: <1, 6, 13, 11, 7>
- Cycle 11: <1, 14, 6, 12, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 3, 4, 11> (chord: 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 2, 4, 5> (chord: 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 4, 3, 11> (chord: 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 6, 13, 11> (chord: 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, 14, 6, 12> (chord: 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, 5, 7, 11> (chord: 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <4, 10, 2, 1> (chord: 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, 7, 14, 1> (chord: 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <7, 11, 13, 6> (chord: 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <9, 12, 2, 1> (chord: 6)
