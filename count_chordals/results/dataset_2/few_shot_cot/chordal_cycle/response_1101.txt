Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 15, 27, 4> has a chord 27-4
- <0, 4, 17, 5> has a chord 4-17
- <0, 4, 27, 14> has a chord 27-14
- <0, 15, 3, 8> has a chord 3-8
- <1, 8, 3, 15> has a chord 3-15
- <1, 7, 25, 22> has a chord 25-22
- <1, 11, 26, 21> has a chord 26-21
- <2, 7, 25, 22> has a chord 25-22
- <5, 3, 15, 27> has a chord 15-27
- <5, 17, 29, 21> has a chord 29-21
- <6, 15, 3, 8> has a chord 3-8
- <8, 3, 21, 29> has a chord 21-29
- <11, 26, 21, 3> has a chord 21-3
- <16, 29, 24, 22> has a chord 24-22
- <20, 25, 7, 1> has a chord 7-1

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 15 chordless cycles found.
Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [15].
