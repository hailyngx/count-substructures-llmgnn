Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <7, 3, 2, 15>
2. <7, 12, 16, 14>
3. <7, 12, 0, 17>
4. <7, 11, 13, 6>
5. <7, 5, 15, 9>
6. <7, 3, 0, 12>
7. <7, 11, 13, 15>
8. <12, 0, 18, 16>
9. <12, 0, 17, 19>
10. <12, 7, 5, 8>
11. <12, 16, 18, 2>
12. <5, 8, 10, 19>
13. <5, 8, 4, 6>
14. <5, 7, 11, 13>
15. <5, 7, 12, 19>
16. <5, 15, 13, 11>
17. <0, 18, 16, 14>
18. <0, 12, 7, 11>
19. <0, 12, 19, 10>
20. <0, 3, 2, 15>
21. <0, 3, 7, 11>
22. <2, 16, 14, 17>
23. <2, 16, 18, 0>
24. <2, 15, 5, 8>
25. <2, 3, 7, 11>
26. <16, 14, 17, 0>
27. <16, 18, 0, 3>
28. <16, 12, 19, 10>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <7, 3, 2, 15, (5, 8)>
2. <7, 5, 15, 9, (13, 11)>
3. <0, 18, 16, 14, (17, 2)>
4. <16, 18, 0, 3, (12, 2)>

Step 3:
There are [4] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
