Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 5, 9, 4, 7>
- <0, 5, 13, 17, 1>
- <0, 5, 9, 18, 16>
- <0, 19, 17, 1, 15>
- <1, 15, 6, 12, 7>
- <1, 10, 3, 9, 5>
- <1, 17, 16, 11, 7>
- <2, 5, 13, 17, 1>
- <3, 10, 1, 17, 13>
- <4, 7, 12, 6, 15>
- <5, 9, 4, 7, 11>
- <5, 9, 3, 10, 1>
- <5, 13, 17, 16, 11>
- <6, 15, 11, 7, 12>
- <7, 11, 16, 18, 9>
- <9, 18, 19, 17, 16>
- <9, 18, 16, 11, 7>
- <12, 7, 11, 15, 6>
- <13, 5, 9, 18, 19>
  
Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, 5, 9, 4> with chord (5, 9)
- <0, 5, 13, 17> with chord (5, 17)
- <0, 5, 9, 18> with chord (5, 9)
- <0, 19, 17, 1> with chord (17, 1)
- <1, 15, 6, 12> with chord (6, 15)
- <1, 10, 3, 9> with chord (3, 9)
- <1, 17, 16, 11> with chord (16, 11)
- <2, 5, 13, 17> with chord (5, 13)
- <3, 10, 1, 17> with chord (10, 1)
- <4, 7, 12, 6> with chord (7, 12)
- <5, 9, 4, 7> with chord (9, 7)
- <5, 9, 3, 10> with chord (9, 3)
- <5, 13, 17, 16> with chord (13, 17)
- <6, 15, 11, 7> with chord (11, 7)

Step 3:
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [14].
