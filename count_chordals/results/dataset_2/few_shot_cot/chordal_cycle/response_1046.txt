Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 7, 8, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 2, 4, 6, 1)
- Cycle 4: (3, 1, 2, 7, 3)
- Cycle 5: (4, 8, 6, 5, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 9, 2, 7, 4)
- Cycle 7: (6, 5, 7, 8, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 5, 7, 1, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 8, 7, 2, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 9, 4, 8, 6)
- Cycle 11: (7, 5, 6, 9, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 5, 6, 1, 7)
- Cycle 13: (8, 7, 2, 9, 8)
- Cycle 14: (8, 7, 2, 1, 8)
- Cycle 15: (9, 4, 8, 7, 9)
- Cycle 16: (9, 4, 8, 1, 9)

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (5, 7) and (7, 2)
- Cycle 2 has 2 chords: (5, 7) and (7, 8)
- Cycle 3 has 2 chords: (1, 4) and (4, 6)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (1, 2)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (6, 5)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (4, 2)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (6, 8)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (7, 2)
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 12 has 1 chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle 13 has 1 chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 14 has 1 chord: (7, 2)
- Cycle 15 has 1 chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 16 has 1 chord: (4, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (1, 2), 5, 7, 8>
- <2, (1, 4), 6, 1, 5>
- <3, (4, 2), 6, 5, 7>
- <4, (1, 2), 7, 3, 1>
- <5, (4, 6), 8, 4, 9>
- <6, (6, 8), 7, 9, 4>
- <7, (5, 6), 1, 7, 8>
- <8, (5, 7), 6, 1, 7>
- <9, (7, 2), 8, 6, 5>
- <10, (4, 6), 8, 6, 5>
- <11, (5, 6), 7, 9, 6>
- <12, (5, 6), 7, 1, 6>
- <13, (7, 8), 2, 9, 8>
- <14, (7, 2), 8, 1, 8>
- <15, (4, 8), 9, 7, 4>
- <16, (4, 8), 9, 1, 9>
