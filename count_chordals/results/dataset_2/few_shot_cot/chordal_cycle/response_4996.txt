Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 7, 4, 14>
2. <0, 7, 11, 1>
3. <0, 1, 5, 8>
4. <0, 1, 9, 14>
5. <1, 11, 2, 8>
6. <1, 11, 9, 7>
7. <2, 3, 12, 9>
8. <2, 3, 8, 5>
9. <2, 8, 10, 14>
10. <2, 8, 6, 13>
11. <3, 2, 11, 1>
12. <3, 12, 9, 14>
13. <3, 12, 5, 1>
14. <4, 7, 11, 1>
15. <4, 7, 9, 14>
16. <4, 10, 8, 5>
17. <4, 10, 13, 6>
18. <5, 1, 9, 14>
19. <5, 8, 6, 13>
20. <7, 9, 12, 3>
21. <8, 5, 13, 6>
22. <9, 7, 11, 2>
23. <9, 8, 10, 14>
24. <9, 14, 13, 6>
25. <10, 8, 6, 13>
26. <13, 14, 9, 7>

Step 2:
After checking each cycle, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 7, 4, 14, 10>
2. <1, 11, 2, 8, 10>
3. <1, 11, 9, 7, 4>
4. <3, 12, 9, 14, 4>
5. <4, 10, 8, 5, 1>
6. <9, 7, 11, 2, 3>
7. <9, 8, 10, 14, 13>
8. <10, 8, 6, 13, 14>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [18].
