Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 7, 15, 11> has a chord (3, 15)
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, 5, 0, 9> has a chord (4, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, 3, 12, 9> has a chord (3, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 5, 2, 9> has a chord (5, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 18, 17, 10> has a chord (18, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 9, 12, 3> has a chord (9, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [46].

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
