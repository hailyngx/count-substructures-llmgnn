Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:

1. <0, 7, 11, 14, 0>
2. <0, 7, 5, 13, 0>
3. <1, 6, 9, 7, 1>
4. <1, 4, 7, 5, 1>
5. <2, 0, 7, 5, 2>
6. <2, 0, 14, 3, 2>
7. <2, 13, 5, 7, 2>
8. <4, 7, 0, 14, 4>
9. <4, 7, 9, 6, 4>
10. <5, 6, 9, 7, 5>
11. <8, 4, 7, 0, 8>
12. <8, 4, 12, 14, 8>
13. <10, 6, 9, 7, 10>
14. <11, 1, 6, 5, 11>
15. <11, 1, 4, 7, 11>
16. <11, 3, 14, 12, 11>
17. <11, 13, 5, 7, 11>
18. <12, 6, 9, 7, 12>
19. <12, 4, 7, 9, 12>
20. <12, 4, 8, 14, 12>
21. <12, 8, 14, 13, 12>
22. <13, 5, 7, 9, 13>
23. <13, 11, 14, 12, 13>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

1. <0, 7, 11, 14, 0>
   Chord: (7, 14)

2. <11, 1, 6, 5, 11>
   Chord: (1, 5)

3. <11, 3, 14, 12, 11>
   Chord: (3, 14)

4. <12, 6, 9, 7, 12>
   Chord: (6, 7)

5. <12, 8, 14, 13, 12>
   Chord: (8, 13)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [5].
