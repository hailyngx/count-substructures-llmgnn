Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 5, 6, 9>
2. <0, 5, 2, 1> 
3. <0, 5, 8, 4>
4. <0, 5, 1, 3>
5. <1, 5, 2, 6>
6. <1, 5, 8, 4>
7. <1, 5, 6, 9>
8. <1, 5, 9, 7>
9. <2, 5, 1, 3>
10. <2, 5, 8, 4>
11. <2, 5, 1, 6>
12. <3, 9, 5, 6>
13. <3, 9, 7, 4>
14. <4, 7, 9, 5>
15. <4, 7, 0, 5>
16. <4, 7, 9, 3>
17. <5, 9, 7, 4>
18. <5, 9, 3, 1>
19. <5, 9, 7, 0>
20. <6, 9, 5, 1>
21. <6, 9, 7, 4>
22. <7, 9, 5, 6>
23. <7, 9, 3, 1>
24. <8, 5, 1, 3>
25. <8, 5, 2, 1>
26. <8, 5, 4, 7>
27. <9, 5, 6, 1>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, (7, 9), 5, 6>
2. <0, (2, 1), 5, 8>
3. <0, (1, 3), 5, 4>
4. <1, (2, 6), 5, 9>
5. <1, (8, 4), 5, 6>
6. <1, (9, 7), 5, 2>
7. <2, (1, 3), 5, 8>
8. <2, (4, 7), 5, 1>
9. <3, (5, 6), 9, 7>
10. <4, (5, 9), 7, 0>

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found = [1]
