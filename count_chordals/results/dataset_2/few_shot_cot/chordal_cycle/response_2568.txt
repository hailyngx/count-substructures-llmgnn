Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 3) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <0, 6, 5, 1> 
2. <0, 6, 3, 7> 
3. <0, 7, 8, 1> 
4. <0, 7, 9, 5> 
5. <1, 5, 6, 9> 
6. <1, 5, 2, 8> 
7. <1, 8, 7, 3> 
8. <2, 5, 9, 6> 
9. <2, 5, 1, 0> 
10. <2, 6, 3, 4> 
11. <3, 6, 5, 9> 
12. <3, 6, 2, 8> 
13. <3, 4, 9, 5> 
14. <4, 9, 5, 1> 
15. <7, 9, 5, 1> 
16. <7, 9, 6, 3> 
17. <8, 2, 5, 9> 
18. <8, 2, 6, 3> 

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <2, 5, 9, 6> has a chord (5, 6)
- <2, 5, 1, 0> has a chord (5, 0)
- <3, 4, 9, 5> has a chord (4, 5)
- <7, 9, 5, 1> has a chord (9, 1)

Step 3:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
