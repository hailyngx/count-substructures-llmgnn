Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 0) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 6, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle: <0, 1, 4, 0>
2. Cycle: <0, 1, 5, 4, 0>
3. Cycle: <0, 1, 6, 0>
4. Cycle: <0, 1, 7, 3, 4, 0>
5. Cycle: <0, 5, 2, 7, 1, 0>
6. Cycle: <1, 3, 4, 0, 1>
7. Cycle: <1, 3, 7, 2, 5, 1>
8. Cycle: <1, 3, 8, 6, 0, 1>
9. Cycle: <1, 5, 2, 7, 3, 1>
10. Cycle: <2, 5, 4, 0, 6, 2>
11. Cycle: <2, 5, 7, 3, 2>
12. Cycle: <6, 0, 1, 7, 2, 6>
13. Cycle: <6, 1, 7, 3, 8, 6>
14. Cycle: <6, 2, 7, 3, 8, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle is:
<0, 1, 5, 4, 0> with a chord (2, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As there is one unique chordal 4-cycle found, the count is [1].
