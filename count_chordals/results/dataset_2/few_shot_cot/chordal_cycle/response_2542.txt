Response:
The graph contains the following chordal 4-cycle:

<0, (2, 12), 10, 7>

As per the steps mentioned:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges: {(0, 2, 12, 10), (0, 2, 12, 13), (0, 3, 8, 5), (0, 3, 8, 14), (0, 5, 8, 4), (0, 5, 10, 9), (1, 4, 8, 5), (1, 4, 8, 9), (1, 4, 9, 7), (1, 7, 6, 3), (1, 7, 6, 4), (2, 8, 4, 1), (2, 8, 4, 6), (2, 8, 5, 0), (2, 8, 5, 10), (2, 8, 14, 3), (2, 13, 12, 10), (2, 13, 12, 0), (3, 6, 4, 8), (3, 6, 7, 1), (3, 6, 7, 10), (3, 7, 1, 4), (3, 7, 6, 4), (3, 7, 9, 1), (3, 14, 8, 4), (3, 14, 13, 2), (4, 8, 5, 10), (4, 8, 9, 1), (4, 9, 1, 7), (4, 9, 7, 6), (4, 10, 5, 0), (5, 8, 4, 6), (5, 8, 4, 9), (5, 10, 12, 0), (5, 10, 7, 1), (6, 3, 7, 1), (6, 3, 7, 10), (6, 4, 8, 5), (6, 4, 9, 7), (6, 7, 1, 4), (6, 7, 3, 8), (7, 1, 4, 8), (7, 1, 4, 9), (7, 6, 3, 14), (7, 6, 4, 8), (7, 6, 4, 9), (7, 9, 1, 4), (7, 9, 10, 5), (8, 2, 13, 12), (8, 4, 6, 3), (8, 4, 9, 1), (8, 4, 5, 0), (8, 4, 5, 10), (8, 5, 0, 2), (8, 5, 10, 4), (8, 14, 3, 6), (9, 1, 7, 6), (9, 1, 7, 10), (9, 4, 6, 3), (9, 4, 8, 5), (9, 7, 1, 4), (9, 7, 6, 3), (9, 10, 5, 8), (9, 10, 7, 1), (10, 5, 8, 4), (10, 5, 8, 14), (10, 5, 0, 2), (10, 5, 0, 12), (10, 7, 1, 4), (10, 7, 9, 1), (10, 12, 2, 13), (10, 12, 0, 5), (11, 0, 5, 8), (11, 0, 2, 8), (11, 0, 12, 2), (11, 9, 4, 8), (11, 9, 4, 1), (12, 2, 8, 5), (12, 2, 8, 14), (12, 2, 13, 14), (12, 0, 5, 10), (12, 0, 11, 9), (13, 2, 8, 5), (13, 2, 8, 14), (13, 12, 0, 5), (13, 14, 8, 4), (13, 14, 3, 6), (14, 3, 8, 4), (14, 3, 6, 4), (14, 13, 2, 8), (14, 13, 12, 10)}

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord. Only the cycle <0, (2, 12), 10, 7> has exactly one chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is [1].
