Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, such as: 
- (3, 9, 6, 26)
- (3, 9, 20, 19)
- (3, 22, 4, 1)
- (9, 6, 26, 21)
- (9, 20, 19, 8)
- (9, 20, 23, 16)
- (9, 3, 22, 4)
- (6, 26, 21, 7)
- (6, 26, 5, 11)
- (6, 9, 20, 23)
- (7, 21, 26, 5)

- (21, 11, 10, 12)
- (10, 11, 5, 26)
- (10, 11, 21, 7)
- (10, 12, 27, 4)
- (11, 5, 26, 21)
- (11, 5, 2, 20)
- (11, 21, 26, 6)
- (12, 10, 11, 5)
- (12, 27, 4, 22)
- (12, 18, 13, 0)
- (27, 12, 10, 11)
- (27, 4, 22, 3)
- (27, 17, 1, 24)
- (19, 8, 28, 1)
- (19, 20, 2, 5)
- (26, 6, 9, 20)
- (26, 6, 9, 3)
- (26, 21, 7, 25)
- (26, 21, 11, 5)
- (26, 5, 11, 21)
- (26, 5, 2, 0)
- (1, 17, 27, 4)
- (1, 17, 0, 13)
- (1, 24, 15, 25)
- (1, 24, 8, 19)
- (17, 27, 4, 22)
- (17, 27, 12, 10)
- (4, 27, 12, 10)
- (4, 22, 3, 9)
- (4, 22, 3, 9)
- (4, 13, 18, 12)
- (25, 15, 24, 8)
- (25, 7, 21, 26)
- (28, 1, 17, 27)
- (28, 1, 24, 15)
- (28, 8, 19, 20)
- (8, 19, 20, 23)
- (8, 24, 15, 25)
- (8, 24, 1, 4)

Step 2: 
After checking all the cycles, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <3, (9, 6), 26>
- <3, (9, 20), 19>
- <3, (22, 4), 1>
- <6, (9, 26), 21>
- <9, (20, 19), 8>
- <9, (20, 23), 16>
- <9, (3, 22), 4>
- <21, (26, 5), 11>
- <21, (26, 6), 9>
- <21, (11, 5), 26>
- <21, (11, 10), 7>
- <11, (5, 26), 21>
- <11, (5, 2), 20>
- <12, (27, 4), 22>
- <12, (18, 13), 0>
- <28, (1, 17), 27>
- <17, (27, 4), 22>
- <25, (15, 24), 8>
  
Step 3:
Thus, there are [17] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
