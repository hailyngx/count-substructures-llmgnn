Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
1. <0, 6, 3, 1, 8> 
2. <0, 6, 7, 5, 8> 
3. <1, 9, 4, 2, 8> 
4. <2, 9, 4, 1, 3> 

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord are: 
1. <0, 6, 3, 1, 8> with chord (6, 1) 
2. <1, 9, 4, 2, 8> with chord (9, 2) 

Step 3: 
The number of chordless cycles found is [2]. 

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are: 
1. <0, 6, 3, 1, 8> 
2. <1, 9, 4, 2, 8>
