Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-10-7-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-10-1-16-0
- Cycle 3: 0-17-16-12-5-0
- Cycle 4: 2-9-6-4-2
- Cycle 5: 2-9-14-1-16-2
- Cycle 6: 3-11-1-16-3
- Cycle 7: 3-11-8-6-4-3
- Cycle 8: 3-15-3
- Cycle 9: 4-6-8-12-4
- Cycle 10: 4-9-14-1-11-4
- Cycle 11: 4-18-8-12-5-4
- Cycle 12: 5-0-10-7-5
- Cycle 13: 5-12-2-9-4-5
- Cycle 14: 6-8-11-3-6
- Cycle 15: 6-9-12-16-6
- Cycle 16: 6-18-14-1-11-6
- Cycle 17: 8-11-3-13-8
- Cycle 18: 8-12-16-17-8
- Cycle 19: 9-6-8-12-9
- Cycle 20: 9-12-16-17-9
- Cycle 21: 9-14-1-11-9
- Cycle 22: 10-0-17-16-10
- Cycle 23: 12-16-1-11-12
- Cycle 24: 14-9-12-16-14

Step 2:
After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following chordal 4-cycle:
- <0, (5, 12), 17, 16, 0>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [24].
