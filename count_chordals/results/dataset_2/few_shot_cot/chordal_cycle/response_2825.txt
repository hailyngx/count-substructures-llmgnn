Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle <0, 4, 3, 7>
- Cycle <0, 4, 5, 9>
- Cycle <0, 1, 7, 5>
- Cycle <0, 1, 5, 9>
- Cycle <1, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle <1, 5, 9, 8>
- Cycle <1, 5, 9, 2>
- Cycle <1, 3, 7, 4>
- Cycle <1, 3, 4, 5>
- Cycle <2, 9, 5, 6>
- Cycle <2, 9, 8, 6>
- Cycle <3, 9, 2, 8>
- Cycle <3, 9, 5, 4>
- Cycle <3, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle <3, 4, 5, 9>
- Cycle <4, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle <5, 9, 8, 6>
- Cycle <5, 9, 2, 0>
- Cycle <6, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle <6, 5, 1, 7>
- Cycle <7, 6, 8, 9>
- Cycle <7, 6, 5, 9>
- Cycle <8, 9, 5, 6>
- Cycle <8, 9, 2, 0>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 7, 5> (Chord: (4, 7))
- <0, 4, 3, 7> (Chord: (4, 3))
- <0, 4, 5, 9> (Chord: (4, 5))
- <0, 1, 7, 5> (Chord: (1, 7))
- <0, 1, 5, 9> (Chord: (1, 5))
- <1, 5, 7, 4> (Chord: (5, 7))
- <1, 5, 9, 8> (Chord: (5, 9))
- <1, 5, 9, 2> (Chord: (5, 9))
- <1, 3, 7, 4> (Chord: (3, 7))
- <1, 3, 4, 5> (Chord: (3, 4))
- <2, 9, 5, 6> (Chord: (5, 6))
- <2, 9, 8, 6> (Chord: (8, 6))
- <3, 9, 2, 8> (Chord: (9, 2))
- <3, 9, 5, 4> (Chord: (5, 4))
- <3, 4, 7, 5> (Chord: (4, 7))
- <3, 4, 5, 9> (Chord: (4, 5))
- <4, 7, 6, 5> (Chord: (7, 6))
- <5, 9, 8, 6> (Chord: (9, 8))
- <5, 9, 2, 0> (Chord: (9, 2))
- <6, 5, 7, 4> (Chord: (5, 7))
- <6, 5, 1, 7> (Chord: (5, 7))
- <7, 6, 8, 9> (Chord: (6, 8))
- <7, 6, 5, 9> (Chord: (6, 5))
- <8, 9, 5, 6> (Chord: (9, 5))
- <8, 9, 2, 0> (Chord: (9, 2))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 25 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [25].
