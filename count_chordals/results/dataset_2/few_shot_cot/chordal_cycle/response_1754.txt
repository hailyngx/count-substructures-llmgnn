Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 6, 4, 5> (chord 6, 4)
- Cycle 2: <1, 9, 6, 4, 1> (chord 9, 4)
- Cycle 3: <3, 1, 6, 4, 3> (chord 1, 6)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycles 1, 2, and 3 have exactly one chord each.

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, 9, 6, 4>
- <1, 9, 6, 4>
- <3, 1, 6, 4>
