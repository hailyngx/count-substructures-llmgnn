Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2)

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-7-5-2-0
- Cycle 2: 1-4-5-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-3-7-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-4-5-1
- Cycle 5: 1-6-8-2-1
- Cycle 6: 3-4-6-9-3
- Cycle 7: 3-7-5-2-3
- Cycle 8: 3-7-9-8-3
- Cycle 9: 3-9-6-4-3
- Cycle 10: 7-5-4-1-7
- Cycle 11: 7-9-8-6-7

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycles with exactly one chord are:
  - Cycle 1 (<0, (7, 2), 5>) with chord (7, 2)
  - Cycle 2 (<1, (4, 5), 2>) with chord (4, 5)
  - Cycle 4 (<1, (6, 5), 4>) with chord (6, 5)
  - Cycle 6 (<3, (4, 6), 9>) with chord (4, 6)
  - Cycle 7 (<3, (7, 5), 2>) with chord (7, 5)
  - Cycle 8 (<3, (7, 9), 8>) with chord (7, 9)
  - Cycle 9 (<3, (6, 4), 9>) with chord (6, 4)
  - Cycle 10 (<7, (4, 1), 5>) with chord (4, 1)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There are a total of 8 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [8].
