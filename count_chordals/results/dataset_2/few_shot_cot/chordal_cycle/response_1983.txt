Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in this graph, but we will focus on cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 2, 1, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 8, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 1, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 5: <9, 4, 7, 5, 9>
- Cycle 6: <9, 8, 5, 1, 9>
- Cycle 7: <9, 2, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 8: <4, 9, 2, 5, 4>
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 5, 9, 4>
- Cycle 10: <4, 8, 5, 1, 4>
- Cycle 11: <7, 5, 1, 8, 7>
- Cycle 12: <7, 4, 8, 5, 7>
- Cycle 13: <7, 0, 6, 7>
- Cycle 14: <8, 5, 1, 7, 8>
- Cycle 15: <8, 9, 5, 4, 8>
- Cycle 16: <8, 4, 7, 0, 8>
- Cycle 17: <0, 4, 9, 3, 0>
- Cycle 18: <0, 7, 5, 1, 0>
- Cycle 19: <0, 3, 9, 0>
- Cycle 20: <1, 5, 2, 9, 1>
- Cycle 21: <1, 7, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle 22: <6, 7, 5, 8, 6>
- Cycle 23: <2, 5, 9, 3, 2>
- Cycle 24: <2, 9, 4, 8, 2>
- Cycle 25: <2, 1, 7, 5, 2>
- Cycle 26: <3, 9, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 27: <3, 0, 4, 9, 3>

Step 2:
Only Cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 7, 5> has exactly one chord, which is edge (9, 4).

Step 3:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, namely <5, 9, 4, 7, 5>.
So, the final count is [1].
