Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
