Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) (9, 4) (9, 0) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 3, 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 0, 1, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <1, 4, 6, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 2, 1>
- Cycle 3: <3, 6, 5, 3>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 9, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 4, 9, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 1, 2, 7, 3, 0>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has no chords.
- Cycle 6 has one chord: Chord <1, 7> in cycle <0, 1, 2, 7, 3, 0>.

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 1, 2, 7, 3, 0>
