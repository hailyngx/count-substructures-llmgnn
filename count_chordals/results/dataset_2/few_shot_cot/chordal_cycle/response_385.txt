Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 2) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 2, 0> 
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 9, 7, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 6, 4, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 9, 2, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 5, 6, 4, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 9, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle 9: <3, 9, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle 10: <4, 7, 8, 6, 4>
- Cycle 11: <5, 9, 2, 3, 5>
- Cycle 12: <5, 9, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 13: <6, 7, 8, 4, 6>
- Cycle 14: <7, 9, 2, 3, 7>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: Chord found: (1, 6)
- Cycle 2: Chord found: (5, 9)
- Cycle 3: Chord found: (5, 9)
- Cycle 4: Chord found: (5, 4)
- Cycle 5: Chord found: (5, 9)
- Cycle 6: Chord found: (5, 9)
- Cycle 7: Chord found: (5, 4)
- Cycle 8: Chord found: (9, 2)
- Cycle 9: Chord found: (7, 4)
- Cycle 10: Chord found: (7, 8)
- Cycle 11: Chord found: (9, 5)
- Cycle 12: Chord found: (9, 7)
- Cycle 13: Chord found: (7, 8)
- Cycle 14: Chord found: (7, 2)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 2 chordless cycles found: Cycle 4 and Cycle 13.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
