Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 0

Response:
Following the steps mentioned, let's find the chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle: <1, 5, 2, 6>
- Cycle: <1, 5, 7, 6>
- Cycle: <1, 5, 4, 6>
- Cycle: <1, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle: <1, 5, 7, 0, 8>
- Cycle: <1, 5, 2, 8>
- Cycle: <1, 5, 2, 8, 0>
- Cycle: <1, 5, 4, 3>
- Cycle: <1, 5, 4, 3, 0>
- Cycle: <1, 5, 7, 0, 9, 8, 2>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <1, 5, 2, 8> has one chord: (1, 2)
- The cycle <1, 5, 7, 0> has one chord: (5, 0)
- The cycle <1, 5, 7, 0, 8> has one chord: (7, 8)
- The cycle <1, 5, 4, 3> has one chord: (1, 4)
- The cycle <1, 5, 2, 8, 0> has one chord: (2, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
