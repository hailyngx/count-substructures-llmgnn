Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 1, 4, 5, 2, 6, 9> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 1, 3, 5, 2, 9, 6> 
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 4, 9, 6, 8, 7, 2> 
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 9, 6> 
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 9, 4, 5, 3, 1, 7> 
- Cycle 6: <0, 6, 9, 2, 5, 3, 1, 7> 
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 9, 6, 8, 7, 2, 5> 
- Cycle 8: <1, 4, 5, 3, 0, 7, 8, 6> 
- Cycle 9: <1, 7, 8, 6, 9, 4, 5, 3> 
- Cycle 10: <1, 3, 5, 4, 9, 6, 8, 7> 
- Cycle 11: <2, 5, 4, 1, 7, 8, 6, 9> 
- Cycle 12: <2, 5, 3, 0, 7, 8, 6, 9> 
- Cycle 13: <2, 6, 9, 4, 1, 7, 8, 3> 
- Cycle 14: <2, 6, 0, 3, 8, 7, 1, 4> 

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (7, 1) and (4, 2)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (7, 2)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (5, 1)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (8, 3)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 8 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
