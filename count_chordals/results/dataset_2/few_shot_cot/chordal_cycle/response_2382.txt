Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 7, 4, 8, 3, 1, 5>
- <0, 7, 9, 2, 10, 5>
- <0, 11, 1, 5, 10, 14>
- <0, 11, 2, 9, 4, 12>
- <0, 13, 14, 5, 12, 6>
- <1, 11, 2, 9, 4, 12>
- <1, 11, 10, 2, 9, 4>
- <2, 9, 4, 12, 6, 3>
- <2, 9, 4, 12, 5, 10>
- <3, 1, 5, 12, 6, 4>
- <3, 8, 4, 9, 7, 0>
- <4, 8, 3, 6, 12, 9>
- <4, 9, 2, 12, 5, 10>
- <5, 1, 11, 10, 14, 13>
- <5, 10, 14, 13, 0, 7>
  
Step 2: Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- <0, 7, 4, 8, 3, 1, 5> - Chord: (4, 1)
- <0, 7, 9, 2, 10, 5> - Chord: (9, 10)
- <0, 11, 1, 5, 10, 14> - Chord: (1, 10)
- <0, 11, 2, 9, 4, 12> - Chord: (9, 4)
- <0, 13, 14, 5, 12, 6> - Chord: (14, 5)
- <1, 11, 2, 9, 4, 12> - Chord: (11, 2)
- <1, 11, 10, 2, 9, 4> - Chord: (11, 2)
- <2, 9, 4, 12, 6, 3> - Chord: (6, 3)
- <2, 9, 4, 12, 5, 10> - Chord: (9, 12)
- <3, 1, 5, 12, 6, 4> - Chord: (1, 5)
- <3, 8, 4, 9, 7, 0> - Chord: (9, 0)
- <4, 8, 3, 6, 12, 9> - Chord: (3, 6)
- <4, 9, 2, 12, 5, 10> - Chord: (9, 5)
- <5, 1, 11, 10, 14, 13> - Chord: (1, 10)
- <5, 10, 14, 13, 0, 7> - Chord: (10, 0)

<0, 11, 1, 5, (10, 14)>
<0, 11, 2, 9, 4, 12>
<0, 13, 14, 5, (12, 6)>
<1, 11, 2, 9, 4, 12>
<2, 9, 4, 12, (6, 3)>
