Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (7, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 2, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- <5, 9, 7, 9>
- <6, 5, 9, 7>
- <6, 5, 1, 2>
- <6, 5, 8, 1>
- <1, 5, 9, 7>
- <1, 5, 6, 2>
- <1, 5, 8, 2>
- <3, 5, 9, 7>
- <3, 5, 6, 2>
- <3, 5, 1, 4>
- <2, 6, 4, 0>
- <2, 6, 4, 1>
- <2, 6, 4, 3>
- <2, 1, 5, 0>
- <2, 1, 5, 8>
- <8, 5, 1, 0>
- <0, 5, 8, 1>
- <4, 6, 2, 8>
- <4, 6, 2, 1>
- <4, 6, 2, 3>
- <4, 1, 5, 0>
- <4, 1, 5, 8>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
- <2, (1, 4), 3>
- <2, (1, 8), 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we get [2].
