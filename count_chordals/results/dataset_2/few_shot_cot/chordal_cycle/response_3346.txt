Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 4, 2, 9, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 9, 8, 3, 7, 2)
- Cycle 3: (7, 9, 6, 4, 8, 7)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (1, 2)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (2, 3)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (6, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, (1, 2), 6>
<2, (2, 3), 7>
<3, (6, 8), 4>
