Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <0, 1, 6, 7>
        - Cycle 2: <2, 0, 1, 6>
        - Cycle 3: <3, 10, 7, 6>
        - Cycle 4: <4, 12, 11, 1>
        - Cycle 5: <5, 17, 4, 12>
        - Cycle 6: <8, 13, 9, 5>
        - Cycle 7: <14, 15, 2, 0>
        - Cycle 8: <15, 19, 8, 13>
        - Cycle 9: <15, 14, 3, 10>
        - Cycle 10: <17, 5, 9, 13>
        - Cycle 11: <18, 17, 5, 2>
        - Cycle 12: <19, 8, 3, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 1, 6, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - Number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
