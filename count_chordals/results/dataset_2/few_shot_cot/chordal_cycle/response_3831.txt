- Cycle 21: <1, 7, 5, 3>
- Cycle 22: <1, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 23: <1, 7, 6, 4>
- Cycle 24: <1, 7, 0, 4>
- Cycle 25: <2, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 26: <2, 4, 3, 5>

- Cycle 29: <2, 8, 4, 6>
- Cycle 30: <2, 8, 0, 4>
- Cycle 31: <2, 8, 3, 7>
- Cycle 32: <3, 5, 6, 7>
- Cycle 33: <3, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle 34: <3, 5, 6, 4>
- Cycle 35: <3, 5, 4, 8>
- Cycle 36: <3, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 37: <3, 7, 1, 5>
- Cycle 38: <3, 7, 1, 6>
- Cycle 39: <4, 8, 2, 0>
- Cycle 40: <4, 8, 3, 5>
- Cycle 41: <5, 6, 1, 7>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (4, 6), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (4, 8), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (4, 6), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, (4, 8), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, (4, 3), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, (5, 6), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, (5, 3), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, (5, 6), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <1, (5, 3), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <1, (6, 4), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <1, (6, 5), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <2, (4, 6), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <2, (4, 3), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <2, (4, 6), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <2, (4, 0), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <2, (8, 4), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <3, (5, 6), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <3, (5, 7), 0>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 23 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the count of chordless cycles is [23].
