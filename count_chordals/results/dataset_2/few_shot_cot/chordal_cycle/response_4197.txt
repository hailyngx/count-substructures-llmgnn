Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 7) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all edges existing:
1. <0, 2, 9, 5, 8, 3, 7, 0>
2. <0, 2, 9, 5, 8, 1, 7, 0>
3. <1, 2, 9, 5, 8, 3, 7, 1>
4. <3, 5, 9, 4, 6, 4, 2, 1, 8, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1 has chord (2, 8).
- Cycle 2 has chord (2, 8).
- Cycle 3 has chord (2, 8).
- Cycle 4 has chord (9, 8).

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0]. 

Thus, there are no chordless cycles in this graph.
