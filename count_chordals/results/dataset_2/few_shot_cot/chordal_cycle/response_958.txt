- Cycle 6: <0, 5, 1, 6> (length 4)
- Cycle 7: <0, 5, 1, 9> (length 4)
- Cycle 8: <0, 5, 3, 6> (length 4)
- Cycle 9: <1, 6, 4, 8> (length 4)
- Cycle 10: <1, 6, 4, 0> (length 4)
- Cycle 11: <1, 6, 9, 8> (length 4)
- Cycle 12: <1, 6, 9, 3> (length 4)
- Cycle 13: <1, 9, 8, 7> (length 4)
- Cycle 14: <2, 7, 8, 4> (length 4)

- Cycle 18: <3, 6, 4, 8> (length 4)
- Cycle 19: <3, 6, 4, 0> (length 4)
- Cycle 20: <3, 6, 9, 8> (length 4)
- Cycle 21: <3, 9, 8, 7> (length 4)
- Cycle 22: <3, 9, 8, 5> (length 4)
- Cycle 23: <4, 8, 9, 2> (length 4)
- Cycle 24: <4, 8, 5, 0> (length 4)
- Cycle 25: <4, 8, 5, 1> (length 4)
- Cycle 26: <4, 6, 9, 2> (length 4)
- Cycle 27: <4, 6, 9, 3> (length 4)
- Cycle 28: <5, 8, 7, 2> (length 4)
- Cycle 29: <5, 8, 7, 2> (length 4)
- Cycle 30: <5, 1, 6, 3> (length 4)
- Cycle 31: <6, 9, 8, 7> (length 4)

Step 2: Checking for a unique chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 is chordless
- Cycle 2 is chordless
- Cycle 3 is chordless
- Cycle 4 is chordless
- Cycle 5 is chordless
- Cycle 6 is chordless
- Cycle 7 is chordless
- Cycle 8 is chordless
- Cycle 9 is chordless
- Cycle 10 is chordless
- Cycle 11 is chordless
- Cycle 12 is chordless
- Cycle 13 is chordless
- Cycle 14 is chordless
- Cycle 15 is chordless
- Cycle 16 is chordless
- Cycle 17 is chordless
- Cycle 18 is chordless
- Cycle 19 is chordless
- Cycle 20 is chordless
- Cycle 21 is chordless
- Cycle 22 is chordless
- Cycle 23 is chordless
- Cycle 24 is chordless
- Cycle 25 is chordless
- Cycle 26 is chordless
- Cycle 27 is chordless
- Cycle 28 is chordless
- Cycle 29 is chordless
- Cycle 30 is chordless
- Cycle 31 is chordless

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 31 chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count is [31].
