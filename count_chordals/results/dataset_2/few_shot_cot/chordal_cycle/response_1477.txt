Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph (ensuring every edge in the cycle exists):
- Cycle 1: (11, 5, 4, 3, 11)
- Cycle 2: (11, 5, 17, 2, 11)
- Cycle 3: (11, 16, 2, 3, 11)
- Cycle 4: (16, 15, 3, 2, 16)
- Cycle 5: (16, 6, 8, 14, 16)
- Cycle 6: (3, 4, 5, 1, 3)
- Cycle 7: (4, 5, 17, 8, 4)
- Cycle 8: (5, 1, 13, 2, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 17, 7, 19, 5)
- Cycle 10: (13, 2, 16, 11, 13)
- Cycle 11: (8, 14, 19, 7, 8)
- Cycle 12: (19, 7, 17, 5, 19)
- Cycle 13: (6, 16, 11, 12, 6)
- Cycle 14: (6, 15, 3, 2, 6)
- Cycle 15: (6, 8, 14, 19, 6)
- Cycle 16: (0, 19, 7, 17, 0)
- Cycle 17: (0, 10, 8, 6, 0)
- Cycle 18: (0, 9, 18, 9, 0)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (16, 5), 3, 11> has one chord: (16, 5)
- <2, 16, (17, 11), 13> has one chord: (17, 11)
- <16, 2, (15, 6), 11> has one chord: (15, 6)
- <16, (8, 14), 17, 6> has one chord: (8, 14)
- <4, 5, (8, 17), 3> has one chord: (8, 17)
- <5, 17, 7, (19, 14)> has one chord: (19, 14)
- <8, (14, 19), 6, 10> has one chord: (14, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [11]
