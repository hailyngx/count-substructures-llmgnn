Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph without considering chords:
<0, 9, 2, 7>  
<0, 9, 2, 6>  
<0, 9, 2, 1>  
<1, 9, 2, 7>  
<1, 9, 2, 6>  
<1, 9, 3, 5>  
<2, 9, 3, 6>  
<2, 9, 0, 8>  
<4, 5, 6, 7>  
<4, 5, 6, 8>  
<4, 1, 9, 2>  
<4, 1, 2, 7>  
<4, 1, 2, 6>  
<5, 6, 7, 4>  
<5, 6, 7, 2>  
<5, 3, 9, 2>  
<6, 7, 8, 4>  
<6, 7, 8, 2>  
<6, 3, 9, 2>  
<7, 4, 8, 6>  
<7, 4, 1, 9>  
<7, 4, 1, 2>  
<8, 4, 1, 9>  
<8, 4, 7, 6>  
<8, 0, 9, 2>  

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0, 9, 2, 7> (Chord: (0, 2))  
<0, 9, 2, 6> (Chord: (0, 2))  
<0, 9, 2, 1> (Chord: (1, 9))  
<1, 9, 2, 7> (Chord: (1, 9))  
<1, 9, 2, 6> (Chord: (1, 9))  
<1, 9, 3, 5> (Chord: (9, 3))  
<2, 9, 3, 6> (Chord: (2, 3))  
<4, 5, 6, 7> (Chord: (5, 7))  
<4, 5, 6, 8> (Chord: (4, 6))  
<4, 1, 9, 2> (Chord: (1, 9))  
<5, 6, 7, 4> (Chord: (6, 7))  
<5, 6, 7, 2> (Chord: (5, 7))  
<6, 7, 8, 4> (Chord: (6, 8))  
<8, 4, 1, 9> (Chord: (1, 9))  
<8, 4, 7, 6> (Chord: (4, 7))  

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
