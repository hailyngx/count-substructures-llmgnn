Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 4) (8, 10) (8, 0) (8, 3) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 10) (13, 7) (4, 8) (4, 10) (0, 8) (0, 14) (14, 6) (14, 0) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 1) (12, 6) (12, 2) (12, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 14) (1, 10) (2, 5) (2, 12) (2, 11) (11, 13) (11, 14) (11, 2) (11, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 13) (7, 11) (3, 8) (3, 14) (3, 12) (10, 6) (10, 8) (10, 13) (10, 4) (10, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 14
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 14, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 12, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 14, and node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 14, 7, 10, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 13, and node 11
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 4, 10, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 8, 13, 4, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 13, 14, 2, and node 7
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 3
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 11, 10, and node 7
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 0, 11, 3, and node 1

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph are:

<1, 6, 12, 2>, with chord (14, 11)
<1, 10, 4, 8>, with chord (13, 3)
<2, 5, 1, 9>, with chord (6, 7)
<2, 11, 13, 7>, with chord (10, 6)
<4, 10, 13, 8>, with chord (0, 14)

Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles, we get [0].
