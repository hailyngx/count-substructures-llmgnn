Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <6, 9, 4, 5, 6>
- Cycle 2: <6, 9, 4, 7, 6>
- Cycle 3: <6, 7, 4, 9, 6>
- Cycle 4: <4, 9, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle 5: <4, 9, 2, 7, 4>
- Cycle 6: <4, 7, 2, 9, 4>
- Cycle 7: <4, 7, 8, 4>
- Cycle 8: <4, 8, 7, 2, 4>
- Cycle 9: <7, 4, 9, 2, 7>
- Cycle 10: <7, 2, 9, 6, 7>
- Cycle 11: <2, 9, 6, 5, 2>
- Cycle 12: <2, 9, 4, 5, 2>
- Cycle 13: <2, 5, 1, 3, 2>
- Cycle 14: <2, 5, 4, 7, 2>
- Cycle 15: <2, 7, 6, 9, 2>

- Cycle 26: <5, 6, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 27: <5, 4, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle 28: <0, 6, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 29: <0, 6, 9, 4, 0>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, 9, 4, 5, 6> has chord (9, 5) as a chord.
- <4, 9, 3, 1, 4> has chord (9, 1) as a chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [27]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <6, 9, 4, 5, 6>
- <4, 9, 3, 1, 4>
