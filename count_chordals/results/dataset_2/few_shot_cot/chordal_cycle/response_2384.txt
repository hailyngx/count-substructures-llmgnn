Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 5) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 2) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <4, 9, 2, 0> with chord (4, 2)
2. <4, 9, 1, 7> with chord (1, 9)
3. <4, 9, 3, 6> with chord (3, 9)
4. <4, 5, 2, 0> with chord (5, 2)
5. <7, 5, 2, 3> with chord (2, 5)
6. <7, 5, 8, 0> with chord (8, 5)
7. <7, 1, 6, 3> with chord (6, 1)
8. <6, 3, 9, 1> with chord (9, 3)
9. <6, 1, 7, 8> with chord (7, 1)
10. <9, 2, 0, 4> with chord (0, 2)
11. <9, 3, 8, 7> with chord (8, 3)
12. <2, 5, 8, 7> with chord (8, 5)
13. <2, 5, 4, 9> with chord (4, 5)
14. <2, 0, 4, 9> with chord (4, 2)
15. <3, 6, 7, 1> with chord (7, 6)
16. <3, 9, 4, 5> with chord (4, 9)
17. <3, 8, 5, 2> with chord (5, 8)

Step 2: 
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <4, 9, 2, 0> with chord (4, 2)
2. <4, 9, 1, 7> with chord (1, 9)
3. <4, 9, 3, 6> with chord (3, 9)
4. <4, 5, 2, 0> with chord (5, 2)
5. <7, 5, 2, 3> with chord (2, 5)
6. <7, 5, 8, 0> with chord (8, 5)
7. <6, 1, 7, 8> with chord (7, 1)
8. <9, 2, 0, 4> with chord (0, 2)
9. <2, 5, 8, 7> with chord (8, 5)
10. <2, 5, 4, 9> with chord (4, 5)
11. <3, 6, 7, 1> with chord (7, 6)
12. <3, 9, 4, 5> with chord (4, 9)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles = [12]
