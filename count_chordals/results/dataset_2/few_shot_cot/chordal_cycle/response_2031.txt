Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <1, 9, 5, 4, 1> (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 2: <2, 4, 5, 8, 2> (chordless cycle)
- Cycle 3: <2, 4, 1, 7, 2> (1-7 is a chord)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, 9, 5, 4, 1> is a chordless cycle
- <2, 4, 5, 8, 2> is a chordless cycle
- <2, 4, 1, 7, 2> has one chord (1-7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:
There are 2 chordless cycles found: <1, 9, 5, 4, 1> and <2, 4, 5, 8, 2>, so the final count is [2].
