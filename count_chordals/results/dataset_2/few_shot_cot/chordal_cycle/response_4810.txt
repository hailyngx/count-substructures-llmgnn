Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 2, 18, 9) (length 4)
- Cycle 2: (0, 2, 4, 10) (length 4)
- Cycle 3: (0, 4, 10, 15) (length 4)
- Cycle 4: (0, 14, 7, 11) (length 4)
- Cycle 5: (2, 9, 17, 8) (length 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 10, 11, 8) (length 4)
- Cycle 7: (14, 7, 16, 12) (length 4)
- Cycle 8: (14, 15, 13, 8) (length 4)
- Cycle 9: (19, 3, 14, 0) (length 4)
- Cycle 10: (19, 12, 16, 7) (length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, (2, 18), 9>: Chord (2, 18)
- <0, (2, 4), 10>: Chord (2, 4)
- <0, (4, 10), 15>: Chord (4, 10)
- <0, (7, 14), 11>: Chord (7, 14)
- <2, (9, 17), 8>: Chord (9, 17)
- <4, (10, 11), 8>: Chord (10, 11)
- <7, (11, 16), 14>: Chord (11, 16)
- <8, (13, 15), 14>: Chord (13, 15)
- <14, (0, 3), 19>: Chord (0, 3)
- <14, (7, 16), 12>: Chord (7, 16)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
We found 0 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
