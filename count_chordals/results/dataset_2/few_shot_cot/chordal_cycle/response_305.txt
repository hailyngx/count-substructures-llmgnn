Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
        <0, 5, 9, 6>
        <0, 5, 2, 7>
        <0, 1, 7, 4>
        <0, 1, 6, 3>
        <5, 9, 6, 1>
        <5, 9, 3, 7>
        <5, 2, 7, 1>
        <9, 6, 4, 7>
        <9, 6, 3, 1>
        <9, 3, 7, 0>
        <9, 3, 1, 6>
        <2, 7, 0, 5>
        <2, 7, 1, 6>
        <7, 4, 6, 9>
        <7, 4, 3, 1>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        <0, 5, 9, 6> has a unique chord (5, 6)  
        <0, 1, 7, 4> has a unique chord (1, 4)  
        <5, 9, 6, 1> has a unique chord (9, 1)  
        <5, 2, 7, 1> has a unique chord (2, 7)  
        <9, 6, 4, 7> has a unique chord (6, 7)

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: [5]
