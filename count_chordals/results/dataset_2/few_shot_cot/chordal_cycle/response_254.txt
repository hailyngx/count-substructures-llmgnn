6. Cycle: 0-14-2-12-11-1-0
7. Cycle: 0-14-5-7-4-0
8. Cycle: 0-14-5-6-9-4-0
9. Cycle: 0-14-5-7-2-12-4-0
10. Cycle: 1-10-8-0-14-2-7-4-1

23. Cycle: 5-7-2-9-3-8-0-14-1-5
24. Cycle: 5-14-1-10-8-0-6-9-5
25. Cycle: 5-14-2-12-11-1-10-8-5

Step 2:
Let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. <0, 8, 10, 1, 0> - No chord 
2. <0, 8, 3, 5, 0> - No chord 
3. <0, 14, 1, 10, 8, 0> - Chord: (1, 10)
4. <0, 14, 1, 11, 12, 4, 0> - No chord 
5. <0, 14, 2, 7, 4, 0> - No chord 
6. <0, 14, 2, 12, 11, 1, 0> - Chord: (2, 1)
7. <0, 14, 5, 7, 4, 0> - No chord 
8. <0, 14, 5, 6, 9, 4, 0> - No chord 
9. <0, 14, 5, 7, 2, 12, 4, 0> - Chord: (5, 2)
10. <1, 10, 8, 0, 14, 2, 7, 4, 1> - Chord: (1, 4)
11. <1, 10, 13, 12, 11, 1> - No chord 
12. <1, 14, 2, 7, 4, 12, 11, 1> - No chord 
13. <2, 9, 6, 5, 7, 4, 12, 2> - No chord 
14. <2, 9, 6, 5, 14, 0, 8, 10, 2> - No chord 
15. <2, 9, 3, 5, 14, 0, 8, 10, 2> - No chord 
16. <2, 12, 11, 1, 14, 0, 8, 3, 2> - Chord: (2, 3)
17. <3, 9, 4, 7, 5, 3> - No chord
18. <3, 9, 4, 12, 11, 1, 3> - No chord 
19. <3, 9, 6, 5, 14, 1, 11, 3> - No chord
20. <4, 12, 11, 1, 10, 8, 3, 5, 4> - No chord
21. <5, 6, 9, 4, 7, 2, 14, 0, 5> - No chord
22. <5, 6, 9, 3, 8, 0, 14, 2, 7, 5> - No chord
23. <5, 7, 2, 9, 3, 8, 0, 14, 1, 5> - Chord: (5, 1)
24. <5, 14, 1, 10, 8, 0, 6, 9, 5> - Chord: (5, 10)
25. <5, 14, 2, 12, 11, 1, 10, 8, 5> - Chord: (5, 1)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles = [4]
