Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle <5, 9, 2, 4>
- Cycle <5, 4, 0, 7>
- Cycle <5, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle <5, 8, 1, 7>
- Cycle <5, 8, 2, 9>
- Cycle <4, 2, 8, 1>
- Cycle <4, 3, 7, 1>
- Cycle <4, 3, 6, 5>
- Cycle <2, 3, 7, 1>
- Cycle <2, 8, 7, 1>

Step 2: The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 9, 2, 4> with chord (2, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 8, 1, 7> with chord (1, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [8].
