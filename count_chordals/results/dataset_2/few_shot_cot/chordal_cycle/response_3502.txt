Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
<0, 7, 2, 18> with chord (7, 18)
<1, 14, 17, 29> with chord (14, 17)
<2, 7, 0, 27> with chord (7, 27)
<4, 12, 27, 6> with chord (12, 6)
<4, 11, 26, 24> with chord (11, 24)
<5, 12, 27, 6> with chord (12, 6)
<5, 6, 27, 0> with chord (6, 27)
<10, 0, 7, 27> with chord (0, 27)
<13, 16, 5, 2> with chord (16, 2)
<14, 17, 29, 15> with chord (17, 29)
