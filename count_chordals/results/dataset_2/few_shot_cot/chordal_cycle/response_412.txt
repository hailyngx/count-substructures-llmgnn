Response:
Step 1: 
Potential cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 2, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 4, 6, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 4, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 6, 7, 4, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 3, 9, 4, 6, 7, 2>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the potential cycles:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has chord (3, 4).
- Cycle 4 has chord (3, 7).
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has chord (5, 3).
- Cycle 7 has no chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [3].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, 3, 4, 6, 5, 0> (Chord: (3, 4))
- <0, 3, 4, 7, 2, 0> (Chord: (3, 7))
- <1, 5, 6, 7, 4, 9, 3, 1> (Chord: (5, 3))
