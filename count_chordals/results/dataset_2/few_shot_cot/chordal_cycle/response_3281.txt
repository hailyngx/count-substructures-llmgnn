Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 4, 10, 8, 1>
- <0, 4, 14, 12, 1>
- <0, 1, 8, 9, 13, 5>
- <1, 8, 9, 6, 3, 7>
- <1, 4, 12, 14, 11, 5>
- <2, 8, 1, 4, 10, 11>
- <3, 6, 5, 13, 9, 8>
- <4, 12, 14, 11, 10, 8>
- <4, 10, 11, 5, 13, 9>
- <5, 11, 2, 8, 1, 0>
- <6, 9, 13, 5, 11, 2>
- <7, 3, 6, 5, 13, 9>
- <8, 10, 4, 12, 14, 11>
- <9, 13, 5, 11, 14, 12>
- <10, 4, 0, 1, 8, 2>
- <11, 14, 12, 4, 0, 1>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 4, 12, 14> (Chord: (1, 12))
- <2, 8, 1, 0, 5> (Chord: (2, 5))
- <4, 12, 14, 11, 10> (Chord: (4, 11))

Step 3:
