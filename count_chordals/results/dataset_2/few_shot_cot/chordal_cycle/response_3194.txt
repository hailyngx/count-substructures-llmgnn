Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (3, 4, 5, 6, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 4, 7, 9, 3)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 6, 7, 0)
- Cycle 4: (6, 7, 9, 5, 6)
- Cycle 5: (0, 6, 5, 8, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 1, 7, 4, 0)
- Cycle 7: (3, 9, 8, 5, 3)
- Cycle 8: (3, 7, 1, 6, 3)
- Cycle 9: (4, 7, 3, 6, 4)
- Cycle 10: (2, 4, 7, 9, 2)
- Cycle 11: (2, 4, 5, 8, 2)
- Cycle 12: (4, 5, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 7, 9, 5, 4)
- Cycle 14: (6, 5, 9, 7, 6)

Step 2:
The cycles which have exactly one chord are:
- <1, (6, 4), 7> (Cycle 1)
- <2, (4, 8), 5> (Cycle 11)
- <3, (7, 9), 4> (Cycle 9)
- <4, (5, 1), 6> (Cycle 12)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found gives [10]
