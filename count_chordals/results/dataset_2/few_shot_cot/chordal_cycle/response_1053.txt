Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (11, 1) (11, 18) (16, 11) (16, 17) (3, 15) (3, 0) (3, 6) (15, 3) (15, 19) (15, 17) (15, 2) (4, 7) (4, 13) (7, 4) (7, 2) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 12) (9, 6) (9, 13) (18, 11) (18, 19) (18, 17) (18, 13) (2, 15) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 13) (8, 2) (8, 14) (5, 12) (5, 14) (13, 4) (13, 9) (13, 18) (13, 2) (1, 11) (1, 17) (17, 16) (17, 15) (17, 18) (17, 1) (17, 0) (19, 15) (19, 18) (19, 0) (0, 3) (0, 17) (0, 19) (0, 12) (14, 8) (14, 5) (12, 6) (12, 5) (12, 0) (12, 10) (10, 12)

Node 18 is connected to node 11, 19, 17, and node 13
Node 19 is connected to node 15, 18, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 15, 17, 16> (length 5)
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 15, 2, 7> (length 5)
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 6, 2, 15> (length 5)
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 6, 12, 5> (length 5)
- Cycle 5: <0, 3, 6, 12, 10> (length 5)
- Cycle 6: <0, 17, 16, 11, 18> (length 5)
- Cycle 7: <0, 17, 16, 11, 1> (length 5)
- Cycle 8: <0, 17, 1, 11, 18> (length 5)
- Cycle 9: <0, 19, 15, 3, 6> (length 5)
- Cycle 10: <0, 19, 15, 2, 7> (length 5)
- Cycle 11: <0, 19, 18, 11, 16> (length 5)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <0, 3, 15, 17, 16> has exactly one chord <15, 17>.
- <0, 3, 15, 2, 7> has exactly one chord <15, 2>.
- <0, 17, 16, 11, 18> has exactly one chord <16, 11>.
- <0, 17, 1, 11, 18> has exactly one chord <1, 18>.
- <0, 19, 18, 11, 16> has exactly one chord <18, 11>.
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 7 chordless cycles found.
