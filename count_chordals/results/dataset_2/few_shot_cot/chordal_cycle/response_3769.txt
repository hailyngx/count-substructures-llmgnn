Response:
To count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, we can follow the steps provided in the initial prompt:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- From the given graph, we identify the following cycles of length 4:
1. <0, 17, 0, 16>
2. <0, 17, 0, 15>
3. <0, 16, 0, 15>
4. <0, 16, 0, 12>
5. <0, 16, 5, 2>
6. <0, 12, 0, 14>
7. <0, 12, 0, 11>
8. <0, 12, 11, 8>
9. <0, 15, 0, 19>
10. <0, 15, 0, 13>
11. <0, 15, 13, 14>
12. <0, 19, 0, 16>
13. <0, 19, 1, 19>
14. <0, 19, 1, 18>
15. <0, 19, 15, 13>
16. <2, 9, 8, 16>
17. <2, 9, 8, 11>
18. <2, 9, 11, 12>
19. <2, 9, 11, 7>
20. <2, 11, 7, 14>
21. <2, 11, 8, 16>
22. <2, 11, 8, 9>
23. <2, 11, 12, 14>
24. <2, 5, 16, 10>
25. <2, 5, 16, 8>
26. <2, 6, 18, 4>
27. <2, 6, 18, 7>
28. <2, 6, 18, 19>
29. <3, 14, 12, 11>
30. <3, 14, 12, 0>
31. <3, 14, 12, 14>
32. <3, 14, 7, 18>
33. <3, 14, 7, 11>
34. <3, 13, 14, 12>
35. <3, 13, 14, 7>
36. <3, 13, 15, 0>
37. <3, 13, 15, 19>
38. <4, 18, 7, 14>
39. <4, 18, 7, 11>
40. <4, 18, 6, 2>
41. <4, 18, 6, 18>
42. <4, 10, 16, 5>
43. <4, 10, 16, 8>
44. <4, 13, 15, 19>
45. <4, 13, 15, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- After examining each of the cycles listed above, we find that the following 4-cycles have exactly one chord:
1. <0, 17, 0, 16> (Chord: (0, 16))
2. <0, 16, 0, 15> (Chord: (0, 15))
3. <0, 12, 0, 14> (Chord: (0, 14))
4. <0, 19, 0, 15> (Chord: (0, 15))
5. <0, 19, 15, 13> (Chord: (15, 13))
6. <2, 9, 8, 11> (Chord: (8, 11))
7. <2, 9, 11, 12> (Chord: (11, 12))
8. <2, 6, 18, 7> (Chord: (18, 7))
9. <3, 14, 12, 0> (Chord: (12, 0))
10. <3, 13, 15, 0> (Chord: (15, 0))
11. <4, 10, 16, 5> (Chord: (16, 5))
12. <4, 13, 15, 19> (Chord: (15, 19))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- From the above list, we have found 12 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the count is [12].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <0, 17, 0, 16> (Chord: (0, 16))
2. <0, 16, 0, 15> (Chord: (0, 15))
3. <0, 12, 0, 14> (Chord: (0, 14))
4. <0, 19, 0, 15> (Chord: (0, 15))
5. <0, 19, 15, 13> (Chord: (15, 13))
6. <2, 9, 8, 11> (Chord: (8, 11))
7. <2, 9, 11, 12> (Chord: (11, 12))
8. <2, 6, 18, 7> (Chord: (18, 7))
9. <3, 14, 12, 0> (Chord: (12, 0))
10. <3, 13, 15, 0> (Chord: (15, 0))
11. <4, 10, 16, 5> (Chord: (16, 5))
12. <4, 13, 15, 19> (Chord: (15, 19))
