Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles: 
- Cycle 1: (0, 6, 5, 3, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 6, 5, 2, 4, 9, 7, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 8, 9, 7, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 7, 9, 8, 6, 0)
- Cycle 5: (1, 7, 9, 8, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 0, 6, 8, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 5, 4, 9, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 5, 6, 3, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 5, 6, 8, 7, 3, 2)
- Cycle 10: (3, 5, 6, 8, 7, 3)
- Cycle 11: (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 5, 2, 3, 4)
- Cycle 13: (7, 9, 8, 6, 5, 3, 7)
- Cycle 14: (9, 6, 8, 7, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, (6, 3), 5, 0>
- <0, (6, 5), 9, 7, 0>
- <0, (6, 8), 7, 9, 0>
- <0, (7, 9), 8, 6, 0>
- <1, (7, 8), 9, 1>
- <1, (0, 8), 6, 1>
- <2, (5, 4), 9, 2>
- <2, (5, 6), 3, 2>
- <2, (5, 8), 7, 3, 2>
- <3, (5, 6), 8, 7, 3>
- <4, (5, 6), 8, 9, 4>
- <4, (2, 5), 3, 4>
- <7, (9, 8), 6, 5, 3, 7>
- <9, (6, 8), 7, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 14 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [14].
