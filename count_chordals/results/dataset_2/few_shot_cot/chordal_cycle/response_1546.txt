- Cycle 7: <0, 5, 14, 9, 13, 0>
- Cycle 8: <1, 3, 2, 14, 9, 13, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 3, 0, 5, 14, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 7, 12, 11, 10, 1>

- Cycle 13: <1, 14, 5, 6, 10, 13, 1>
- Cycle 14: <2, 3, 1, 14, 9, 13, 2>
- Cycle 15: <2, 11, 10, 0, 3, 2>

- Cycle 19: <4, 6, 5, 14, 9, 13, 4>
- Cycle 20: <4, 13, 9, 14, 5, 6, 4>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycles with one chord (chordal 4-cycles):
  - Chordal cycle 1: <0, 1, (3, 2), 0>
  - Chordal cycle 2: <0, 1, (7, 8), 0>
  - Chordal cycle 3: <0, 1, (14, 13), 9, 0>
  - Chordal cycle 4: <0, 1, (14, 5), 0>
  - Chordal cycle 5: <0, 3, (2, 11), 10, 0>
  - Chordal cycle 6: <0, 5, (6, 10), 0>
  - Chordal cycle 7: <0, 5, (14, 9), 13, 0>
  - Chordal cycle 8: <1, 3, (2, 14), 9, 1>
  - Chordal cycle 9: <1, 3, (0, 5), 14, 1>
  - Chordal cycle 10: <1, 7, (12, 11), 10, 1>
  - Chordal cycle 11: <1, 7, (8, 6), 10, 1>
  - Chordal cycle 12: <1, 7, (8, 12), 0, 1>
  - Chordal cycle 13: <1, 14, (5, 6), 10, 13, 1>
  - Chordal cycle 14: <2, 3, (1, 14), 9, 13, 2>
  - Chordal cycle 15: <2, 11, (10, 0), 3, 2>
  - Chordal cycle 16: <2, 11, (12, 7), 1, 3, 2>
  - Chordal cycle 17: <2, 13, (9, 14), 1, 3, 2>
  - Chordal cycle 18: <2, 13, (6, 5), 14, 2>
  - Chordal cycle 19: <4, 6, (5, 14), 9, 13, 4>
  - Chordal cycle 20: <4, 13, (9, 14), 5, 6, 4>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Final count: [20]
