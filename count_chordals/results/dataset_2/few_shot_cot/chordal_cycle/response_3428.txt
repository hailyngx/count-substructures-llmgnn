Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 11) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (9, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 14) (8, 6) (8, 3) (13, 5) (13, 14) (13, 0) (7, 9) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 1) (12, 7) (12, 10) (12, 0) (12, 11) (3, 8) (3, 11) (11, 5) (11, 12) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 1) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 7) (0, 12) (0, 10) (0, 6) (4, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 6) (10, 1) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (1, 7) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 10) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 13, 7, 12, 10, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 11, 10, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 8, and node 11
Node 4 is connected to node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, 8, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 7, 0, 10, 14, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 12, 0, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 14, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 12, 0, 6, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 12, 3, 14, and node 1
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 10, 0, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 14, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 8, 13, 11, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. Cycle <9, 8, 5, 13> with chord (8, 13)
2. Cycle <9, 7, 12, 10> with chord (7, 10)
3. Cycle <8, 13, 5, 9> with chord (13, 9)
4. Cycle <8, 3, 11, 14> with chord (3, 14)
5. Cycle <8, 6, 2, 4> with chord (6, 2)
6. Cycle <13, 14, 8, 5> with chord (14, 5)
7. Cycle <7, 12, 0, 9> with chord (12, 9)
8. Cycle <7, 6, 2, 1> with chord (6, 1)
9. Cycle <12, 0, 10, 1> with chord (0, 1)
10. Cycle <3, 11, 5, 9> with chord (11, 9)

Step 2:
Only cycles 1, 3, 6, and 8 have exactly one chord. The chordal 4-cycles are as follows:
<9, (8, 13), 5, 13>
<13, (9, 5), 8, 5>
<8, (13, 5), 9, 5>
<7, (6, 1), 12, 10>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 0. 

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
