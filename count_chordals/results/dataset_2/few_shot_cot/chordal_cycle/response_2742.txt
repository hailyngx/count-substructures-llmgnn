Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 3) (2, 8) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 2, 3, 6>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 4, 7, 6>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 1, 7, 6>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 3, 6, 5>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 0, 7, 6>
- Cycle 6: <2, 3, 6, 5, 7>
- Cycle 7: <3, 6, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle 8: <3, 6, 9, 1, 7>
- Cycle 9: <4, 6, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle 10: <4, 6, 9, 3, 5>
- Cycle 11: <5, 6, 9, 0, 7>
- Cycle 12: <5, 7, 4, 6, 9>
- Cycle 13: <6, 7, 0, 5, 3>
- Cycle 14: <6, 7, 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle 15: <7, 0, 8, 4, 6>
- Cycle 16: <7, 1, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle 17: <8, 0, 5, 6, 3>
- Cycle 18: <8, 4, 6, 5, 0>
- Cycle 19: <9, 0, 8, 4, 7>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 8, 2, 3, 6> (Chord: (8, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 9, 1, 7, 6> (Chord: (9, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, 6, 5, 7, 4> (Chord: (6, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 6, 5, 7, 0> (Chord: (6, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <7, 1, 9, 6, 5> (Chord: (1, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <8, 0, 5, 6, 3> (Chord: (0, 9))

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the number of chordless cycles is [13].
