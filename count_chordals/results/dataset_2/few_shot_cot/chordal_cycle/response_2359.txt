Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (5, 13, 15, 6) is a cycle
- (8, 16, 6, 9) is a cycle
- (8, 0, 7, 5) is a cycle
- (8, 9, 6, 10) is a cycle
- (9, 15, 13, 14) is a cycle
- (10, 6, 15, 4) is a cycle
- (10, 18, 1, 14) is a cycle
- (13, 5, 7, 17) is a cycle
- (13, 15, 6, 16) is a cycle
- (14, 18, 10, 4) is a cycle

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 13, 15, 6> (Chord: (13, 15))
- <8, 16, 6, 9> (Chord: (8, 9))
- <8, 0, 7, 5> (Chord: (0, 7))
- <8, 9, 6, 10> (Chord: (9, 10))
- <9, 15, 13, 14> (Chord: (13, 14))
- <10, 6, 15, 4> (Chord: (6, 4))
- <10, 18, 1, 14> (Chord: (18, 1))
- <13, 5, 7, 17> (Chord: (5, 17))
- <13, 15, 6, 16> (Chord: (15, 6))
- <14, 18, 10, 4> (Chord: (18, 10))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [0].
