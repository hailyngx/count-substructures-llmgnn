Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (0, 8, 13, 7, 0)
- Cycle 2: (2, 1, 15, 13, 2)
- Cycle 3: (2, 1, 15, 11, 16, 9, 6, 5, 14, 11, 2)
- Cycle 4: (4, 8, 13, 15, 2, 6, 5, 18, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 8, 10, 9, 14, 5, 6, 2, 3, 7, 0, 8, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 12, 17, 12, 18, 19, 3, 7, 13, 8, 4)
- Cycle 7: (5, 18, 19, 3, 7, 0, 8, 10, 4, 12, 17, 12, 18, 5)
- Cycle 8: (8, 13, 15, 1, 2, 6, 5, 18, 19, 3, 7, 13)

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <4, (5, 18), 12, 17>

Step 3:
Finally, the number of chordless 4-cycles found is [7].
