Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 11, 14>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 3, 5>
- Cycle 3: <0, 10, 2, 6>
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, 3, 12>
- Cycle 5: <1, 2, 10, 14>
- Cycle 6: <2, 3, 4, 11>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 14, 10>
- Cycle 8: <3, 4, 11, 14>
- Cycle 9: <5, 3, 4, 11>
- Cycle 10: <5, 7, 12, 6>
- Cycle 11: <7, 12, 1, 2>
- Cycle 12: <9, 6, 12, 1>
- Cycle 13: <9, 6, 2, 10>
- Cycle 14: <9, 11, 4, 0>
- Cycle 15: <11, 4, 0, 10>
- Cycle 16: <13, 0, 10, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, 4, 3, 5> has 1 chord: (3, 5)
- <0, 10, 2, 6> has 1 chord: (0, 2)
- <1, 2, 3, 12> has 1 chord: (2, 12)
- <1, 2, 10, 14> has 1 chord: (10, 14)
- <2, 3, 4, 11> has 1 chord: (3, 11)
- <2, 6, 14, 10> has 1 chord: (6, 10)
- <3, 4, 11, 14> has 1 chord: (4, 14)
- <9, 6, 2, 10> has 1 chord: (6, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 8.

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
