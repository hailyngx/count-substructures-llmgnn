Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 19, 16>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 18, 15>
- Cycle 3: <0, 12, 5, 19>
- Cycle 4: <0, 14, 2, 7>
- Cycle 5: <0, 18, 9, 5>
- Cycle 6: <1, 19, 5, 8>
- Cycle 7: <3, 0, 12, 5>
- Cycle 8: <3, 18, 9, 8>
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 2, 14>
- Cycle 10: <4, 13, 14, 2>
- Cycle 11: <5, 8, 10, 16>
- Cycle 12: <5, 9, 18, 15>
- Cycle 13: <6, 7, 11, 16>
- Cycle 14: <6, 17, 15, 18>
- Cycle 15: <7, 11, 16, 10>
- Cycle 16: <7, 2, 14, 13>
- Cycle 17: <8, 5, 12, 0>
- Cycle 18: <8, 9, 18, 15>
- Cycle 19: <9, 5, 19, 16>
- Cycle 20: <10, 16, 11, 7>
- Cycle 21: <13, 4, 7, 2>
- Cycle 22: <13, 14, 0, 1>
- Cycle 23: <13, 15, 17, 6>
- Cycle 24: <14, 0, 3, 18>
- Cycle 25: <14, 2, 7, 6>
- Cycle 26: <15, 17, 6, 7>
- Cycle 27: <15, 18, 0, 1>
- Cycle 28: <16, 11, 7, 4>
- Cycle 29: <17, 6, 7, 2>
- Cycle 30: <19, 16, 10, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 <0, 3, 18, 15> has a chord (3, 15)
- Cycle 6 <1, 19, 5, 8> has a chord (19, 8)
- Cycle 11 <5, 8, 10, 16> has a chord (8, 16)
- Cycle 13 <6, 7, 11, 16> has a chord (7, 11)
- Cycle 18 <8, 9, 18, 15> has a chord (9, 15)
- Cycle 26 <15, 17, 6, 7> has a chord (17, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [6].
