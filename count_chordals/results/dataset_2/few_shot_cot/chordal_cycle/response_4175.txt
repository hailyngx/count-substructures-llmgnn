Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (0, 7, 5, 14, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 12, 6, 1, 14, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 7, 2, 6, 1, 14, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 3, 8, 13, 5, 14, 0)
- Cycle 5: (1, 10, 11, 0, 7, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 10, 11, 2, 6, 1)
- Cycle 7: (3, 7, 2, 6, 12, 0, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Chordal cycle 1: <0, (5, 14), 7>
- Chordal cycle 2: <0, (6, 1), 12>
- Chordal cycle 3: <0, (2, 6), 7>
- Chordal cycle 4: <0, (8, 13), 3>
- Chordal cycle 5: <1, (11, 0), 7>
- Chordal cycle 6: <1, (11, 2), 10>
- Chordal cycle 7: <3, (2, 6), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
