Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 9, 11, 4> (Chord: (9, 4))
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 1, 5, 13> (Chord: (1, 13))
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 5, 9, 11> (Chord: (5, 11))
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 11, 4, 8> (Chord: (11, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, 7, 11, 9> (Chord: (7, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <4, 8, 9, 5> (Chord: (8, 5))
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, 12, 0, 9> (Chord: (12, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <8, 9, 0, 12> (Chord: (9, 12))
