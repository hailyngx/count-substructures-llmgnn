Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 4, 7, 1>
2. <0, 4, 5, 1>
3. <0, 4, 5, 9>
4. <0, 4, 2, 9>
5. <0, 4, 8, 5>
6. <0, 4, 8, 6>
7. <1, 5, 9, 6>
8. <1, 5, 8, 6>
9. <1, 5, 8, 4>
10. <2, 9, 5, 8>
11. <2, 9, 5, 1>
12. <2, 9, 6, 7>
13. <3, 0, 4, 8>
14. <3, 0, 4, 5>
15. <4, 5, 8, 1>
16. <4, 5, 9, 6>
17. <4, 5, 1, 7>
18. <4, 7, 6, 9>
19. <4, 7, 1, 5>
20. <4, 7, 2, 9>
21. <5, 9, 2, 4>
22. <5, 9, 6, 8>
23. <6, 9, 2, 7>
24. <6, 9, 5, 8>
25. <7, 1, 5, 9>
26. <7, 1, 8, 6>

Step 2:
Unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
1. <0, 4, 7, 1> (0, 7)
2. <0, 4, 5, 9> (4, 9)
3. <0, 4, 8, 5> (4, 8)
4. <0, 4, 8, 6> (4, 8)
5. <2, 9, 5, 8> (9, 5)
6. <2, 9, 6, 7> (9, 6)
7. <4, 5, 1, 7> (5, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 26 total cycles and 7 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
