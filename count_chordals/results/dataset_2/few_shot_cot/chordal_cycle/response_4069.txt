Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 3, 7, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 11, 10, 4, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 13, 9, 4, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 7, 3, 8, 10, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 5, 7, 12, 0, 10, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 5, 2, 7, 3, 6, 1)
- Cycle 7: (1, 5, 2, 9, 12, 0, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 4, 10, 8, 3, 6, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 4, 2, 5, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 4, 9, 13, 11, 6, 1)
- Cycle 11: (3, 7, 12, 0, 10, 8, 3)
- Cycle 12: (3, 7, 5, 2, 9, 12, 3)
- Cycle 13: (3, 6, 13, 9, 12, 7, 3)
- Cycle 14: (3, 8, 10, 9, 13, 6, 3)
- Cycle 15: (10, 11, 6, 13, 9, 12, 10)
- Cycle 16: (10, 11, 14, 13, 9, 12, 10)

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
<1, (2, 9), 4>
<1, (3, 6), 11>
<1, (6, 13), 9>
<3, (7, 12), 0>
<3, (5, 2), 7>
<3, (8, 13), 10>
<10, (11, 14), 13>

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [7]
