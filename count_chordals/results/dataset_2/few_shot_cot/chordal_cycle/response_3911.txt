Step 2: Checking for chord (non-adjacent edge) in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1:  <0, 4, 6, 9>, chord: (0, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 1, 5, 9>, chord: (1, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 2, 5, 9>, chord: (2, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 3, 5, 9>, chord: (3, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]
