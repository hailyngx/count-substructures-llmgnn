Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 13) (9, 11) (9, 1) (8, 13) (8, 12) (8, 7) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 12) (13, 11) (13, 1) (7, 8) (7, 12) (7, 3) (7, 1) (12, 8) (12, 13) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 10) (12, 14) (3, 7) (3, 11) (3, 14) (11, 9) (11, 13) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 0) (4, 6) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 14) (14, 12) (14, 3) (14, 11) (14, 4) (14, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (5, 4) (5, 14) (5, 1) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (10, 12) (0, 6) (0, 11) (0, 2) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 11, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 13, 7, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 11, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 12, 2, 5, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 14, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 4, 0, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 12, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 13, 12, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 11, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 13, 3, 14, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 13, 7, 4, 10, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 8, 12, 11, and node 1
Node 14 is connected to node 12, 3, 11, 4, and node 5

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, 6, 13, 1>. There is exactly one chord (6, 1) in this cycle.

Therefore, the total number of chordless cycles is [0].
