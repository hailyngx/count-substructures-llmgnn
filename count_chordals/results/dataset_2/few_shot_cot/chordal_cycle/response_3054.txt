Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The cycles with exactly one chord are as follows:
  - <1, (7, 16), 9>
  - <1, (7, 16), 11>
  - <1, (7, 16), 9>
  - <1, (7, 16), 11>
  - <3, (11, 16), 15>
  - <3, (11, 16), 7>
  - <3, (11, 16), 7>
  - <3, (11, 16), 15>
  - <3, (11, 16), 7>
  - <3, (11, 16), 7>
  - <3, (11, 16), 15>
  - <4, (2, 6), 10>
  - <4, (2, 10), 8>
  - <5, (0, 15), 16>
  - <5, (0, 15), 16>
  - <12, (14, 18), 19>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, therefore [15].
