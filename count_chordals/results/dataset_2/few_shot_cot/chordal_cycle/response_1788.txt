Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 10) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 11) (9, 3) (9, 13) (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 3) (6, 13) (8, 13) (8, 11) (8, 3) (8, 1) (13, 9) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 14) (4, 12) (4, 2) (4, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 11) (7, 14) (12, 4) (12, 2) (12, 10) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 12) (2, 10) (11, 9) (11, 8) (11, 7) (11, 14) (11, 1) (14, 6) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 1) (1, 8) (1, 4) (1, 11) (1, 14) (10, 5) (10, 12) (10, 2) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 8 is connected to node 13, 11, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 11, 3, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 12, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 8, 7, 14, and node 1
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 6, 13, 7, 11, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - <0, 5, 10, 2>
        - <0, 5, 7, 14>
        - <2, 4, 12, 10>
        - <9, 6, 13, 14>
        - <9, 7, 11, 1>
        - <9, 13, 8, 3>
        - <11, 14, 7, 0>
        - <11, 1, 4, 12>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - <0, 5, 10, 2> has chord (5, 10)
        - <0, 5, 7, 14> has chord (5, 14)
        - <2, 4, 12, 10> has chord (4, 10)
        - <9, 6, 13, 14> has chord (6, 14)
        - <9, 7, 11, 1> has chord (7, 1)
        - <9, 13, 8, 3> has chord (8, 13)
        - <11, 14, 7, 0> has chord (14, 0)
        - <11, 1, 4, 12> has chord (1, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph, so the count is [0].
