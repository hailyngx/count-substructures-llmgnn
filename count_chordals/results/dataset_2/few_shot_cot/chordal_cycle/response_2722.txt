Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle
- <0, 17, 25, 20> has chord (17, 20)
- <7, 9, 22, 11> has chord (9, 11)
- <16, 23, 27, 19> has chord (23, 19)
- <12, 19, 27, 23> has chord (19, 27)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found
There are 44 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [44].
