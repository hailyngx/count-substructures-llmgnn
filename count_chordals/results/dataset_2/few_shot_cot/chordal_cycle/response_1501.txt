Response:
Step 1: 
We identify the cycles in the graph that have a length of 4 or more and where every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (0, 7, 8, 6) with edges (0, 7), (7, 8), (8, 6), and (6, 0).
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 8, 6) with edges (5, 7), (7, 8), (8, 6), and (6, 5).
- Cycle 3: (6, 8, 9, 4) with edges (6, 8), (8, 9), (9, 4), and (4, 6).
- Cycle 4: (11, 6, 8, 9) with edges (11, 6), (6, 8), (8, 9), and (9, 11).
- Cycle 5: (11, 4, 9, 8) with edges (11, 4), (4, 9), (9, 8), and (8, 11).
- Cycle 6: (12, 7, 8, 6) with edges (12, 7), (7, 8), (8, 6), and (6, 12).
- Cycle 7: (13, 6, 8, 9) with edges (13, 6), (6, 8), (8, 9), and (9, 13).
- Cycle 8: (14, 12, 7, 5) with edges (14, 12), (12, 7), (7, 5), and (5, 14).
- Cycle 9: (14, 5, 7, 8) with edges (14, 5), (5, 7), (7, 8), and (8, 14).
- Cycle 10: (14, 11, 9, 4) with edges (14, 11), (11, 9), (9, 4), and (4, 14).

Step 2:
We check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (7, 8), 6>
- <2, (7, 8), 6>
- <3, (8, 9), 4>
- <4, (6, 9), 11>
- <5, (4, 9), 8>
- <6, (7, 8), 6>
- <7, (6, 9), 13>
- <8, (12, 7), 5>
- <9, (7, 8), 14>
- <10, (14, 9), 4>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 10 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final answer is [10].
