Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- <0, 7, 9, 10>
- <0, 7, 3, 6>
- <0, 7, 18, 5>
- <0, 1, 2, 19>
- <0, 1, 2, 19, 3>
- <1, 2, 19, 12>
- <1, 2, 19, 3>
- <2, 19, 12, 16>
- <2, 19, 3, 15>
- <3, 15, 18, 5>
- <3, 15, 4, 17>
- <3, 15, 16, 12>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
- <14, 17, 4, 11> with chord (8, 12)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found: [25]
