- <14, 5, 0, 9> (4-length cycle)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 7, 4> has one chord (1, 3)
- <1, 3, 13, 4> has one chord (1, 4)
- <4, 7, 13, 3> has one chord (4, 3)
- <4, 13, 3, 2> has one chord (4, 2)
- <5, 4, 7, 9> has one chord (5, 7)
- <5, 4, 13, 3> has one chord (5, 3)
- <7, 9, 0, 4> has one chord (7, 0)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found = 0

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
