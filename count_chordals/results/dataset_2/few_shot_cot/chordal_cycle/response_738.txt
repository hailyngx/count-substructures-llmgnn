Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more with all existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (2, 8, 4, 10, 2)
- Cycle 2: (2, 8, 0, 17, 2)
- Cycle 3: (2, 3, 10, 4, 12, 11, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 18, 14, 1, 19, 1, 7, 14, 18, 2)
- Cycle 5: (8, 4, 12, 15, 9, 10, 3, 11, 12, 14, 1, 13, 9, 15, 18, 14, 18, 2, 8)

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (8, 17).
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has multiple chords.

Therefore, the chordal 4-cycle in this graph is:
<2, 8, 0, 17> (Chord: (8, 17))

Since only one chordal 4-cycle is found, the final count is [1].
