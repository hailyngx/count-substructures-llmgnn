Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 8, 12, 0> with 1 chord (5, 12)
- Cycle 2: <1, 9, 14, 6, 1> with 1 chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 3: <2, 3, 7, 13, 2> with 1 chord (3, 13)
- Cycle 4: <3, 7, 13, 4, 3> with 1 chord (7, 4)
- Cycle 5: <4, 6, 5, 0, 4> with 1 chord (6, 0)
- Cycle 6: <5, 7, 13, 4, 5> with 1 chord (7, 4)
- Cycle 7: <6, 10, 13, 4, 6> with 1 chord (10, 13)
- Cycle 8: <8, 9, 1, 12, 8> with 1 chord (9, 12)
- Cycle 9: <9, 1, 7, 13, 9> with 1 chord (1, 13)
- Cycle 10: <10, 13, 7, 3, 10> with 1 chord (13, 3)
- Cycle 11: <12, 8, 5, 0, 12> with 1 chord (8, 5)
- Cycle 12: <13, 7, 2, 14, 13> with 1 chord (7, 14)
- Cycle 13: <14, 9, 1, 12, 14> with 1 chord (9, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 13 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [13].
