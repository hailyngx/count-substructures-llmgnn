Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle with nodes (5, 1, 2, 6, 5)
2. Cycle with nodes (5, 1, 4, 7, 5)
3. Cycle with nodes (5, 1, 7, 6, 5)
4. Cycle with nodes (5, 6, 7, 4, 5)
5. Cycle with nodes (9, 2, 6, 9)
6. Cycle with nodes (9, 2, 1, 5, 9)
7. Cycle with nodes (9, 2, 1, 4, 7, 9)
8. Cycle with nodes (9, 6, 7, 4, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

1. <1, (5, 6), 2, 5>
2. <1, (5, 4), 7, 5>
3. <1, (5, 7), 6, 5>
4. <5, (6, 7), 4, 5>
5. No chord in cycle (9, 2, 6, 9)
6. No chord in cycle (9, 2, 1, 5, 9)
7. <9, (2, 1), 4, 7>
8. No chord in cycle (9, 6, 7, 4, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [4].
