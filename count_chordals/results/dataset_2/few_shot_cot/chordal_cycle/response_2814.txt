Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- For simplicity, we can look at cycles of length 4 as longer cycles would involve the same edges.
- Some of the 4-cycles in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 0-6-4-8-0
2. Cycle 2: 1-4-6-1
3. Cycle 3: 2-4-8-2
4. Cycle 4: 3-4-6-3
5. Cycle 5: 5-9-8-5
6. Cycle 6: 7-2-5-3

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Only Cycle 1 (0-6-4-8-0) has a chord (6, 8) connecting non-adjacent nodes 0 and 4.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 5 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<Cycle 1, (6, 8)>
