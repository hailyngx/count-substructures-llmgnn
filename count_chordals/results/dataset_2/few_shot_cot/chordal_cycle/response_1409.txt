Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 10, 3, 5, 4, 6>
- <1, 18, 3, 5, 4, 6>
- <1, 18, 5, 12, 14, 8>
- <1, 18, 5, 12, 14, 7>
- <1, 8, 19, 17, 18, 5>
- <1, 8, 19, 17, 18, 3>
- <1, 8, 14, 7, 6, 13>
- <1, 11, 18, 17, 19, 4>
- <1, 11, 18, 17, 19, 15>
- <1, 11, 18, 17, 19, 12>
- <1, 11, 18, 5, 12, 14>
- <1, 11, 18, 5, 12, 13>
- <2, 15, 19, 17, 18, 5>
- <2, 15, 19, 17, 18, 3>
- <3, 10, 9, 13, 6, 4>
- <3, 10, 9, 13, 6, 7>
- <3, 10, 0, 6, 4, 5>
- <3, 10, 0, 6, 7, 14>
- <4, 19, 17, 18, 5, 12>
- <5, 18, 17, 19, 4, 6>
- <5, 18, 17, 19, 12, 14>
- <5, 18, 17, 19, 15, 2>
- <5, 18, 17, 9, 13, 6>
- <6, 13, 12, 14, 7, 16>
- <6, 13, 12, 19, 17, 9>
- <8, 1, 11, 18, 17, 19>
- <8, 1, 11, 18, 5, 12>
- <8, 1, 18, 17, 19, 4>
- <8, 1, 18, 3, 10, 0>
- <9, 10, 3, 5, 18, 17>

- <9, 13, 12, 19, 15, 2>
- <12, 13, 9, 17, 19, 4>
- <15, 19, 17, 18, 5, 12>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 18, 5, 12, 14, 8> (Chord: (12, 14))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 30 chordless cycles in the graph.
