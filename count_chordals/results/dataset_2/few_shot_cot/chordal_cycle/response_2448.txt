Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all edges present:
- <4, 12, 10, 17, 3>
- <4, 12, 9, 14, 19>
- <4, 2, 1, 13, 3>
- <4, 0, 18, 6, 13>
- <18, 6, 13, 1, 11>
- <18, 6, 19, 14, 9>
- <18, 0, 4, 12, 10>
- <18, 0, 4, 2, 1>
- <18, 7, 13, 3, 17>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <4, (12), 10, 17, 3>
- <4, 12, 9, (14), 19>
- <4, 2, (1), 13, 3>
- <4, (0), 18, 6, 13>
- <18, 6, (13), 1, 11>
- <18, 6, 19, (14), 9>
- <18, (0), 4, 12, 10>
- <18, (0), 4, 2, 1>
- <18, 7, (13), 3, 17>

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles = [4]
