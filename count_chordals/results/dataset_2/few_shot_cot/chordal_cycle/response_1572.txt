Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 6, 9>
- Cycle 2: <9, 3, 7, 6>
- Cycle 3: <4, 8, 7, 3>
- Cycle 4: <7, 4, 2, 6>
- Cycle 5: <6, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 9, 0>
- Cycle 7: <5, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle 8: <0, 5, 1, 4>
- Cycle 9: <3, 9, 0, 5>
- Cycle 10: <2, 4, 7, 3>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the following chordal 4-cycles have exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 1, 6, 9> with chord (1, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <9, 3, 7, 6> with chord (3, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, 8, 7, 3> with chord (8, 3)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, 4, 2, 6> with chord (4, 2)

Step 3:
The total number of chordal 4-cycles found is [4].
