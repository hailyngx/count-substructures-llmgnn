Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <5, 19, 1, 8> with the chord (5, 1).

To count the number of chordless cycles, we first need to find all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. Here are the cycles found:
- <5, 9, 13, 4>
- <5, 19, 15, 12>
- <5, 19, 13, 9>
- <5, 19, 1, 8>
- <9, 13, 4, 2>
- <9, 13, 14, 4>
- <9, 19, 15, 12>
- <9, 19, 15, 16>
- <7, 12, 15, 19>
- <7, 12, 17, 6>
- <7, 12, 17, 2>
- <12, 15, 19, 5>
- <12, 15, 19, 13>
- <12, 17, 6, 10>
- <12, 17, 2, 4>
- <19, 15, 12, 7>
- <19, 15, 16, 10>
- <19, 15, 16, 4>
- <5, 19, 15, 16>
- <5, 19, 1, 8>
- <13, 9, 5, 19>
- <13, 9, 19, 15>
- <13, 14, 4, 2>
- <13, 14, 4, 16>
- <13, 19, 15, 12>
- <13, 19, 15, 16>
- <14, 13, 9, 5>
- <14, 13, 19, 15>
- <14, 4, 16, 10>
- <14, 4, 16, 15>
- <4, 13, 9, 5>
- <4, 13, 14, 9>
- <4, 2, 17, 12>
- <4, 2, 17, 6>
- <4, 16, 15, 12>
- <4, 16, 15, 19>
- <16, 18, 11, 8>
- <16, 4, 13, 9>
- <16, 4, 14, 13>
- <16, 10, 6, 17>
- <16, 10, 6, 11>
- <18, 16, 15, 12>
- <18, 16, 15, 19>
- <3, 0, 11, 8>
- <11, 0, 3, 0>
- <11, 0, 8, 1>
- <11, 6, 17, 12>
- <11, 6, 17, 2>
- <11, 18, 16, 4>
- <8, 0, 3, 0>
- <8, 0, 1, 19>
- <8, 11, 6, 17>
- <8, 11, 6, 10>
- <2, 7, 12, 15>
- <2, 7, 12, 17>
- <2, 4, 16, 10>
- <2, 4, 16, 15>

Now, we need to check each cycle for exactly one chord. From the list of cycles above, only the cycle <5, 19, 1, 8> has exactly one chord.

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
