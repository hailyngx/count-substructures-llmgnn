Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 5, 8, 3>: (1, 8) is a chord
- <1, 7, 4, 9>: (1, 9) is a chord
- <1, 7, 4, 8>: (1, 8) is a chord
- <1, 3, 8, 5>: (1, 5) is a chord
- <3, 9, 4, 8>: (3, 8) is a chord
- <4, 7, 0, 5>: (4, 5) is a chord
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:
There are 56 cycles listed and 6 of them have exactly one chord. So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [50].
