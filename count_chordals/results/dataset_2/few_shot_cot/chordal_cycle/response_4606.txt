Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2)

- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 4, 9, 7, 3, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 5, 4, 6, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 4, 8, 7, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 8, 7, 3, 0, 2, 1>
- Cycle 6: <4, 8, 5, 1, 6, 4>
- Cycle 7: <4, 8, 7, 9, 4>
- Cycle 8: <5, 8, 7, 9, 1, 5>
- Cycle 9: <6, 8, 7, 9, 4, 6>
- Cycle 10: <7, 5, 1, 6, 4, 7>
- Cycle 11: <7, 5, 8, 4, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 12: <8, 4, 6, 1, 5, 8>
- Cycle 13: <8, 4, 6, 0, 3, 8>
- Cycle 14: <8, 4, 9, 7, 5, 8>
  
Step 2: 
Chordal 4-cycles: 
- <1, (5, 2), 0>
- <0, (6, 1), 5, 2, 0>
- <4, 8, 7, (9, 4), 6>
- <8, 7, 5, 1, (6, 4), 8>
- <8, 4, 6, 1, (5, 8), 7>

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles: [9]
