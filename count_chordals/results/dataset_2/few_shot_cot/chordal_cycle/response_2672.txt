Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 6, 1, 5>
2. Cycle <5, 9, 2, 7, 5>
3. Cycle <5, 9, 2, 6, 5>
4. Cycle <5, 9, 8, 1, 5>
5. Cycle <5, 1, 6, 3, 5>
6. Cycle <9, 6, 8, 4, 9>
7. Cycle <9, 6, 3, 5, 9>
8. Cycle <9, 8, 4, 0, 9>
9. Cycle <9, 8, 1, 5, 9>
10. Cycle <9, 2, 7, 4, 9>
11. Cycle <6, 1, 8, 4, 6>
12. Cycle <6, 1, 5, 3, 6>
13. Cycle <6, 3, 5, 9, 6>
14. Cycle <4, 8, 0, 5, 4>
15. Cycle <4, 8, 1, 6, 4>
16. Cycle <4, 7, 2, 9, 4>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (4-cycles) are:
1. Cycle <5, 9, 6, 1, 5> with chord (6, 1)
2. Cycle <9, 6, 8, 4, 9> with chord (8, 4)
3. Cycle <6, 1, 8, 4, 6> with chord (1, 4)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph = [3]
