Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the given graph, such as (4, 9, 6, 2), (3, 2, 7, 1), (8, 5, 0, 9), and many more.

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle (4, 9, 6, 2) has a chord between nodes 9 and 2.
- Cycle (3, 2, 7, 1) has a chord between nodes 2 and 7.
- Cycle (8, 5, 0, 9) does not have any chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles, we find that there is 1 chordal 4-cycle in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <4, 9, 6, 2>
