Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (5, 9, 6, 3)
- (5, 9, 7, 4)
- (5, 9, 8, 6)
- (5, 9, 3, 8)
- (9, 7, 4, 1)
- (9, 7, 0, 2)
- (9, 6, 4, 1)
- (9, 6, 7, 0)
- (4, 7, 0, 1)
- (4, 7, 2, 0)
- (7, 6, 4, 1)
- (7, 6, 9, 8)
- (6, 8, 9, 5)
- (6, 8, 3, 5)
- (8, 9, 5, 2)
- (8, 9, 3, 6)
- (0, 7, 9, 5)
- (0, 7, 4, 1)
- (2, 0, 7, 4)
- (2, 0, 1, 5)
- (1, 4, 7, 0)
- (1, 4, 6, 9)
- (3, 8, 9, 5)
- (3, 8, 6, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (0, 7), 4>
- <1, (0, 2), 5>
- <4, (6, 7), 9>
- <4, (6, 8), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are [4] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
