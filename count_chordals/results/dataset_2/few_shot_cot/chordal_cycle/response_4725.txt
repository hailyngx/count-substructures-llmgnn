Response:
After listing all cycles of length 4 or more, we find the following chordal 4-cycles in the graph:

1. <5, 4, 11, 10> with chord (4, 10)
2. <5, 4, 7, 1> with chord (4, 1)
3. <5, 4, 14, 1> with chord (4, 14)
4. <5, 4, 14, 6> with chord (4, 6)
5. <5, 11, 14, 4> with chord (11, 14)
6. <5, 11, 14, 6> with chord (11, 6)
7. <5, 14, 6, 1> with chord (6, 1)
8. <4, 11, 14, 6> with chord (11, 14)
9. <4, 14, 6, 1> with chord (14, 1)
10. <4, 14, 5, 0> with chord (5, 0)
11. <4, 14, 11, 13> with chord (14, 13)
12. <4, 14, 1, 9> with chord (14, 1)
13. <4, 14, 1, 7> with chord (14, 7)
14. <4, 14, 6, 13> with chord (14, 13) 

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [14].
