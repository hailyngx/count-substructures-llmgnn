Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 3) (8, 14) (8, 11) (8, 7) (8, 6) (13, 5) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 14) (13, 6) (3, 4) (3, 11) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (11, 8) (11, 3) (11, 14) (11, 7) (11, 1) (11, 0) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 11) (0, 6) (10, 12) (10, 1) (10, 2) (14, 4) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 11) (14, 6) (7, 8) (7, 11) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 11) (1, 10) (1, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 3) (6, 0) (6, 14) (6, 2) (2, 3) (2, 10) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (12, 13) (12, 10) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, 11, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 11, 10, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 10, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 11, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 14, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 13
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 13, 3, 0, 14, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 11, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 14, 11, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 12, 1, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 8, 3, 14, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 13, and node 10
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 9, 12, 14, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 4, 8, 13, 11, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 4, 14, 8, 0>
2. <1, 11, 8, 7, 1>
3. <2, 6, 8, 14, 2>
4. <3, 6, 13, 12, 3>
5. <4, 0, 3, 11, 4>
6. <5, 9, 13, 12, 5>
7. <6, 8, 14, 13, 6>
8. <7, 8, 11, 1, 7>
9. <10, 12, 13, 5, 10>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
<0, 4, 14, 8, 0> with chord (8, 14)

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
