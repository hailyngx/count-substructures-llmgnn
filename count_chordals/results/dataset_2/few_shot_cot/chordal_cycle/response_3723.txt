Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 5) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 8) (2, 3) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 9, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles in the graph, but we are interested in finding chordal 4-cycles.

One chordal 4-cycle in this graph is <0, 8, 4, 6> with a chord 8:

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Only one of the cycles found in Step 1 has exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle in this graph: [<0, 8, 4, 6>].
