Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <0, 9, 5, 4, 0>
        - Cycle 2: <0, 9, 5, 8, 0>
        - Cycle 3: <1, 9, 5, 4, 1>
        - Cycle 4: <2, 5, 6, 3, 2>
        - Cycle 5: <2, 5, 8, 4, 2>
        - Cycle 6: <3, 9, 5, 8, 3>
        - Cycle 7: <3, 9, 5, 4, 3>
        - Cycle 8: <4, 5, 8, 3, 4>
        - Cycle 9: <5, 9, 2, 7, 5>
        - Cycle 10: <5, 9, 3, 6, 5>
        - Cycle 11: <6, 5, 8, 3, 6>
        - Cycle 12: <7, 2, 5, 9, 7>
        - Cycle 13: <7, 3, 9, 5, 7>
        - Cycle 14: <8, 5, 9, 3, 8>
        - Cycle 15: <9, 5, 8, 4, 9>
        - Cycle 16: <9, 5, 2, 1, 9>
        - Cycle 17: <9, 5, 6, 3, 9>
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - Cycle 1 has a chord: (5, 8)
        - Cycle 2 has a chord: (5, 8)
        - Cycle 3 has a chord: (4, 1)
        - Cycle 4 has no chord
        - Cycle 5 has a chord: (5, 8)
        - Cycle 6 has a chord: (5, 8)
        - Cycle 7 has a chord: (5, 8)
        - Cycle 8 has a chord: (5, 8)
        - Cycle 9 has no chord
        - Cycle 10 has no chord
        - Cycle 11 has a chord: (5, 8)
        - Cycle 12 has no chord
        - Cycle 13 has no chord
        - Cycle 14 has a chord: (5, 8)
        - Cycle 15 has a chord: (5, 8)
        - Cycle 16 has a chord: (5, 2)
        - Cycle 17 has no chord
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 6 chordless cycles: <0, 9, 5, 4, 0>, <2, 5, 6, 3, 2>, <9, 5, 2, 1, 9>, <7, 2, 5, 9, 7>, <9, 5, 6, 3, 9>, and <7, 3, 9, 5, 7>.
        Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles is [6].
