Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are two cycles of length 4 that can be found in the graph:
    1. (1, 9, 5, 8, 1)
    2. (1, 9, 4, 8, 1)

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
    1. <1, (5, 8), 9>
    2. <1, (4, 8), 9>

Step 3:
- The final count of chordal 4-cycles is [2].
