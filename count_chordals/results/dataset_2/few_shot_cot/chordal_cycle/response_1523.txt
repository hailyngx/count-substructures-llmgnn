Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 7, 3, 5> with edges (5, 1), (1, 7), (7, 3), (3, 5), (5, 1)
- Cycle 2: <5, 1, 3, 8, 5> with edges (5, 1), (1, 3), (3, 8), (8, 5), (5, 1)
- Cycle 3: <5, 1, 12, 4, 5> with edges (5, 1), (1, 12), (12, 4), (4, 5), (5, 1)
- Cycle 4: <5, 14, 6, 0, 4, 5> with edges (5, 14), (14, 6), (6, 0), (0, 4), (4, 5), (5, 14)
- Cycle 5: <5, 3, 11, 2, 9, 1, 5> with edges (5, 3), (3, 11), (11, 2), (2, 9), (9, 1), (1, 5), (5, 3)
- Cycle 6: <5, 14, 6, 13, 9, 1, 5> with edges (5, 14), (14, 6), (6, 13), (13, 9), (9, 1), (1, 5), (5, 14)
- Cycle 7: <5, 8, 2, 11, 3, 1, 5> with edges (5, 8), (8, 2), (2, 11), (11, 3), (3, 1), (1, 5), (5, 8)
- Cycle 8: <5, 1, 12, 10, 0, 6, 14, 5> with edges (5, 1), (1, 12), (12, 10), (10, 0), (0, 6), (6, 14), (14, 5), (5, 1)
- Cycle 9: <5, 3, 11, 6, 14, 5> with edges (5, 3), (3, 11), (11, 6), (6, 14), (14, 5), (5, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- In Cycle 1: <5, 1, 7, 3, 5> - One chord (1, 3)
- In Cycle 2: <5, 1, 3, 8, 5> - One chord (1, 8)
- In Cycle 3: <5, 1, 12, 4, 5> - One chord (1, 4)
- In Cycle 5: <5, 3, 11, 2, 9, 1, 5> - One chord (3, 9)
- In Cycle 6: <5, 14, 6, 13, 9, 1, 5> - One chord (14, 1)
- In Cycle 7: <5, 8, 2, 11, 3, 1, 5> - One chord (8, 1)
- In Cycle 8: <5, 1, 12, 10, 0, 6, 14, 5> - One chord (1, 6)
- In Cycle 9: <5, 3, 11, 6, 14, 5> - One chord (3, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [1].

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
