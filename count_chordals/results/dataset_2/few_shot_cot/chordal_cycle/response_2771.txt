Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 3, 5, 3)
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 8, 3, 4, 12, 8, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 8, 3, 5, 3, 4, 12, 8, 2)
- Cycle 4: (7, 2, 8, 3, 5, 3, 4, 12, 8, 7)
- Cycle 5: (9, 7, 2, 8, 3, 5, 3, 4, 12, 8, 7, 15, 2)
- Cycle 6: (9, 13, 14, 11, 14, 16, 19, 13)
- Cycle 7: (10, 9, 7, 2, 8, 3, 5, 3, 4, 12, 8, 7, 15, 17, 18, 0, 6, 0)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Chord <0, 5>
- Cycle 2: Chord <0, 3>
- Cycle 3: Chord <2, 8>
- Cycle 4: Chord <2, 8>
- Cycle 5: Chord <7, 15>
- Cycle 6: Chord <13, 16>
- Cycle 7: Chord <9, 10>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 4 chordless 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <0, 1, 8, 3, 4, 12, 8, 1>
2. <9, 13, 14, 11, 14, 16, 19, 13>
3. <10, 9, 7, 2, 8, 3, 5, 3, 4, 12, 8, 7, 15, 17, 18, 0, 6, 0>
4. <2, 8, 3, 5, 3, 4, 12, 8, 2>
