Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
    - <2, 7, 9, 13>          (Cycle of length 4)
    - <2, 7, 6, 10>          (Cycle of length 4)
    - <2, 7, 18, 0>          (Cycle of length 4)
    - <2, 7, 9, 23>          (Cycle of length 4)
    - <2, 11, 25, 17>        (Cycle of length 4)
    - <2, 11, 25, 22>        (Cycle of length 4)
    - <2, 11, 25, 17, 28>    (Cycle of length 5)
    - <2, 11, 25, 22, 21>    (Cycle of length 5)

    - <5, 21, 1, 26>         (Cycle of length 4)
    - <5, 21, 1, 19>         (Cycle of length 4)
    - <5, 21, 22, 4>         (Cycle of length 4)
    - <5, 10, 6, 7>          (Cycle of length 4)
    - <5, 10, 6, 12>         (Cycle of length 4)
    - <5, 10, 6, 7, 18>      (Cycle of length 5)
    - <5, 10, 6, 12, 17>     (Cycle of length 5)
    - <5, 10, 29, 18>        (Cycle of length 4)
    - <5, 24, 3, 16>         (Cycle of length 4)
    - <5, 24, 3, 28>         (Cycle of length 4)
    - <5, 24, 23, 14>        (Cycle of length 4)
    - <5, 24, 23, 9>         (Cycle of length 4)
    - <5, 24, 23, 14, 15>    (Cycle of length 5)
    - <5, 24, 23, 9, 15>     (Cycle of length 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
    - <2, 7, 18, 0>          (Chord: 7-18)
    - <2, 27, 0, 18>         (Chord: 2-18)
    - <3, 16, 27, 0>         (Chord: 16-27)
    - <5, 10, 29, 18>        (Chord: 10-18)
    - <5, 24, 3, 16>         (Chord: 5-3)
    - <5, 24, 23, 14>        (Chord: 24-23)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
    From the above steps, we find 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count is [0].
