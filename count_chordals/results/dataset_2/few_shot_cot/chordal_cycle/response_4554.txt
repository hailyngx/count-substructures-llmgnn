Step 2: Checking for chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord):
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 3, 15, 4> with chord (0, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 8, 11, 16> with chord (8, 19)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 6, 7, 17> with chord (6, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 8, 11, 16> with chord (1, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 18, 16, 11> with chord (2, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, 15, 3, 0> with chord (4, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, 18, 16, 11> with chord (5, 17)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <7, 17, 5, 2> with chord (7, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <7, 6, 0, 3> with chord (7, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <9, 16, 11, 8> with chord (9, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <10, 12, 16, 11> with chord (10, 13)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 34.

Therefore, the final result is [11].
