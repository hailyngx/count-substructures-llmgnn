Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 9, 11, 2, 0>
- Cycle <0, 9, 19, 12, 0>
- Cycle <0, 14, 1, 12, 0>
- Cycle <0, 16, 1, 14, 0>
- Cycle <0, 16, 4, 19, 12, 0>
- Cycle <0, 3, 2, 12, 0>
- Cycle <0, 3, 7, 8, 11, 9, 0>
- Cycle <0, 3, 7, 8, 17, 16, 0>
- Cycle <0, 12, 2, 15, 18, 11, 9, 0>
- Cycle <1, 14, 0, 9, 19, 12, 1>
- Cycle <1, 14, 0, 3, 7, 8, 17, 16, 1>
- Cycle <1, 16, 0, 9, 11, 2, 15, 18, 10, 1>
- Cycle <2, 3, 7, 8, 17, 16, 4, 19, 12, 2>
- Cycle <4, 5, 13, 15, 18, 11, 9, 19, 12, 16, 4>
  
Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 9, 11, 2, 0> has a unique chord (9, 2)
- <0, 9, 19, 12, 0> has a unique chord (9, 12)
- <0, 14, 1, 12, 0> has a unique chord (14, 12)
- <0, 16, 1, 14, 0> has a unique chord (16, 14)
- <0, 16, 4, 19, 12, 0> has a unique chord (4, 12)
- <0, 3, 2, 12, 0> has a unique chord (3, 12)
- <0, 3, 7, 8, 11, 9, 0> has a unique chord (7, 9)
- <0, 3, 7, 8, 17, 16, 0> has a unique chord (7, 16)
- <0, 12, 2, 15, 18, 11, 9, 0> has a unique chord (12, 9)
- <1, 14, 0, 9, 19, 12, 1> has a unique chord (1, 19)
- <1, 14, 0, 3, 7, 8, 17, 16, 1> has a unique chord (1, 8)
- <1, 16, 0, 9, 11, 2, 15, 18, 10, 1> has a unique chord (1, 10)
- <2, 3, 7, 8, 17, 16, 4, 19, 12, 2> has a unique chord (3, 19)
- <4, 5, 13, 15, 18, 11, 9, 19, 12, 16, 4> has a unique chord (5, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles = [0]
