Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, including:
- Cycle 1: 11 - 16 - 25 - 15 
- Cycle 2: 11 - 16 - 10 - 24 
- Cycle 3: 18 - 22 - 24 - 28 
- Cycle 4: 18 - 22 - 7 - 29 
- Cycle 5: 22 - 24 - 12 - 17 
- Cycle 6: 22 - 24 - 6 - 11 
- Cycle 7: 1 - 22 - 24 - 6 
- Cycle 8: 1 - 22 - 7 - 29 
- Cycle 9: 8 - 15 - 25 - 11 
- Cycle 10: 8 - 15 - 19 - 13 
- Cycle 11: 8 - 17 - 19 - 15 
- Cycle 12: 8 - 17 - 3 - 10 
- Cycle 13: 9 - 8 - 17 - 19 
- Cycle 14: 9 - 8 - 27 - 18 
- Cycle 15: 9 - 0 - 26 - 12 
- Cycle 16: 3 - 0 - 28 - 24 
- Cycle 17: 3 - 17 - 19 - 13 
- Cycle 18: 3 - 17 - 5 - 21 
- Cycle 19: 17 - 8 - 27 - 18 
- Cycle 20: 17 - 5 - 21 - 20 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

Now, let's identify the unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <11, 25, 15, 19> (Chord: 25)
- <11, 16, 10, 24> (Chord: 10)
- <22, 7, 29, 13> (Chord: 29)
- <22, 24, 12, 17> (Chord: 12)
- <1, 22, 7, 29> (Chord: 22)
- <8, 15, 19, 13> (Chord: 15)
- <8, 17, 19, 15> (Chord: 19)
- <9, 8, 27, 18> (Chord: 8)
- <3, 0, 28, 24> (Chord: 0)
- <17, 5, 21, 20> (Chord: 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Hence, the final count is [10].
