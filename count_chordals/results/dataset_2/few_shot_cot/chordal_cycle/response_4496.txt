Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (6, 3) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: 5-1-3-7-5 (with edges (5,1), (1,3), (3,7), (7,5))
- Cycle 2: 5-1-2-8-5 (with edges (5,1), (1,2), (2,8), (8,5))
- Cycle 3: 5-1-0-4-5 (with edges (5,1), (1,0), (0,4), (4,5))
- Cycle 4: 1-3-6-8-1 (with edges (1,3), (3,6), (6,8), (8,1))
- Cycle 5: 3-7-0-4-3 (with edges (3,7), (7,0), (0,4), (4,3))
- Cycle 6: 1-0-7-5-1 (with edges (1,0), (0,7), (7,5), (5,1))
- Cycle 7: 8-2-9-8 (with edges (8,2), (2,9), (9,8))
- Cycle 8: 1-2-9-8-1 (with edges (1,2), (2,9), (9,8), (8,1))
- Cycle 9: 3-1-8-3 (with edges (3,1), (1,8), (8,3))

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- In Cycle 1, we have two chords: (1,7) and (3,5)
- In Cycle 2, we have one chord: (1,8)
- In Cycle 3, we have one chord: (0,5)
- In Cycle 4, we have one chord: (1,8)
- In Cycle 5, we have one chord: (3,0)
- In Cycle 6, we have one chord: (1,5)
- In Cycle 7, there are no chords
- In Cycle 8, we have one chord: (1,9)
- In Cycle 9, there are no chords

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found. 

Final answer: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (1,8), 5, 1>
- <1, (0,5), 4, 5>
- <1, (1,5), 7, 5>
- <1, (1,9), 2, 8>
- <1, (3,0), 4, 3>
