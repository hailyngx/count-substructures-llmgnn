Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 5) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 7) (0, 3) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 3

Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 4, 1> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 1, 4> 
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 5, 4> 
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 5, 4> 
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 8, 2> 
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 5, 4> 
- Cycle 7: <1, 9, 3, 7> 
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 8, 6> 
- Cycle 9: <2, 6, 5, 4> 
- Cycle 10: <2, 8, 3, 4> 
- Cycle 11: <2, 8, 9, 1> 
- Cycle 12: <3, 7, 5, 6> 
- Cycle 13: <3, 5, 6, 8> 
- Cycle 14: <3, 1, 9, 2> 
- Cycle 15: <4, 1, 3, 0> 
- Cycle 16: <4, 5, 3, 7> 
- Cycle 17: <4, 2, 8, 6> 
- Cycle 18: <4, 7, 0, 3> 
- Cycle 19: <5, 4, 2, 8> 
- Cycle 20: <5, 7, 0, 3> 
- Cycle 21: <5, 3, 1, 9> 
- Cycle 22: <6, 8, 4, 1> 
- Cycle 23: <6, 5, 3, 7> 
- Cycle 24: <6, 2, 4, 8> 
- Cycle 25: <7, 0, 3, 5> 
- Cycle 26: <7, 4, 8, 2> 
- Cycle 27: <8, 4, 1, 3> 
- Cycle 28: <8, 2, 6, 5> 
- Cycle 29: <8, 3, 0, 7> 
- Cycle 30: <9, 1, 3, 7> 
- Cycle 31: <9, 2, 4, 8> 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
- <0, (4, 5), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 31 cycles listed. So, there are [31] chordless cycles in the graph.
