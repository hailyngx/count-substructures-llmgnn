Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 9, 2, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 2, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 4, 8, 9, 2>
- Cycle 5: <3, 7, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 6: <4, 7, 3, 8, 4>
- Cycle 7: <5, 9, 8, 4, 5>
- Cycle 8: <6, 5, 1, 7, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord {(1, 6)}
- Cycle 2 has a chord {(1, 9)}
- Cycle 3 has a chord {(2, 9)}
- Cycle 4 has a chord {(4, 8)}
- Cycle 5 has a chord {(4, 8)}
- Cycle 6 has a chord {(7, 8)}
- Cycle 7 has a chord {(5, 8)}
- Cycle 8 has a chord {(1, 7)}

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are no chordless cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
