Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Node 0 -> Node 4 -> Node 5 -> Node 6 -> Node 0
- Node 0 -> Node 4 -> Node 2 -> Node 7 -> Node 8 -> Node 0
- Node 0 -> Node 1 -> Node 4 -> Node 5 -> Node 0
- Node 0 -> Node 1 -> Node 4 -> Node 6 -> Node 0
- Node 0 -> Node 1 -> Node 8 -> Node 7 -> Node 2 -> Node 0
- Node 0 -> Node 1 -> Node 8 -> Node 6 -> Node 5 -> Node 0
- Node 0 -> Node 3 -> Node 9 -> Node 7 -> Node 8 -> Node 0
- Node 0 -> Node 3 -> Node 9 -> Node 7 -> Node 6 -> Node 0
- Node 0 -> Node 3 -> Node 8 -> Node 7 -> Node 2 -> Node 0
- Node 0 -> Node 3 -> Node 8 -> Node 6 -> Node 5 -> Node 0

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 4, 6, 0> -> Chord: (1,6)
- <0, 3, 9, 7, 8, 0> -> Chord: (9,8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [8]
