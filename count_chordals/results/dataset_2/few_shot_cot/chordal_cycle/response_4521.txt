Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 4, 3, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 0, 2, 8, 7, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 7, 8, 3, 5>
- Cycle 4: <9, 8, 2, 0, 9>
- Cycle 5: <1, 3, 8, 7, 1>
- Cycle 6: <3, 9, 0, 4, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord: (0, 8)
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord: (2, 9)
- Cycle 5 has no chords
- Cycle 6 has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. In this case, Cycle 5 and Cycle 6 are chordless cycles.
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [2]. 

The unique chordless 4-cycles are:
<1, 3, 8, 7>
<3, 9, 0, 4>
