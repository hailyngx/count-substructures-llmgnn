Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 6, 10, 5, 0>
- <1, 4, 7, 9, 1>
- <1, 11, 3, 10, 1>
- <1, 11, 12, 3, 1>
- <2, 5, 9, 11, 2>
- <3, 10, 5, 13, 3>
- <3, 11, 13, 5, 3>
- <3, 12, 1, 4, 7, 9, 3>
- <3, 12, 1, 14, 13, 11, 3>
- <4, 7, 9, 5, 13, 11, 4>
- <5, 9, 11, 13, 3, 10, 6, 8, 5>
- <5, 9, 11, 12, 1, 14, 13, 5>
- <6, 10, 5, 9, 7, 4, 1, 12, 6>
- <8, 5, 13, 11, 1, 4, 7, 9, 8>
- <8, 6, 10, 3, 11, 13, 5, 9, 8>
- <11, 9, 5, 13, 14, 1, 12, 11>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <1, (14, 3), 11>
- <3, (1, 12), 11>

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [15].
