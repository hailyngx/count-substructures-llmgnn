Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 27, 18, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 27, 29, 21, 4, 6, 9, 26, 5, 11, 23, 17, 2, 12, 13, 15, 13, 12, 2, 21, 29>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycles found: <2, (17, 23), 7>, <4, (16, 24), 22>, <8, (18, 20), 26>, <10, (11, 25), 9>, <12, (13, 29), 21>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordless cycles: [13]
