Response:
Step 1:  
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:  
1. <0, 6, 8, 4>  
2. <0, 4, 8, 18>  
3. <1, 17, 10, 2>  
4. <1, 17, 2, 14>  
5. <1, 12, 19, 5>  
6. <3, 7, 11, 6>  
7. <3, 7, 14, 1>  
8. <3, 14, 2, 10>  
9. <3, 14, 5, 15>  
10. <5, 15, 9, 6>  
11. <5, 15, 8, 18>  
12. <5, 14, 1, 17>  
13. <5, 14, 2, 12>  
14. <6, 9, 15, 5>  
15. <6, 11, 7, 3>  
16. <6, 11, 9, 2>  
17. <6, 8, 15, 5>  
18. <7, 11, 9, 6>  
19. <8, 4, 0, 6>  
20. <10, 17, 1, 14>  
21. <10, 17, 2, 9>  
22. <11, 7, 3, 14>  
23. <11, 9, 6, 0>  
24. <12, 1, 17, 2>  
25. <12, 19, 5, 14>  
26. <13, 19, 12, 1>  

Step 2:  
Chordal 4-cycles:  
1. <0, 4, 8, 18> (Chord: 8-18)  
2. <1, 17, 10, 2> (Chord: 10-2)  
3. <3, 7, 14, 1> (Chord: 14-1)  
4. <5, 15, 9, 6> (Chord: 9-6)  
5. <5, 14, 2, 12> (Chord: 2-12)  
6. <6, 11, 7, 3> (Chord: 7-3)  
7. <8, 4, 0, 6> (Chord: 4-6)  
8. <10, 17, 1, 14> (Chord: 1-14)  
9. <12, 1, 17, 2> (Chord: 1-17)  
10. <13, 19, 12, 1> (Chord: 12-1)  

Step 3:  
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
