Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- <5, 9, 4, 14>
- <5, 9, 10, 5>
- <5, 2, 3, 12>
- <5, 2, 7, 1>
- <9, 4, 14, 5>
- <4, 8, 3, 12>
- <4, 8, 9, 5>
- <4, 13, 12, 3>
- <8, 9, 11, 6>
- <8, 3, 12, 1>
- <0, 14, 4, 9>
- <0, 3, 8, 9>
- <14, 5, 2, 1>
- <13, 4, 9, 10>
- <2, 5, 14, 0>
- <2, 7, 3, 6>
- <12, 13, 4, 14>
- <12, 10, 6, 11>
- <10, 5, 9, 8>
- <3, 8, 4, 13>
- <3, 7, 1, 11>
- <7, 2, 5, 13>
- <1, 14, 0, 3>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <5, 9, 4, 14>, chord: (5, 9)
- <5, 9, 10, 5>, chord: (9, 10)
- <5, 2, 3, 12>, chord: (2, 3)
- <5, 2, 7, 1>, chord: (2, 7)
- <9, 4, 14, 5>, chord: (4, 14)
- <4, 8, 3, 12>, chord: (8, 12)
- <4, 8, 9, 5>, chord: (8, 9)
- <4, 13, 12, 3>, chord: (13, 12)
- <8, 9, 11, 6>, chord: (9, 11)
- <8, 3, 12, 1>, chord: (3, 12)
- <0, 14, 4, 9>, chord: (14, 4)
- <0, 3, 8, 9>, chord: (3, 8)
- <14, 5, 2, 1>, chord: (5, 2)
- <13, 4, 9, 10>, chord: (4, 9)
- <2, 5, 14, 0>, chord: (5, 14)
- <2, 7, 3, 6>, chord: (7, 3)
- <12, 13, 4, 14>, chord: (13, 4)
- <12, 10, 6, 11>, chord: (10, 6)
- <10, 5, 9, 8>, chord: (5, 9)
- <3, 8, 4, 13>, chord: (8, 4)
- <3, 7, 1, 11>, chord: (7, 1)
- <7, 2, 5, 13>, chord: (2, 5)
- <1, 14, 0, 3>, chord: (14, 0)

Step 3:
There are 22 chordal 4-cycles in total, so the answer is [22].
