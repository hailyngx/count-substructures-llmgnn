Response:
Step 1: Based on the given information, we can identify the following cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 5, 8, 14, 0>
- Cycle <1, 10, 4, 12, 13, 2, 1>
- Cycle <3, 8, 14, 13, 4, 12, 3>
- Cycle <3, 7, 1, 10, 9, 11, 6, 3>
- Cycle <4, 5, 8, 14, 13, 12, 4>
- Cycle <5, 3, 6, 10, 4, 13, 5>
- Cycle <6, 11, 9, 10, 4, 12, 3, 6>
- Cycle <8, 14, 13, 4, 5, 3, 0, 8>
- Cycle <11, 9, 10, 1, 7, 3, 8, 11>
- Cycle <12, 13, 0, 14, 8, 5, 10, 4, 12>
- Cycle <13, 11, 9, 10, 1, 7, 3, 12, 13>
- Cycle <14, 8, 5, 3, 0, 13, 12, 4, 14>

Step 2: For each of these cycles, identify the ones with exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 5, 8, 14, 0> has 2 chords: 14-8 and 8-5
- Cycle <1, 10, 4, 12, 13, 2, 1> has 2 chords: 1-10 and 10-4
- Cycle <3, 8, 14, 13, 4, 12, 3> has 2 chords: 3-8 and 8-14
- Cycle <3, 7, 1, 10, 9, 11, 6, 3> has 2 chords: 3-7 and 7-1
- Cycle <4, 5, 8, 14, 13, 12, 4> has 2 chords: 4-5 and 5-8
- Cycle <5, 3, 6, 10, 4, 13, 5> has 2 chords: 5-3 and 3-6
- Cycle <6, 11, 9, 10, 4, 12, 3, 6> has 2 chords: 6-11 and 11-9
- Cycle <8, 14, 13, 4, 5, 3, 0, 8> has 2 chords: 8-14 and 14-13
- Cycle <11, 9, 10, 1, 7, 3, 8, 11> has 2 chords: 11-9 and 9-10
- Cycle <12, 13, 0, 14, 8, 5, 10, 4, 12> has 2 chords: 12-13 and 13-0
- Cycle <13, 11, 9, 10, 1, 7, 3, 12, 13> has 2 chords: 13-11 and 11-9
- Cycle <14, 8, 5, 3, 0, 13, 12, 4, 14> has 2 chords: 14-8 and 8-5

Step 3: The number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [0] since all identified cycles have 2 chords each.
