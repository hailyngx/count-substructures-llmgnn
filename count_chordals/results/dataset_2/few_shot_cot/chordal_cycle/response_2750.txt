Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: (0, 11, 3, 18, 0)
        - Cycle 2: (1, 11, 0, 15, 1)
        - Cycle 3: (1, 11, 4, 14, 10, 1)
        - Cycle 4: (2, 13, 9, 7, 11, 3, 6, 2)
        - Cycle 5: (4, 11, 0, 15, 4)
        - Cycle 6: (4, 11, 3, 6, 4)
        - Cycle 7: (4, 11, 7, 16, 4)
        - Cycle 8: (5, 8, 12, 6, 17, 2, 13, 5)
        - Cycle 9: (5, 8, 12, 14, 10, 1, 11, 7, 16, 4, 14, 12, 6, 3, 11, 0, 15, 5)
        - Cycle 10: (5, 8, 10, 1, 11, 7, 9, 13, 2, 17, 6, 3, 18, 11, 4, 14, 12, 19, 7, 16, 5)
        - Cycle 11: (7, 9, 13, 2, 17, 6, 12, 14, 4, 11, 0, 15, 7)
        - Cycle 12: (7, 9, 13, 10, 1, 11, 3, 18, 0, 15, 4, 16, 7)
        - Cycle 13: (7, 11, 3, 6, 17, 2, 13, 9, 7)
        - Cycle 14: (8, 5, 19, 7, 11, 4, 16, 12, 9, 13, 5)
        - Cycle 15: (12, 8, 5, 19, 7, 16, 4, 14, 10, 13, 9, 12)
        - Cycle 16: (14, 7, 11, 3, 18, 0, 15, 4, 16, 12, 14)
        - Cycle 17: (14, 10, 1, 11, 3, 6, 17, 2, 13, 9, 12, 14)
        - Cycle 18: (14, 12, 6, 3, 11, 0, 15, 4, 16, 7, 9, 13, 5, 8, 10, 14)
        - Cycle 19: (16, 7, 11, 0, 15, 4, 14, 10, 1, 11, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
        - The chordal 4-cycles are:
            <2, (6, 9), 17>
            <10, (1, 14), 13>
            <15, (11, 0), 4>
            <16, (7, 4), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There are 15 chordless 4-cycles.

Final count: [15]
