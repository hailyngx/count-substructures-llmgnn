Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 5, 16, 3, 8>
- Cycle 2: <1, 9, 12, 14, 11, 17>
- Cycle 3: <2, 8, 3, 16, 6, 10>
- Cycle 4: <4, 15, 13, 19, 7, 18>
- Cycle 5: <5, 7, 18, 16, 6, 10>
- Cycle 6: <9, 8, 3, 16, 6, 10>
- Cycle 7: <11, 14, 3, 16, 6, 10>
- Cycle 8: <12, 9, 1, 17, 19, 13>
- Cycle 9: <13, 15, 4, 2, 8, 3>
- Cycle 10: <14, 12, 9, 1, 17, 19>
- Cycle 11: <16, 18, 7, 5, 6, 10>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 3 has exactly one chord: <2, (3), 16, 6, 10>
- Cycle 6 has exactly one chord: <9, (8), 3, 16, 6, 10>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles:
There are no chordless 4-cycles found in the given graph.

Final count: [0]
