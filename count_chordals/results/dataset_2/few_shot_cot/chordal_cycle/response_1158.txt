Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (0, 12, 7, 5, 10) with edges (0, 12), (12, 7), (7, 5), (5, 10), (10, 17), (17, 29), (29, 14), (14, 18), (18, 28)
- Cycle 2: (0, 12, 7, 18, 14) with edges (0, 12), (12, 7), (7, 18), (18, 14), (14, 17), (17, 29), (29, 5), (5, 10), (10, 17)
- Cycle 3: (0, 12, 7, 18, 28) with edges (0, 12), (12, 7), (7, 18), (18, 28), (28, 13), (13, 22), (22, 8), (8, 27), (27, 17)
- Cycle 4: (0, 12, 20, 21, 26) with edges (0, 12), (12, 20), (20, 21), (21, 26), (26, 24), (24, 1), (1, 2), (2, 13), (13, 22)
- Cycle 5: (0, 16, 26, 24, 1) with edges (0, 16), (16, 26), (26, 24), (24, 1), (1, 2), (2, 15), (15, 3), (3, 4), (4, 22)
- Cycle 6: (0, 16, 20, 10, 17) with edges (0, 16), (16, 20), (20, 10), (10, 17), (17, 14), (14, 29), (29, 5), (5, 7), (7, 12)
- Cycle 7: (0, 16, 26, 21, 20) with edges (0, 16), (16, 26), (26, 21), (21, 20), (20, 10), (10, 17), (17, 27), (27, 8), (8, 22)
- Cycle 8: (0, 8, 6, 25, 4) with edges (0, 8), (8, 6), (6, 25), (25, 4), (4, 3), (3, 13), (13, 22), (22, 4), (4, 25)
- Cycle 9: (0, 8, 6, 16, 26) with edges (0, 8), (8, 6), (6, 16), (16, 26), (26, 24), (24, 1), (1, 28), (28, 9), (9, 28)
- Cycle 10: (0, 8, 27, 17, 14) with edges (0, 8), (8, 27), (27, 17), (17, 14), (14, 29), (29, 5), (5, 7), (7, 18), (18, 28)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8: No chords present
- Cycle 5: <5, (2, 15), 22>
- Cycle 7: <7, (10, 17), 16>
- Cycle 9: <9, (1, 28), 0>
- Cycle 10: <10, (5, 7), 20>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 6.
Therefore, the final answer is [6].
