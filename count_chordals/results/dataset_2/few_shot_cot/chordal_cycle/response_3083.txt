Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1-5-7-3-1
2. Cycle 1-5-9-6-1
3. Cycle 1-5-9-4-0
4. Cycle 1-5-7-3-6-2
5. Cycle 1-5-9-6-3-7
6. Cycle 1-5-7-3-6-0
7. Cycle 1-5-9-6-2-0
8. Cycle 1-5-9-4-8-0
9. Cycle 1-5-7-3-2-0
10. Cycle 1-5-9-4-0-8

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. Cycle 1-5-9-4-0 with chord (9, 4)
2. Cycle 1-5-7-3-6-0 with chord (3, 6)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 5, 9, 4, 0> with chord (9, 4)
<1, 5, 7, 3, 6, 0> with chord (3, 6)
