Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 7, 17, 1> 
- <0, 7, 17, 13>
- <0, 4, 1, 17>
- <0, 4, 1, 13>
- <0, 4, 16, 10>
- <0, 3, 10, 11>
- <0, 3, 10, 15>
- <0, 3, 2, 1>
- <0, 5, 8, 5>
- <7, 10, 15, 16>
- <7, 17, 13, 11>
- <7, 17, 13, 1>
- <7, 17, 13, 19>
- <7, 17, 19, 14>
- <7, 0, 3, 2>
- <1, 13, 19, 17>
- <1, 13, 19, 14>
- <1, 2, 3, 0>
- <1, 17, 19, 9>
- <1, 17, 19, 14>
- <10, 3, 2, 1>
- <10, 3, 2, 3>
- <10, 15, 16, 12>
- <10, 15, 16, 4>
- <10, 15, 9, 19>
- <10, 15, 9, 17>
- <10, 16, 12, 16>
- <10, 16, 12, 4>
- <10, 16, 4, 1>
- <10, 16, 4, 14>
- <13, 11, 10, 3>
- <13, 11, 10, 7>
- <13, 17, 19, 14>
- <16, 4, 1, 17>
- <16, 4, 1, 13>
- <16, 4, 14, 19>
- <19, 17, 7, 0>
- <19, 17, 1, 13>
- <19, 17, 1, 2>
- <19, 14, 4, 1>
- <19, 14, 4, 16>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 7, 17, 1> has a chord (7, 17)
- <0, 4, 1, 13> has a chord (4, 13)
- <0, 3, 10, 15> has a chord (3, 15)
- <7, 10, 15, 16> has a chord (10, 15)
- <1, 13, 19, 14> has a chord (13, 19)
- <10, 16, 12, 4> has a chord (16, 12)
- <13, 11, 10, 3> has a chord (11, 3)
- <16, 4, 1, 17> has a chord (4, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0].
