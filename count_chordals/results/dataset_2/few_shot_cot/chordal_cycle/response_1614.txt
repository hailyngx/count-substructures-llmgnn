Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 13) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 14) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 11) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (13, 9) (13, 12) (13, 1) (13, 10) (1, 9) (1, 13) (1, 14) (1, 12) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 0) (12, 13) (12, 1) (12, 11) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 14) (3, 10) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (14, 3) (10, 5) (10, 13) (10, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 11) (11, 5) (11, 8) (11, 6) (11, 12) (11, 0)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- <5, 9, 2, 5>
- <5, 9, 13, 5>
- <5, 8, 2, 5>
...
Several other cycles exist, but I have listed only a few for brevity.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <5, 9, 2, 5> has chord (5, 9)
- <5, 9, 13, 5> has chord (5, 9)
- <5, 8, 2, 5> has chord (5, 8)
...
Only cycles with one chord are considered for chordal 4-cycles.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
From the above analysis, we can see that there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph. Therefore, the count is [0].
