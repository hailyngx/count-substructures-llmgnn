Response:
Let's go through the steps to find the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- From the given edges and adjacency list, we can identify potential cycles. Upon examining these cycles, we find the following 4-cycles in the graph:
<0, 1, 14, 4>
<0, 1, 6, 13>
<2, 4, 12, 8>
<2, 5, 11, 6>
<3, 5, 13, 10>
<4, 10, 12, 8>
<5, 7, 6, 13>
<5, 8, 12, 2>
<5, 11, 6, 1>
<6, 7, 5, 13>
<8, 0, 14, 4>
<10, 4, 12, 8>
<10, 6, 11, 5>
<12, 4, 14, 0>
<12, 8, 3, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- After inspecting each cycle, we find that only the cycle <0, 1, 14, 4> has exactly one chord which is (1, 4).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle with one chord found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1]. The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 1, 14, 4> with a single chord (1, 4).
