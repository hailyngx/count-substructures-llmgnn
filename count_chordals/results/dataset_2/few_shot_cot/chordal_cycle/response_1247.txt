Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1:  
There are several cycles in the graph with length 4 or more. We will list them below:  
1. <0, 4, 6, 8>  
2. <0, 2, 7, 5>  
3. <0, 2, 7, 3>  
4. <0, 4, 5, 7>  
5. <1, 4, 6, 8>  
6. <1, 8, 6, 9>  
7. <2, 6, 8, 9>  
8. <3, 0, 2, 7>  
9. <3, 5, 4, 0>  

Step 2:  
Out of these cycles, we will check each for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 6, 8> has a chord 2  
- <0, 2, 7, 5> has a chord 4  
- <0, 2, 7, 3> has a chord 5  
So, these cycles are not chordal 4-cycles.

Step 3:  
The chordless cycles found are:
1. <0, 4, 5, 7>  
2. <1, 4, 6, 8>  
3. <1, 8, 6, 9>  
4. <2, 6, 8, 9>  

Therefore, there are [4] chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
