Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 7, 3, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 4, 3, 7, 9, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 9, 8, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 9, 8, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 4, 3, 7, 9, 1, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 4, 7, 3, 8, 5, 0>
- Cycle 8: <2, 6, 9, 1, 4, 2>
- Cycle 9: <3, 7, 9, 1, 4, 3>
- Cycle 10: <4, 1, 9, 7, 3, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 3, 7, 8, 5, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 5, 8, 7, 3, 4>
- Cycle 13: <5, 0, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5>
- Cycle 14: <5, 4, 0, 1, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 15: <5, 4, 3, 7, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 16: <6, 9, 7, 4, 2, 6>
- Cycle 17: <7, 3, 4, 1, 9, 7>
- Cycle 18: <7, 4, 3, 8, 5, 7>
- Cycle 19: <8, 5, 4, 0, 1, 8>
- Cycle 20: <9, 0, 4, 1, 9>
- Cycle 21: <9, 1, 4, 7, 3, 9>
- Cycle 22: <9, 6, 7, 4, 1, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-Cycle 1: <0, 5, 8, 7, 3, 4, 0> (Chord: (5, 3))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 2: <0, 1, 4, 3, 7, 9, 0> (Chord: (1, 7))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 3: <0, 1, 9, 8, 7, 4, 0> (Chord: (1, 8))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 4: <0, 1, 9, 8, 5, 4, 0> (Chord: (1, 5))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 5: <0, 4, 3, 7, 9, 1, 0> (Chord: (4, 9))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 6: <0, 4, 7, 3, 8, 5, 0> (Chord: (4, 5))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 7: <5, 0, 4, 3, 7, 8, 5> (Chord: (0, 8))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 8: <4, 1, 9, 7, 3, 4> (Chord: (1, 3))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 9: <7, 4, 3, 8, 5, 7> (Chord: (4, 5))
- Chordal 4-Cycle 10: <9, 0, 4, 1, 9> (Chord: (0, 1))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [10]
