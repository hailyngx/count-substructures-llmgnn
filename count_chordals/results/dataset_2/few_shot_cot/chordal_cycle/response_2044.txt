Response:
Step 1: 
- There is a 4-cycle with edges (0, 7), (7, 5), (5, 1), and (1, 8) with no chords.
- There is a 4-cycle with edges (0, 16), (16, 17), (17, 10), and (10, 0) with no chords.
- There is a 4-cycle with edges (0, 18), (18, 19), (19, 15), and (15, 8) with no chords.
- There is a 4-cycle with edges (5, 1), (1, 8), (8, 15), and (15, 19) with no chords.
- There is a 4-cycle with edges (5, 7), (7, 2), (2, 6), and (6, 5) with no chords.

Step 2:
- There are no chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Step 3:
Since there are no chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, the count of chordless cycles is [5].
