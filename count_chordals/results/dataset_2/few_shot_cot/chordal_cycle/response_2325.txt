Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 1) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 1, 0, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 5, 1, 2, 4)
- Cycle 3: (1, 7, 4, 5, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord
- Cycle 2 has no chord
- Cycle 3 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
As all cycles identified are chordless, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].

Unique chordless 4-cycles in the graph:
- <4, 5, 1, 0>
- <4, 5, 1, 2>
- <1, 7, 4, 5>
