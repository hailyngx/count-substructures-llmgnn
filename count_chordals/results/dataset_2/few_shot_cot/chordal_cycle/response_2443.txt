Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (0, 7) (0, 6) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 2: <9, 4, 1, 2, 9>
- Cycle 3: <4, 7, 2, 1, 4>
- Cycle 4: <7, 0, 6, 8, 7>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 2, 3, 1>
- Cycle 6: <3, 5, 7, 2, 3>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 4, 3, 2>

Step 2:
Identifying the cycles with exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 4, 7, 5> has the chord (4, 7)
- <9, 4, 1, 2, 9> has the chord (1, 2)
- <4, 7, 2, 1, 4> has the chord (2, 1)
- <1, 9, 2, 3, 1> has the chord (9, 2)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles: 
There are no chordless 4-cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final count is [0].
