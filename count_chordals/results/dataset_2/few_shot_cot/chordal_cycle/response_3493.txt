Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (0, 1, 3, 7)
- (0, 1, 6, 14)
- (0, 1, 2, 13)
- (0, 1, 2, 14)
- (0, 1, 6, 7)
- (0, 1, 6, 2)
- (0, 1, 5, 12)
- (0, 1, 5, 14)
- (0, 1, 3, 9)
- (0, 8, 4, 10)
- (0, 8, 11, 12)
- (0, 8, 4, 10)
- (0, 8, 13, 12)
- (0, 8, 13, 2)
- (0, 8, 11, 12)
- (0, 14, 6, 7)
- (0, 14, 6, 2)
- (0, 14, 5, 12)
- (0, 14, 5, 2)
- (0, 7, 3, 1)
- (0, 7, 6, 14)
- (0, 7, 6, 2)
- (0, 7, 5, 12)
- (1, 6, 14, 2)
- (1, 6, 7, 5)
- (1, 3, 7, 5)
- (1, 3, 7, 6)
- (1, 2, 13, 8)
- (1, 2, 14, 0)
- (1, 2, 14, 5)
- (1, 5, 12, 10)
- (2, 13, 12, 11)
- (2, 13, 12, 5)
- (2, 13, 12, 11)
- (2, 14, 5, 12)
- (3, 7, 6, 14)
- (4, 8, 11, 0)
- (4, 8, 11, 12)
- (4, 8, 13, 12)
- (5, 12, 13, 8)
- (6, 7, 14, 2)
- (6, 7, 5, 12)
- (8, 13, 12, 5)

- (11, 8, 13, 12)
- (11, 12, 13, 8)
- (12, 13, 8, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 2, 14> (chord: 1, 14)
- <0, 1, 5, 12> (chord: 1, 5)
- <0, 8, 4, 10> (chord: 4, 10)
- <0, 8, 13, 12> (chord: 8, 12)
- <0, 14, 6, 7> (chord: 6, 7)
- <1, 3, 7, 5> (chord: 3, 5)
- <1, 6, 14, 2> (chord: 6, 14)
- <2, 13, 12, 5> (chord: 13, 5)
- <3, 7, 6, 14> (chord: 7, 6)
- <4, 8, 11, 12> (chord: 8, 11)
- <5, 12, 13, 8> (chord: 12, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [10].
