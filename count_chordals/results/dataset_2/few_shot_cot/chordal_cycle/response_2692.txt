Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 14) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (9, 0) (9, 12) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 11) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 12) (7, 0) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (13, 9) (13, 7) (13, 5) (13, 0) (12, 9) (12, 4) (12, 7) (12, 10) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 13) (0, 10) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 2) (10, 12) (10, 0) (10, 2) (10, 14) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 14) (14, 6) (14, 10) (14, 11) (14, 3) (14, 2) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 14) (2, 6) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 10) (2, 14)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <9, 8, 4, 12>
- Cycle 2: <4, 8, 9, 6>
- Cycle 3: <6, 9, 0, 7>
- Cycle 4: <7, 0, 10, 12>
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 13, 7>
- Cycle 6: <5, 6, 9, 13>
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 5, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 6, 9, 8>
- Cycle 9: <3, 4, 7, 12>
- Cycle 10: <10, 0, 7, 13>
- Cycle 11: <12, 4, 11, 1>
- Cycle 12: <13, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 13: <14, 6, 9, 8>
- Cycle 14: <11, 14, 2, 1>
- Cycle 15: <14, 11, 4, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 1: <9, 8, 4, 12> has exactly one chord <8, 4>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
