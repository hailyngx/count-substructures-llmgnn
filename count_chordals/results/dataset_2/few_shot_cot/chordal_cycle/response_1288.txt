Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (7, 1, 4, 24, 8, 3, 15) of length 6
- Cycle 2: (10, 1, 7, 27, 26) of length 5
- Cycle 3: (12, 23, 13, 20, 9, 22) of length 6
- Cycle 4: (14, 25, 6, 9, 20, 29) of length 6
- Cycle 5: (16, 10, 26, 27, 19) of length 5
- Cycle 6: (16, 10, 1, 4, 12) of length 5
- Cycle 7: (17, 1, 7, 27, 19) of length 5
- Cycle 8: (18, 15, 3, 5, 15) of length 5
- Cycle 9: (20, 13, 23, 12, 4) of length 5
- Cycle 10: (21, 4, 12, 11, 12) of length 5

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:

- Cycle 1 has chord (1, 24)
- Cycle 2 has chord (7, 26)
- Cycle 3 has chord (13, 9)
- Cycle 4 has chord (6, 29)
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has chord (10, 4)
- Cycle 7 has chord (1, 27)
- Cycle 8 has chord (8, 5)
- Cycle 9 has chord (20, 12)
- Cycle 10 has chord (4, 12)

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles = [7]
Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (1, 24), 4, 8>
- <2, 7, (7, 26), 27>
- <3, 9, (9, 13), 22>
- <4, 6, (6, 29), 25>
- <5, 10, 26, 27, 19>
- <6, 16, (10, 4), 12>
- <7, 21, 4, (4, 12)>
