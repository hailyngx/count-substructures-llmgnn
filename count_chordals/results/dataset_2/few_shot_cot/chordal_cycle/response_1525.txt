1. <0, 4, 7, 5, 1>
2. <0, 4, 7, 13, 6>
3. <0, 4, 7, 12, 8>
4. <0, 4, 2, 5, 1>
5. <0, 4, 2, 5, 7>
6. <0, 4, 10, 9, 14>
7. <1, 4, 7, 5, 6>
8. <1, 4, 0, 6, 5>
9. <1, 4, 0, 6, 13>
10. <1, 5, 7, 4, 2>
11. <1, 5, 2, 4, 0>
12. <2, 4, 7, 5, 6>
13. <2, 4, 0, 6, 5>
14. <3, 6, 7, 4, 0>
15. <3, 6, 5, 1, 0>
16. <3, 11, 14, 6, 5>
17. <3, 11, 14, 9, 10>
18. <6, 5, 7, 4, 2>
19. <6, 5, 2, 4, 0>
20. <6, 13, 7, 4, 0>
21. <6, 13, 3, 11, 14>
22. <7, 13, 6, 5, 1>
23. <9, 10, 14, 6, 3>
24. <9, 10, 14, 11, 3>
25. <10, 14, 6, 13, 7>
26. <10, 9, 0, 4, 2>
27. <10, 9, 0, 6, 13>
28. <11, 0, 4, 7, 5>
29. <11, 0, 4, 2, 5>
30. <11, 3, 6, 5, 1>
31. <11, 3, 6, 0, 4>
32. <13, 7, 4, 2, 5>
33. <13, 6, 5, 1, 0>
34. <14, 6, 13, 3, 11>

Step 2:
- The chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <0, 4, 7, 5, 1> with chord 6.
  
Step 3:
- Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [34].
