Node 2 is connected to node 1, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 9, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 1, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 4, 6, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 2, 1, 4, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 2, 4, 6, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 2, 7, 6, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 4, 6, 5, 1>
- Cycle 9: <3, 9, 7, 2, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 4, 6, 8, 3>
- Cycle 11: <4, 6, 5, 4>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 3, 9, 8, 0> - Chord (3, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 3, 1, 4, 0> - Chord (1, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 3, 4, 6, 0> - Chord (3, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 2, 1, 4, 0> - Chord (1, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, 2, 4, 6, 0> - Chord (2, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, 3, 9, 7, 1> - Chord (3, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, 2, 7, 6, 1> - Chord (2, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, 4, 6, 5, 1> - Chord (4, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <3, 9, 7, 2, 3> - Chord (9, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <3, 4, 6, 8, 3> - Chord (4, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
