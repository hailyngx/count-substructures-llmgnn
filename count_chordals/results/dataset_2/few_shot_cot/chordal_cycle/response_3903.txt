Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 3, 15>, Chord: (1, 15)
- <0, 1, 4, 13>, Chord: (1, 13)
- <1, 3, 15, 6>, Chord: (3, 6)
- <1, 4, 13, 28>, Chord: (4, 13)
- <4, 13, 28, 7>, Chord: (13, 28)
- <4, 13, 28, 21>, Chord: (13, 28)
- <5, 24, 15, 3>, Chord: (15, 24)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 32 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordless 4-cycles is [32].
