- <0, 2, 1, 3, 4, 8> has a chord: (2, 8)
- <0, 2, 1, 3, 9, 5> has a chord: (2, 9)
- <0, 2, 6, 5, 9, 1> has a chord: (2, 5)
- <0, 8, 5, 9, 1, 2> has a chord: (8, 9)
- <1, 2, 3, 9, 0, 8> has a chord: (1, 8)
- <1, 2, 6, 5, 9, 3> has a chord: (1, 5)
- <1, 3, 4, 8, 5, 9> has a chord: (1, 5)
- <2, 0, 9, 5, 8, 4> has a chord: (2, 4)
- <2, 1, 9, 5, 6, 4> has a chord: (2, 6)
