Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, 9, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 9, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. Cycle: <0, 5, 1, 4>. Chords: (1, 5).
2. Cycle: <0, 5, 7, 6>. Chords: (0, 6).
3. Cycle: <0, 8, 5, 7>. Chords: (0, 7).
4. Cycle: <1, 5, 8, 7>. Chords: (1, 8).
5. Cycle: <2, 6, 7, 3>. Chords: (2, 3).
6. Cycle: <2, 6, 4, 9>. Chords: (2, 9).
7. Cycle: <2, 8, 7, 5>. Chords: (2, 7).
8. Cycle: <3, 6, 4, 1>. Chords: (3, 4).
9. Cycle: <3, 7, 5, 1>. Chords: (3, 5).
10. Cycle: <4, 6, 7, 5>. Chords: (4, 7).
11. Cycle: <4, 9, 8, 5>. Chords: (4, 8).
12. Cycle: <5, 1, 7, 9>. Chords: (1, 9).
13. Cycle: <5, 8, 9, 4>. Chords: (5, 4).
14. Cycle: <6, 7, 9, 4>. Chords: (6, 9).

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle with only one chord: <2, (8, 4), 7>.
- Chordal 4-cycle with only one chord: <0, (5, 1), 4>.
- Chordal 4-cycle with only one chord: <5, (1, 9), 7>.
- Chordal 4-cycle with only one chord: <3, (2, 9), 6>.

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [10].
