Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, 7, 13, 1>.

Following the steps outlined:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 7, 1, 14, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 7, 1, 13, 5, 12, 14, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 7, 1, 10, 5, 12, 14, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 7, 1, 13, 5, 10, 4, 9, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 7, 6, 10, 4, 9, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 7, 6, 11, 2, 12, 14, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 7, 6, 4, 9, 0)
- Cycle 8: (0, 7, 13, 5, 10, 4, 9, 0)
- Cycle 9: (0, 14, 12, 5, 10, 4, 9, 0)
- Cycle 10: (7, 1, 13, 5, 12, 14, 0, 9, 4, 10, 6, 7)
- Cycle 11: (7, 1, 10, 4, 9, 0, 14, 3, 8, 7)
- Cycle 12: (7, 1, 13, 5, 12, 14, 3, 8, 7)
- Cycle 13: (7, 6, 11, 2, 12, 14, 0, 9, 4, 10, 1, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 6, 10, 1, 13, 5, 12, 14, 0, 9, 4, 6)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 7, 13, 1> has exactly one chord which is the edge connecting node 7 and node 1.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
As the unique chordal 4-cycle <0, 7, 13, 1> is the only cycle with exactly one chord, the total count is [1].
