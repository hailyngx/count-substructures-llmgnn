Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are several cycles of length 4 in this graph. To simplify, we can start by listing the cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 5 - 9 - 14 - 6 - 5
- Cycle 2: 5 - 9 - 10 - 13 - 5
- Cycle 3: 5 - 11 - 3 - 7 - 5
- Cycle 4: 5 - 0 - 13 - 9 - 5
- Cycle 5: 14 - 6 - 2 - 7 - 14
- Cycle 6: 14 - 8 - 4 - 13 - 14

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Let's analyze each cycle for the presence of a chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: 9 - 6
- Cycle 2 has a chord: 9 - 13
- Cycle 3 has a chord: 11 - 7
- Cycle 4 has a chord: 0 - 9
- Cycle 5 has a chord: 6 - 7
- Cycle 6 has a chord: 8 - 13

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [6].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <5, 9, 14, 6> (chord: (9, 6))
2. <5, 9, 10, 13> (chord: (9, 13))
3. <5, 11, 3, 7> (chord: (11, 7))
4. <5, 0, 13, 9> (chord: (0, 9))
5. <14, 6, 2, 7> (chord: (6, 7))
6. <14, 8, 4, 13> (chord: (8, 13))
