Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 36: <27, 17, 14, 11>
- Cycle 37: <27, 17, 10, 15>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, 9, 15, 10> with the chord (5, 10).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- There are 36 chordless cycles.

Putting it all together, the final result is [36].
