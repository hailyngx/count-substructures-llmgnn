Step 2: Chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 11), 5, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (13, 14), 17, 15, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (1, 13), 15, 4, 12, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, (5, 15), 17, 14, 13, 1>

Final step - counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 16 chordless 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [16].
