Response:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <3, 14, 11, 1> with chord (14, 1)
2. <3, 12, 4, 7> with chord (12, 7)
3. <3, 14, 11, 9> with chord (14, 9)
4. <4, 16, 18, 10> with chord (16, 10)
5. <4, 7, 2, 12> with chord (7, 12)
6. <5, 18, 16, 4> with chord (18, 4)
7. <5, 1, 11, 13> with chord (1, 13)
8. <7, 2, 12, 0> with chord (2, 0)

Therefore, the total number of chordless cycles found is [8].
