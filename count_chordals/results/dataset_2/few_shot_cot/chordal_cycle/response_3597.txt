Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (5, 9, 4, 5)
- (5, 9, 1, 5)
- (5, 9, 3, 5)
- (5, 9, 4, 7, 5)
- (5, 9, 1, 6, 5)
- (5, 4, 7, 6, 5)
- (9, 1, 6, 7, 9)
- (9, 1, 11, 4, 9)
- (9, 1, 11, 13, 9)
- (9, 4, 7, 6, 9)
- (4, 7, 6, 1, 4)
- (4, 7, 3, 13, 4)
- (7, 6, 1, 9, 7)
- (10, 11, 4, 7, 10)
- (10, 11, 13, 8, 10)
- (11, 13, 8, 2, 11)
- (11, 13, 1, 5, 11)
- (8, 13, 3, 7, 8)
- (13, 1, 6, 7, 13)
- (13, 1, 5, 4, 13)
- (13, 3, 7, 6, 13)
- (12, 5, 9, 3, 12)
- (0, 9, 5, 4, 0)
- (0, 9, 1, 11, 0)
- (14, 9, 5, 4, 14)
- (14, 9, 3, 7, 14)
- (2, 5, 9, 1, 2)
- (2, 5, 7, 4, 2)
- (2, 5, 9, 3, 2)
- (2, 7, 4, 11, 2)
- (2, 7, 6, 14, 2)
- (2, 7, 3, 13, 2)
- (2, 10, 11, 1, 2)
- (2, 10, 12, 5, 2)
- (2, 3, 13, 11, 2)
- (1, 5, 9, 0, 1)
- (1, 5, 4, 7, 1)
- (1, 5, 11, 13, 1)
- (1, 6, 7, 3, 1)
- (6, 7, 4, 11, 6)
- (6, 7, 3, 13, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, (3, 12), 9>
- <1, (11, 13), 9>
- <4, (6, 7), 9>
- <7, (1, 9), 4>
- <10, (13, 8), 11>
- <11, (1, 13), 4>
- <8, (3, 13), 13>
- <12, (3, 9), 5>
- <0, (5, 4), 9>
- <14, (7, 3), 9>
- <2, (5, 9), 7>
- <6, (4, 11), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles in total, so the final count is [12].
