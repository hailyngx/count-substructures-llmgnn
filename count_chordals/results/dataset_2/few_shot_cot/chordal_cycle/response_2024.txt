Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 0-2-10-19
- Cycle 0-2-13-4
- Cycle 0-2-18-17
- Cycle 0-11-15-6
- Cycle 0-11-8-4
- Cycle 1-0-2-13
- Cycle 1-0-11-8
- Cycle 1-7-18-17
- Cycle 2-10-19-17
- Cycle 2-18-17-6
- Cycle 2-13-4-9
- Cycle 3-11-15-6
- Cycle 3-11-8-4

- Cycle 6-15-8-11
- Cycle 6-17-18-7
- Cycle 6-18-17-19
- Cycle 6-4-13-2
- Cycle 7-18-17-19

- Cycle 13-2-18-17

Step 2: Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- <0, 2, 13, 4> (Chord: 13-4)
- <0, 11, 15, 6> (Chord: 15-6)
- <1, 0, 2, 13> (Chord: 2-13)
- <6, 15, 8, 11> (Chord: 8-11)
- <6, 17, 18, 7> (Chord: 18-7)
- <8, 4, 13, 2> (Chord: 13-2)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [6]
