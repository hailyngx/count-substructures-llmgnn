Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 4, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 6, 1, 0, 2, 9, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 6, 8, 7, 11, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 11, 7, 8, 6, 5>
- Cycle 5: <9, 2, 12, 6, 8, 7, 11, 4, 9>
- Cycle 6: <9, 2, 12, 6, 5, 11, 7, 0, 13, 9>
- Cycle 7: <9, 2, 12, 11, 7, 8, 6, 5, 4, 9>
- Cycle 8: <9, 4, 12, 6, 5, 11, 7, 8, 4>
  
Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes) are:
- <5, 9, 4, 5> with a chord (9, 4)
- <9, 2, 12, 6, 8, 7, 11, 4, 9> with a chord (8, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [6]

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
- <5, 9, 4, 5>
- <9, 2, 12, 6, 8, 7, 11, 4, 9>
