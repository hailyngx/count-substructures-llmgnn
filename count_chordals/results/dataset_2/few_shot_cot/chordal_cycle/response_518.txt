- Cycle 2 has a chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 10 has a chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 11 has a chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 12 has a chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 13 has a chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 14 has a chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 15 has a chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 16 has a chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 17 has a chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 18 has a chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 19 has a chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 20 has a chord: (9, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 18 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [18].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
- <9, (5), 7, 1>
- <9, (5), 4, 1>
- <9, (7), 4, 1>
- <9, (7), 4, 5>
- <9, (4), 7, 1>
- <9, (4), 7, 5>
- <9, (4), 7, 3>
- <9, (4), 8, 0>
- <9, (5), 7, 3, 0>
- <9, (5), 7, 4, 1>
- <9, (5), 7, 4, 5>
- <9, (3), 7, 4, 1>
- <9, (3), 7, 4, 5>
- <9, (3), 7, 0>
- <9, (0), 3, 7, 1>
- <9, (0), 3, 7, 4>
- <9, (0), 3, 7, 5>
- <9, (0), 3, 7, 1, 5, 7, 4>
