Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 5) (2, 5) (2, 7) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (3, 1, 4, 3)
- Cycle 3: (4, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 4: (5, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 5: (6, 9, 0, 6)
- Cycle 6: (8, 6, 1, 8)
- Cycle 7: (0, 9, 6, 0)
- Cycle 8: (3, 5, 6, 3)
- Cycle 9: (4, 8, 5, 4)
- Cycle 10: (0, 3, 1, 0)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 <1, (4, 8), 6>: Chord between nodes 4 and 8
- Cycle 2 <3, (1, 4), 3>: Chord between nodes 1 and 4
- Cycle 3 <4, (6, 9), 4>: Chord between nodes 6 and 9
- Cycle 4 <5, (1, 6), 5>: Chord between nodes 1 and 6
- Cycle 5 <6, (0, 9), 6>: Chord between nodes 0 and 9
- Cycle 6 <8, (1, 6), 8>: Chord between nodes 1 and 6
- Cycle 7 <0, (6, 9), 0>: Chord between nodes 6 and 9
- Cycle 8 <3, (5, 6), 3>: Chord between nodes 5 and 6
- Cycle 9 <4, (5, 8), 4>: Chord between nodes 5 and 8
- Cycle 10 <0, (1, 3), 0>: Chord between nodes 1 and 3

Step 3:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord. Thus, the final count is [10].
