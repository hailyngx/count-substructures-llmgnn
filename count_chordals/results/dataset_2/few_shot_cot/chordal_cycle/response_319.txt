Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 6) (9, 7) (9, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, 5, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: {0, 4, 5, 1, 0}
- Cycle 2: {1, 7, 4, 2, 1}
- Cycle 3: {2, 4, 7, 6, 2}
- Cycle 4: {3, 2, 8, 5, 3}
- Cycle 5: {5, 8, 2, 4, 5}
- Cycle 6: {6, 7, 1, 0, 6}
- Cycle 7: {7, 9, 8, 2, 7}
- Cycle 8: {8, 9, 7, 6, 8}

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycle in the graph is:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (2, 4), 5>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [7].
