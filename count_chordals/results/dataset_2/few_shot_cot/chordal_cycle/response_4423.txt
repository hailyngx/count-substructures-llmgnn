Step 2: Check for chords:
- Chordal cycle 1: <0, 7, 4, 6> (Chord: (7, 4))
- Chordal cycle 2: <0, 13, 12, 2> (Chord: (13, 12))
- Chordal cycle 3: <1, 2, 8, 4> (Chord: (2, 8))
- Chordal cycle 4: <1, 2, 3, 14> (Chord: (2, 3))
- Chordal cycle 5: <2, 7, 4, 8> (Chord: (7, 8))
- Chordal cycle 6: <2, 7, 5, 11> (Chord: (7, 5))
- Chordal cycle 7: <8, 4, 6, 1> (Chord: (4, 1))

Step 3: Count chordless cycles = 43 - 7 = 36
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [36].
