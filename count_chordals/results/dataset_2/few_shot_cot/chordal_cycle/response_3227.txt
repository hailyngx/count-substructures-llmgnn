Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is: <4, (9, 13), 12> 

Following the steps to find the number of chordal 4-cycles: 

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (4, 9, 3, 13, 4) with chords (9, 13)
- Cycle 2: (4, 13, 12, 14, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 12, 17, 5, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 10, 12, 14, 4)
- Cycle 5: (9, 3, 13, 4, 9) with chords (3, 13)
- Cycle 6: (9, 6, 17, 5, 9)
- Cycle 7: (9, 14, 12, 13, 9)
- Cycle 8: (13, 3, 9, 14, 13)
- Cycle 9: (13, 4, 12, 12, 13)
- Cycle 10: (12, 15, 0, 18, 12)
- Cycle 11: (12, 17, 5, 4, 12) with chords (5, 17)
- Cycle 12: (12, 17, 6, 9, 12)
- Cycle 13: (12, 4, 10, 4, 12)
- Cycle 14: (9, 3, 16, 11, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (9, 13)
- Cycle 2 has no chord
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has no chord
- Cycle 5 has one chord (3, 13)
- Cycle 6 has no chord
- Cycle 7 has no chord
- Cycle 8 has no chord
- Cycle 9 has no chord
- Cycle 10 has no chord
- Cycle 11 has one chord (5, 17)
- Cycle 12 has no chord
- Cycle 13 has no chord
- Cycle 14 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
There is 1 chordal cycle found, so the number of chordless cycles is [13].
