Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle: (0, 8, 7, 4)
2. Cycle: (0, 8, 3, 5)
3. Cycle: (0, 10, 2, 7)
4. Cycle: (0, 10, 2, 12)
5. Cycle: (0, 10, 6, 5)
6. Cycle: (1, 4, 7, 12)
7. Cycle: (1, 4, 6, 5)
8. Cycle: (2, 5, 6, 13)
9. Cycle: (2, 5, 11, 14)
10. Cycle: (2, 7, 8, 10)
11. Cycle: (2, 7, 12, 11)
12. Cycle: (3, 5, 6, 13)
13. Cycle: (3, 8, 7, 12)
14. Cycle: (3, 8, 10, 6)
15. Cycle: (3, 12, 7, 4)
16. Cycle: (4, 6, 10, 8)
17. Cycle: (5, 6, 13, 9)
18. Cycle: (7, 12, 11, 14)
19. Cycle: (10, 12, 7, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle <0, 8, 7, 4> has a chord: (7, 4)
- Cycle <0, 8, 3, 5> has a chord: (3, 5)
- Cycle <0, 10, 2, 7> has a chord: (0, 2)
- Cycle <0, 10, 2, 12> has a chord: (2, 12)
- Cycle <0, 10, 6, 5> has a chord: (6, 5)
- Cycle <1, 4, 7, 12> has a chord: (4, 12)
- Cycle <1, 4, 6, 5> has a chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle <2, 5, 6, 13> has a chord: (5, 13)
- Cycle <2, 5, 11, 14> has a chord: (11, 14)
- Cycle <2, 7, 8, 10> has a chord: (7, 8)
- Cycle <2, 7, 12, 11> has a chord: (7, 11)
- Cycle <3, 5, 6, 13> has a chord: (5, 6)
- Cycle <3, 8, 7, 12> has a chord: (7, 12)
- Cycle <3, 8, 10, 6> has a chord: (10, 6)
- Cycle <3, 12, 7, 4> has a chord: (7, 4)
- Cycle <4, 6, 10, 8> has a chord: (6, 10)
- Cycle <5, 6, 13, 9> has a chord: (6, 13)
- Cycle <7, 12, 11, 14> has a chord: (11, 14)
- Cycle <10, 12, 7, 14> has a chord: (12, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 19 chordal 4-cycles in total, so the final result is [0].
