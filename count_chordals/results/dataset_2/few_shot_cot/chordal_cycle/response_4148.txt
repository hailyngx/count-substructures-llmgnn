Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-6-1-8-0
- Cycle 2: 0-6-4-5-3-0
- Cycle 3: 0-8-3-5-4-0
- Cycle 4: 0-1-6-9-3-0
- Cycle 5: 2-7-5-3-8-2
- Cycle 6: 2-4-6-9-7-2
- Cycle 7: 2-0-8-3-5-2
- Cycle 8: 2-7-9-4-6-2
- Cycle 9: 4-6-9-3-5-4
- Cycle 10: 4-5-3-8-2-4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 0-8 as a chord.
- Cycle 2 has 6-4 as a chord.
- Cycle 3 has 8-3 as a chord.
- Cycle 4 has 1-9 as a chord.
- Cycle 5 has 7-5 as a chord.
- Cycle 6 has 4-6 as a chord.
- Cycle 7 has 2-8 as a chord.
- Cycle 8 has 7-9 as a chord.
- Cycle 9 has 6-3 as a chord.
- Cycle 10 has 5-8 as a chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<0, (8-3)>
