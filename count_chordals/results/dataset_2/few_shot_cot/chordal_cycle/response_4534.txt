Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (8, 3) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 7, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 6>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 3, 9>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 6, 4>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 3, 9>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 6, 8>
- Cycle 6: <2, 8, 6, 4>
- Cycle 7: <3, 5, 1, 6>
- Cycle 8: <3, 0, 8, 2>
- Cycle 9: <4, 9, 3, 8>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 has a chord (3, 9) as the edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is <0, 5, 1, 6> with the chord (3, 9).
