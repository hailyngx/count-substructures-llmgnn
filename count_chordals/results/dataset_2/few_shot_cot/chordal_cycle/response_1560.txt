Response:
Let's go through the steps to find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more
- One of the cycles with length 4 is: <6, 7, 16, 0, 6>.
- Another cycle with length 4 is: <6, 7, 12, 10, 6>.
- Yet another cycle with length 4 is: <10, 3, 26, 13, 10>.
- One more cycle with length 4 is: <11, 6, 7, 12, 11>.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord
- For cycle <6, 7, 16, 0, 6>, adding the edge (7, 16) as a chord results in a chordal 4-cycle <6, 7, (16, 0), 6>.
- For cycle <6, 7, 12, 10, 6>, adding the edge (7, 12) as a chord results in a chordal 4-cycle <6, 7, (12, 10), 6>.
- For cycle <10, 3, 26, 13, 10>, adding the edge (3, 26) as a chord results in a chordal 4-cycle <10, 3, (26, 13), 10>.
- For cycle <11, 6, 7, 12, 11>, adding the edge (6, 12) as a chord results in a chordal 4-cycle <11, 6, (12, 7), 11>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found
- We found 4 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
