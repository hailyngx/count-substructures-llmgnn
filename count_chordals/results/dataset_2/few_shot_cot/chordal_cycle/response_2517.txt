Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph (with existing edges):
- <0, 5, 9, 1, 0>
- <0, 1, 9, 5, 0>
- <1, 9, 5, 6, 1>
- <1, 6, 5, 9, 1>
- <2, 9, 5, 6, 2>
- <2, 6, 5, 9, 2>
- <3, 4, 9, 5, 3>
- <3, 5, 9, 4, 3>
- <4, 9, 5, 6, 4>
- <4, 6, 5, 9, 4>
- <5, 9, 4, 7, 5>
- <5, 7, 4, 9, 5>
- <6, 1, 9, 4, 6>
- <6, 4, 9, 1, 6>
- <7, 4, 9, 5, 7>
- <7, 5, 9, 4, 7>
- <8, 1, 9, 5, 8>
- <8, 5, 9, 1, 8>
- <9, 5, 3, 4, 9>
- <9, 4, 3, 5, 9>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle, we find the following chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 5, 9, 1, 0> has chord (1, 9)
- <1, 9, 5, 6, 1> has chord (5, 6)
- <2, 9, 5, 6, 2> has chord (5, 6)
- <3, 4, 9, 5, 3> has chord (4, 9)
- <4, 9, 5, 6, 4> has chord (5, 6)
- <5, 9, 4, 7, 5> has chord (4, 7)
- <6, 1, 9, 4, 6> has chord (1, 4)
- <7, 4, 9, 5, 7> has chord (4, 5)
- <8, 1, 9, 5, 8> has chord (1, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles, we have found 9 chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the final count is [9].
