Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 11, 1, 25, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 11, 1, 25, 0, 9, 2, 19, 6, 22, 17, 4, 7, 4>
- Cycle 3: <0, 11, 1, 25, 0, 9, 2, 19, 13, 12, 23, 22, 17, 4>
- Cycle 4: <0, 11, 1, 25, 0, 9, 2, 19, 13, 12, 28, 21, 14, 5, 18>
- Cycle 5: <0, 11, 1, 25, 0, 19, 6, 28, 21, 14, 5, 27, 26, 15>
- Cycle 6: <0, 11, 1, 25, 0, 19, 3, 17, 22, 23, 26, 27, 5, 18>
- Cycle 7: <9, 2, 19, 6, 28, 21, 14, 5, 27, 26, 16, 15>
- Cycle 8: <9, 2, 19, 6, 28, 21, 20, 3, 17, 22, 23, 26, 15>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 1: No chords
- Cycle 2: Chord (4, 22)
- Cycle 3: Chord (12, 6)
- Cycle 4: No chords
- Cycle 5: No chords
- Cycle 6: Chord (23, 22)
- Cycle 7: No chords
- Cycle 8: Chord (22, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 4 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [4].
