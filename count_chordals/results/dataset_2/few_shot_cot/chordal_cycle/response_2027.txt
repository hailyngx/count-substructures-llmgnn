Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 5, 6, 11, 4>
- <0, 5, 9, 2, 7>
- <0, 5, 9, 12, 4>
- <0, 1, 7, 4, 11>
- <0, 1, 8, 13, 4>
- <0, 1, 8, 13, 11>
- <0, 3, 5, 9, 12>
- <0, 3, 12, 6, 14>
- <0, 5, 9, 12, 6>
- <0, 5, 9, 12, 3>
- <1, 7, 2, 11, 6>
- <1, 8, 13, 3, 14>
- <2, 9, 5, 0, 1>
- <2, 7, 4, 11, 6>
- <2, 7, 4, 13, 11>
- <2, 7, 10, 12, 3>
- <3, 13, 4, 11, 6>
- <3, 13, 4, 7, 10>
- <3, 13, 8, 1, 0>
- <3, 14, 6, 5, 9>
- <3, 14, 10, 7, 4>
- <4, 11, 2, 7, 10>
- <4, 11, 2, 9, 5>
- <4, 7, 10, 12, 6>
- <4, 12, 9, 5, 6>
- <6, 11, 2, 0, 1>
- <7, 2, 9, 5, 6>
- <7, 2, 11, 4, 13>
- <10, 7, 4, 12, 6>
- <10, 12, 9, 5, 6>
- <11, 4, 7, 10, 14>
- <13, 4, 12, 6, 14>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 5, 9, 12, 4> has exactly one chord (9, 12).
- The cycle <0, 3, 5, 9, 12> has exactly one chord (5, 9).
- The cycle <1, 7, 2, 11, 6> has exactly one chord (7, 11).
- The cycle <2, 7, 10, 12, 3> has exactly one chord (7, 12).
- The cycle <3, 13, 8, 1, 0> has exactly one chord (8, 1).
- The cycle <4, 11, 2, 9, 5> has exactly one chord (11, 9).
- The cycle <10, 7, 4, 12, 6> has exactly one chord (7, 12).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].
