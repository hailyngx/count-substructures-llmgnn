Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with all edges existing:
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 17, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 4, 11, 18, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 15, 5, 19, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 10, 13, 1>
- Cycle 5: <3, 9, 14, 10, 3>
- Cycle 6: <3, 7, 10, 13, 3>
- Cycle 7: <4, 11, 18, 17, 4>
- Cycle 8: <5, 9, 14, 10, 5>
- Cycle 9: <5, 19, 0, 8, 5>
- Cycle 10: <6, 11, 18, 12, 6>
- Cycle 11: <7, 10, 13, 17, 7>
- Cycle 12: <9, 5, 15, 12, 9>
- Cycle 13: <12, 18, 17, 13, 12>
  
Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: <0, (6), 17, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: <1, (18), 11, 4, 1>
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: <1, (5), 19, 15, 1>
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: <1, (10), 13, 7, 1>
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: <3, (14), 10, 9, 3>
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: <3, (13), 10, 7, 3>
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: <4, (17), 18, 11, 4>
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: <5, (10), 14, 9, 5>
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: <5, (8), 0, 19, 5>
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: <6, (18), 11, 17, 6>
- Cycle 11 has 1 chord: <7, (13), 10, 17, 7>
- Cycle 12 has 1 chord: <9, (12), 18, 15, 9>
- Cycle 13 has 1 chord: <12, (17), 18, 13, 12>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph, therefore the count is [0].
