Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
1. <0, 5, 4, 7, 0>
2. <0, 5, 2, 1, 9, 7, 0>
3. <0, 5, 6, 9, 7, 0>
4. <0, 5, 6, 7, 0>
5. <1, 5, 9, 7, 1>
6. <1, 5, 2, 8, 3, 0, 1>
7. <2, 5, 6, 9, 2>
8. <3, 7, 9, 5, 6, 0, 3>
9. <4, 5, 9, 7, 4>
10. <6, 5, 9, 7, 6>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0,5,4,7,0> has chord (5,7)
- <0,5,2,1,9,7,0> has chord (2,9)
- <0,5,6,9,7,0> has chord (6,7)
- <0,5,6,7,0> has chord (5,7)
- <1,5,9,7,1> has chord (5,7)
- <1,5,2,8,3,0,1> has no chord
- <2,5,6,9,2> has chord (5,6)
- <3,7,9,5,6,0,3> has no chord
- <4,5,9,7,4> has chord (5,9)
- <6,5,9,7,6> has chord (5,7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found, we have [5].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0,5,4,7,0> with chord (5,7)
<0,5,2,1,9,7,0> with chord (2,9)
<0,5,6,9,7,0> with chord (6,7)
<4,5,9,7,4> with chord (5,9)
<6,5,9,7,6> with chord (5,7)
