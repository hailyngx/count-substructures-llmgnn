Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 8) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 2, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

1. Cycle: <0, 4, 5, 6>
2. Cycle: <0, 4, 7, 1>
3. Cycle: <1, 2, 5, 7>
4. Cycle: <1, 2, 6, 8>
5. Cycle: <1, 7, 4, 6>
6. Cycle: <1, 7, 8, 9>
7. Cycle: <2, 1, 7, 4>
8. Cycle: <2, 1, 9, 3>
9. Cycle: <2, 5, 4, 7>
10. Cycle: <3, 5, 2, 6>
11. Cycle: <3, 5, 4, 7>
12. Cycle: <4, 5, 2, 6>
13. Cycle: <4, 5, 7, 1>
14. Cycle: <5, 2, 1, 7>
15. Cycle: <5, 4, 7, 6>
16. Cycle: <6, 4, 7, 1>
17. Cycle: <6, 4, 5, 2>
18. Cycle: <7, 1, 2, 5>
19. Cycle: <7, 4, 6, 8>
20. Cycle: <8, 6, 4, 0>
21. Cycle: <8, 6, 7, 1>
22. Cycle: <8, 6, 7, 4>
23. Cycle: <8, 7, 4, 6>
24. Cycle: <8, 7, 1, 9>
25. Cycle: <9, 3, 5, 4>
26. Cycle: <9, 3, 5, 2>
27. Cycle: <9, 8, 7, 4>
28. Cycle: <9, 8, 7, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 4, 5, 6, (4, 5)>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 7, 4, 6, (1, 4)>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 7, 8, 9, (7, 9)>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, 1, 7, 4, (1, 4)>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, 5, 2, 6, (5, 6)>
Chordal 4-cycle found: <9, 8, 7, 4, (8, 4)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 28 cycles in total, and 6 of them are chordal 4-cycles. 
So, the number of chordless cycles is 28-6 = 22. 
Therefore, the final answer is [22].
