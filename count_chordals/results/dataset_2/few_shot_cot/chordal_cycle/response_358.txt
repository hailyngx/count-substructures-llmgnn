Response:
The number of chordless 4-cycles in the given graph is [6].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<9, 1, 12, 19> with chord (9, 19)
<10, 4, 16, 6> with chord (4, 6)
<8, 11, 17, 10> with chord (11, 17)
<5, 0, 6, 12> with chord (0, 12)
<1, 12, 14, 16> with chord (12, 16)
<5, 1, 9, 15> with chord (1, 15)
