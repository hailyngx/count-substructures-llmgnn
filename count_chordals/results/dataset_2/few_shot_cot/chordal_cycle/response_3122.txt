Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 2, 5, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 5, 1, 9>
- Cycle 3: <0, 8, 1, 9, 4>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 2, 4, 7>
- Cycle 7: <3, 7, 5, 2, 4>
- Cycle 8: <3, 1, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle 9: <5, 7, 4, 0, 6>
- Cycle 10: <5, 6, 8, 1, 3>
- Cycle 11: <7, 9, 6, 0, 4>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <4, 1>
- Cycle 2 has a chord <1, 9>
- Cycle 3 has a chord <0, 1>
- Cycle 4 has a chord <0, 7>
- Cycle 5 has a chord <1, 4>
- Cycle 6 has a chord <1, 2>
- Cycle 7 has a chord <3 ,5>
- Cycle 8 has a chord <1, 9>
- Cycle 9 has a chord <5, 6>
- Cycle 10 has a chord <1, 3>
- Cycle 11 has a chord <0, 9>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
