Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 3, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 10, 6, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 2, 12, 8, 4, 13, 7, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 6, 10, 7, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 6, 9, 1, 3, 8, 12, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 6, 9, 14, 13, 8, 3>
- Cycle 8: <5, 6, 9, 14, 13, 4, 8, 12, 5>
- Cycle 9: <7, 10, 6, 9, 14, 13, 12, 7>
- Cycle 10: <11, 7, 10, 6, 5, 11>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 6, 2, 0> - Chord: (9, 2)
- <0, 9, 3, 6, 0> - Chord: (9, 3)
- <1, 9, 6, 10, 7, 1> - Chord: (9, 10)
- <2, 6, 9, 1, 3, 8, 12, 2> - Chord: (6, 1)
- <3, 6, 9, 14, 13, 8, 3> - Chord: (6, 14)
- <7, 10, 6, 9, 14, 13, 12, 7> - Chord: (10, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- We found 4 chordless 4-cycles.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4]. The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<0, 9, 6, 2, 0>
<0, 9, 3, 6, 0>
<1, 9, 6, 10, 7, 1>
<2, 6, 9, 1, 3, 8, 12, 2>
