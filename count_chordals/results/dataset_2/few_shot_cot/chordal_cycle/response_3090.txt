Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <0, 8, 4, 2, 12, 1, 10>
        - <3, 9, 5, 2, 12, 1, 10>
        - <3, 4, 8, 14, 11, 15, 18>
        - <3, 10, 1, 12, 17, 18, 15>
        - <8, 4, 3, 9, 5, 13, 9>
        - <8, 14, 11, 15, 18, 17, 12>
        
Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <0, 8, 4, 2, 12, 1, 10> has chord (8, 12)
        - <3, 9, 5, 2, 12, 1, 10> has chord (9, 1)
        - <3, 4, 8, 14, 11, 15, 18> has chord (8, 15)
        - <3, 10, 1, 12, 17, 18, 15> has chord (1, 18)
        - <8, 4, 3, 9, 5, 13, 9> has chord (4, 13)
        - <8, 14, 11, 15, 18, 17, 12> has chord (14, 17)
        
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
        There are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the count is [0].
