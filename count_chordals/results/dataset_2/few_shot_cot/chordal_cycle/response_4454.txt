Response:
Step 1: 
- Potential chordal 4-cycles: 
  - Cycle 1: <0, 5, 2, 1, 0>
  - Cycle 2: <0, 5, 7, 3, 1, 0>
  - Cycle 3: <0, 6, 4, 2, 5, 0>
  - Cycle 4: <0, 7, 3, 8, 9, 5, 0>
  - Cycle 5: <0, 9, 8, 4, 6, 0>
  - Cycle 6: <1, 3, 7, 5, 2, 1>
  - Cycle 7: <2, 4, 8, 9, 7, 5, 2>
  - Cycle 8: <3, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3>
  - Cycle 9: <4, 6, 8, 3, 7, 5, 4>
  - Cycle 10: <5, 9, 8, 3, 7, 5>
  
Step 2:
- Checking for a chord in each cycle:
  - Cycle 1: <0, 5, 2, 1, 0> [Chord present: (5, 1)]
  - Cycle 2: <0, 5, 7, 3, 1, 0> [Chord present: (5, 1)]
  - Cycle 3: <0, 6, 4, 2, 5, 0> [Chord present: (6, 2)]
  - Cycle 4: <0, 7, 3, 8, 9, 5, 0> [Chord present: (7, 3)]
  - Cycle 5: <0, 9, 8, 4, 6, 0> [Chord present: (9, 4)]
  - Cycle 6: <1, 3, 7, 5, 2, 1> [Chord present: (3, 5)]
  - Cycle 7: <2, 4, 8, 9, 7, 5, 2> [Chord present: (4, 9)]
  - Cycle 8: <3, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3> [Chord present: (1, 4)]
  - Cycle 9: <4, 6, 8, 3, 7, 5, 4> [Chord present: (6, 3)]
  - Cycle 10: <5, 9, 8, 3, 7, 5> [Chord present: (9, 3)]

Step 3:
- Count of chordal 4-cycles: [10]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 5, 2, 1, 0> with chord (5, 1)
- <0, 5, 7, 3, 1, 0> with chord (5, 1)
- <0, 6, 4, 2, 5, 0> with chord (6, 2)
- <0, 7, 3, 8, 9, 5, 0> with chord (7, 3)
- <0, 9, 8, 4, 6, 0> with chord (9, 4)
- <1, 3, 7, 5, 2, 1> with chord (3, 5)
- <2, 4, 8, 9, 7, 5, 2> with chord (4, 9)
- <3, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3> with chord (1, 4)
- <4, 6, 8, 3, 7, 5, 4> with chord (6, 3)
- <5, 9, 8, 3, 7, 5> with chord (9, 3)
