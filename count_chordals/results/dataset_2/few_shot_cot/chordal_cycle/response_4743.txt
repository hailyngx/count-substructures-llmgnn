- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 1, 8, 4)
- Cycle 2: (4, 5, 6, 7, 4)
- Cycle 3: (4, 6, 7, 2, 4)
- Cycle 4: (4, 6, 0, 7, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 9, 8, 7, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 9, 2, 7, 4)
- Cycle 7: (6, 5, 4, 9, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 5, 1, 7, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 7, 3, 8, 6)
- Cycle 10: (0, 6, 7, 2, 0)
- Cycle 11: (0, 6, 5, 4, 0)
- Cycle 12: (0, 9, 8, 3, 0)
- Cycle 13: (1, 5, 4, 9, 1)

- Cycle 19: (3, 7, 2, 9, 3)
- Cycle 20: (3, 7, 6, 5, 3)
- Cycle 21: (3, 8, 1, 5, 3)

Step 2: Checking for the cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (4, 5, 1, 8, 4)  [No chord]
- Cycle 2: (4, 5, 6, 7, 4)  [Chord: (5, 7)]
- Cycle 3: (4, 6, 7, 2, 4)  [Chord: (6, 2)]
- Cycle 4: (4, 6, 0, 7, 4)  [Chord: (6, 0)]
- Cycle 5: (4, 9, 8, 7, 4)  [Chord: (9, 8)]
- Cycle 6: (4, 9, 2, 7, 4)  [Chord: (9, 2)]
- Cycle 8: (6, 5, 1, 7, 6)  [No chord]
- Cycle 9: (6, 7, 3, 8, 6)  [No chord]
- Cycle 10: (0, 6, 7, 2, 0)  [No chord]
- Cycle 11: (0, 6, 5, 4, 0)  [No chord]
- Cycle 13: (1, 5, 4, 9, 1)  [No chord]
- Cycle 14: (1, 5, 6, 7, 1)  [Chord: (5, 7)]
- Cycle 15: (1, 7, 2, 9, 1)  [Chord: (7, 9)]
- Cycle 16: (2, 4, 9, 8, 2)  [No chord]
- Cycle 17: (2, 4, 5, 6, 2)  [Chord: (4, 6)]
- Cycle 18: (2, 7, 1, 5, 2)  [No chord]
- Cycle 19: (3, 7, 2, 9, 3)  [No chord]
- Cycle 20: (3, 7, 6, 5, 3)  [Chord: (7, 5)]
- Cycle 21: (3, 8, 1, 5, 3)  [Chord: (8, 5)]

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 7 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<4, 5, 6, 7> with chord (5, 7)
<4, 6, 7, 2> with chord (6, 2)
<4, 6, 0, 7> with chord (6, 0)
<4, 9, 8, 7> with chord (9, 8)
<4, 9, 2, 7> with chord (9, 2)
<1, 5, 6, 7> with chord (5, 7)
<1, 7, 2, 9> with chord (7, 9)
