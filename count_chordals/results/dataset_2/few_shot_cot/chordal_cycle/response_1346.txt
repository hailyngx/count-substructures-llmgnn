Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 2, 13, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 2, 12, 6>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 2, 14, 1>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 11, 4, 8>
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 11, 8, 13>
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 2, 13, 5>
- Cycle 7: <3, 5, 8, 13, 4>
- Cycle 8: <3, 14, 9, 0, 5>
- Cycle 9: <3, 14, 9, 11, 4>
- Cycle 10: <6, 12, 2, 9, 0>
- Cycle 11: <7, 5, 0, 9, 11>
- Cycle 12: <7, 5, 8, 11, 0>
- Cycle 13: <7, 5, 13, 4, 11>
- Cycle 14: <8, 6, 12, 2, 10>
- Cycle 15: <8, 6, 12, 2, 13>
- Cycle 16: <10, 12, 6, 5, 3>
- Cycle 17: <11, 9, 2, 13, 5>
- Cycle 18: <11, 9, 2, 12, 6>
- Cycle 19: <11, 4, 7, 5, 8>
- Cycle 20: <13, 4, 7, 5, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 2, 13, 4> has chord (2, 13)
- <0, 9, 2, 12, 6> has chord (2, 6)
- <0, 9, 2, 14, 1> has chord (2, 14)
- <0, 9, 11, 4, 8> has chord (9, 11)
- <0, 9, 11, 8, 13> has chord (9, 11)
- <1, 9, 2, 13, 5> has chord (9, 5)
- <3, 5, 8, 13, 4> has chord (5, 8)
- <3, 14, 9, 0, 5> has chord (9, 5)
- <3, 14, 9, 11, 4> has chord (9, 4)
- <6, 12, 2, 9, 0> has chord (12, 9)
- <7, 5, 0, 9, 11> has chord (5, 9)
- <7, 5, 8, 11, 0> has chord (8, 11)
- <7, 5, 13, 4, 11> has chord (5, 4)
- <8, 6, 12, 2, 10> has chord (6, 12)
- <8, 6, 12, 2, 13> has chord (6, 12)
- <10, 12, 6, 5, 3> has chord (12, 6)
- <11, 9, 2, 13, 5> has chord (9, 13)
- <11, 9, 2, 12, 6> has chord (9, 12)
- <11, 4, 7, 5, 8> has chord (7, 8)
- <13, 4, 7, 5, 0> has chord (4, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordal 4-cycles in this graph, so the answer is [0].
