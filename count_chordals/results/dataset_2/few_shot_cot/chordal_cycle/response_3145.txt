- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 8, 13>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 8, 13, 6, 10>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 8, 13, 6, 17>
- Cycle 5: <0, 7, 18, 2, 13>
- Cycle 6: <0, 7, 18, 2, 13, 6, 17>
- Cycle 7: <0, 15, 13, 8, 1>
- Cycle 8: <0, 15, 13, 6, 10>
- Cycle 9: <1, 8, 13, 2, 18>

- Cycle 21: <10, 6, 17, 14, 9>
- Cycle 22: <13, 6, 10, 9>

Step 2:
The cycles with a single chord corresponding to chordal 4-cycles are:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <0, 1, (12, 16)>
- Chordal Cycle 2: <0, 1, 8, (13, 6), 10>
- Chordal Cycle 3: <0, 1, 8, (13, 6), 17>
- Chordal Cycle 4: <0, 7, 18, (2, 13), 6, 17>
- Chordal Cycle 5: <0, 15, 13, (8, 1)>
- Chordal Cycle 6: <1, 12, 16, 14, (9, 10)>
- Chordal Cycle 7: <4, 9, 14, (16, 12)>
- Chordal Cycle 8: <10, 6, 17, 14, (9, 14)>

Step 3:
There are a total of [8] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
