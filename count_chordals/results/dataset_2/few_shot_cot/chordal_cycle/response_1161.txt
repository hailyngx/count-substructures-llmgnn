Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 7>  
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 17, 2>  
- Cycle 3: <0, 18, 6, 5>  
- Cycle 4: <0, 18, 6, 11>  
- Cycle 5: <0, 18, 14, 1>  
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 12, 16>  
- Cycle 7: <1, 7, 11, 5>  
- Cycle 8: <1, 14, 8, 3>  
- Cycle 9: <2, 16, 12, 4>  
- Cycle 10: <2, 16, 19, 10>  
- Cycle 11: <2, 3, 8, 14>  
- Cycle 12: <3, 2, 17, 4>  
- Cycle 13: <4, 17, 11, 5>  
- Cycle 14: <4, 1, 13, 16>  
- Cycle 15: <5, 6, 18, 11>  
- Cycle 16: <6, 18, 14, 1>  
- Cycle 17: <7, 12, 16, 19>  
- Cycle 18: <8, 14, 18, 17>  
- Cycle 19: <10, 19, 16, 12>  
- Cycle 20: <11, 7, 12, 16>  
- Cycle 21: <11, 18, 14, 1>  
- Cycle 22: <13, 1, 14, 8>  
- Cycle 23: <16, 12, 7, 19>  
- Cycle 24: <16, 13, 15, 13>  
- Cycle 25: <17, 2, 3, 8>  
- Cycle 26: <17, 11, 5, 6>  
- Cycle 27: <17, 18, 11, 5>  
- Cycle 28: <18, 0, 10, 19>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
- <1, 7, 12, 16> has exactly one chord: (1, 16)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
There is 27 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count of the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
