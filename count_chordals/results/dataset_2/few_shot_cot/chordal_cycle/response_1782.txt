Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycle <0, 4, 8, 5, 11> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <0, 4, 8, 12, 9> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <0, 1, 6, 14, 11> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <0, 1, 6, 14, 3> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <0, 1, 10, 14, 3> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <0, 1, 10, 8, 4> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <0, 11, 14, 3, 7> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <0, 11, 14, 12, 9> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <0, 14, 6, 1, 10> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <0, 14, 6, 11, 5> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <0, 14, 12, 9, 7> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <0, 13, 9, 7, 3> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <0, 13, 9, 12, 8> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <2, 5, 8, 4, 0> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <2, 5, 11, 14, 3> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <2, 5, 11, 6, 1> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <2, 7, 3, 14, 6> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <2, 7, 10, 8, 4> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <2, 7, 10, 1, 6> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <2, 12, 8, 4, 0> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <2, 12, 8, 10, 1> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <3, 7, 9, 13, 0> forms a 4-cycle. 
- The cycle <3, 7, 10, 8, 4> forms a 4-cycle. 

Step 2:
- Out of the cycles listed above, <0, 4, 8, 5, 11> has a chord 8-5.
- Additionally, <0, 1, 6, 14, 11> has a chord 14-6.

Therefore, the chordal 4-cycles in the graph are [<2>].
