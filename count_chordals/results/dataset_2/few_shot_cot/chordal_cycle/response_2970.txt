Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph can be represented as <4, 10, 11, 5> with the chord (10, 5) inside the brackets. 

Following the steps mentioned earlier:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle <4, 10, 11, 5>
- Cycle <4, 10, 13, 7>
- Cycle <4, 17, 19, 13>
- Cycle <4, 17, 2, 12>
- Cycle <4, 14, 16, 15>
- Cycle <7, 12, 2, 6>
- Cycle <7, 12, 9, 15>
- Cycle <7, 13, 19, 17>
- Cycle <7, 8, 17, 19>
- Cycle <10, 11, 5, 1>
- Cycle <10, 13, 1, 5>
- Cycle <10, 9, 15, 16>
- Cycle <11, 8, 17, 2>
- Cycle <11, 8, 7, 12>
- Cycle <12, 9, 15, 18>
- Cycle <13, 7, 12, 2>
- Cycle <13, 19, 17, 8>
- Cycle <14, 16, 15, 9>
- Cycle <14, 5, 1, 13>
- Cycle <17, 2, 19, 13>
  
Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Only <4, 10, 11, 5> has exactly one chord (10, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
- Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
