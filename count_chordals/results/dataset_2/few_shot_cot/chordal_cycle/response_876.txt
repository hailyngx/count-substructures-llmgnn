Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
  1. <0, 6, 4, 9, 2, 5>
  2. <0, 6, 4, 13, 1, 10>
  3. <0, 6, 5, 12, 14, 8>
  4. <1, 10, 3, 4, 9, 13>
  5. <1, 10, 11, 14, 8, 7>
  6. <2, 5, 12, 11, 10, 3>
  7. <2, 5, 8, 7, 1, 0>
  8. <2, 7, 12, 5, 6, 0>
  9. <2, 7, 1, 13, 4, 9>
  10. <2, 9, 10, 3, 4, 6>
  11. <2, 9, 13, 12, 7, 8>

  2. <2, (5, 12), 7>
  3. <2, (7, 12), 5>
  4. <3, (10, 14), 1>
  5. <4, (4, 13), 9>
  6. <5, (2, 8), 7>
  7. <9, (10, 13), 4>
  8. <10, (1, 7), 13>
  9. <11, (10, 14), 12>
  10. <12, (11, 3), 13>
