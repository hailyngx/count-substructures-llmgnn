Response:
Step 1: 
- There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. These include:
1. <1, 3, 5, 12>
2. <1, 3, 11, 13>
3. <1, 4, 6, 10>
4. <1, 4, 7, 12>
5. <1, 4, 12, 9>
6. <1, 5, 10, 6>
7. <1, 5, 11, 3>
8. <1, 8, 2, 0>
9. <2, 8, 7, 4>
10. <3, 1, 4, 6>
11. <3, 4, 1, 8>
12. <3, 4, 12, 5>
13. <3, 5, 11, 6>
14. <4, 6, 11, 13>
15. <4, 7, 12, 9>
16. <4, 12, 9, 10>
17. <5, 1, 4, 7>
18. <5, 3, 1, 8>
19. <5, 3, 4, 7>
20. <5, 10, 6, 11>
21. <8, 1, 4, 7>
22. <8, 2, 0, 9>
23. <9, 12, 4, 7>
24. <9, 13, 11, 6>
25. <10, 6, 11, 13>
26. <10, 6, 4, 7>
27. <11, 3, 5, 12>
28. <11, 5, 1, 8>
29. <11, 6, 4, 7>
30. <11, 14, 2, 8>
31. <12, 4, 6, 11>
32. <12, 7, 4, 6>
33. <12, 9, 13, 14>
34. <13, 9, 12, 7>
35. <14, 2, 8, 1>
36. <14, 10, 6, 4>
37. <14, 11, 3, 5>

Step 2:
- From the above cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <1, 3, 5, 12> with chord (3, 5)
2. <3, 4, 1, 8> with chord (4, 1)
3. <3, 4, 12, 5> with chord (4, 5)
4. <1, 5, 11, 3> with chord (5, 11)
5. <5, 10, 6, 11> with chord (10, 6)
6. <11, 14, 2, 8> with chord (14, 2)
7. <13, 9, 12, 7> with chord (9, 12)
8. <14, 2, 8, 1> with chord (2, 8)

Step 3:
- There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [8].
