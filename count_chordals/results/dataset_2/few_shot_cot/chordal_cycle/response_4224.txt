Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 4> with edges (0, 5), (5, 1), (1, 4), (4, 0)
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 7, 2> with edges (0, 8), (8, 7), (7, 2), (2, 0)
- Cycle 3: <1, 5, 3, 15> with edges (1, 5), (5, 3), (3, 15), (15, 1)
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 9, 13> with edges (1, 5), (5, 9), (9, 13), (13, 1)
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 15, 3> with edges (1, 4), (4, 15), (15, 3), (3, 1)
- Cycle 6: <2, 16, 11, 7> with edges (2, 16), (16, 11), (11, 7), (7, 2)
- Cycle 7: <2, 7, 8, 5> with edges (2, 7), (7, 8), (8, 5), (5, 2)
- Cycle 8: <5, 9, 13, 17> with edges (5, 9), (9, 13), (13, 17), (17, 5)
- Cycle 9: <5, 8, 7, 2> with edges (5, 8), (8, 7), (7, 2), (2, 5)
- Cycle 10: <13, 11, 16, 17> with edges (13, 11), (11, 16), (16, 17), (17, 13)
- Cycle 11: <13, 9, 5, 1> with edges (13, 9), (9, 5), (5, 1), (1, 13)
- Cycle 12: <13, 19, 14, 15> with edges (13, 19), (19, 14), (14, 15), (15, 13)
- Cycle 13: <15, 3, 5, 9> with edges (15, 3), (3, 5), (5, 9), (9, 15)
- Cycle 14: <15, 14, 19, 13> with edges (15, 14), (14, 19), (19, 13), (13, 15)
- Cycle 15: <16, 11, 4, 1> with edges (16, 11), (11, 4), (4, 1), (1, 16)

- Cycle 17: <19, 14, 15, 3> with edges (19, 14), (14, 15), (15, 3), (3, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 1, 4> has chord (5, 1)
- <0, 8, 7, 2> has chord (8, 7)
- <1, 5, 3, 15> has chord (5, 3)
- <1, 5, 9, 13> has chord (5, 13)
- <2, 16, 11, 7> has chord (16, 7)
- <13, 9, 5, 1> has chord (9, 1)
- <15, 14, 19, 13> has chord (14, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 10 chordless 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 5, 1, 4> with one chord (5, 1)
- <0, 8, 7, 2> with one chord (8, 7)
- <1, 5, 3, 15> with one chord (5, 3)
- <1, 5, 9, 13> with one chord (5, 13)
- <2, 16, 11, 7> with one chord (16, 7)
- <13, 9, 5, 1> with one chord (9, 1)
- <15, 14, 19, 13> with one chord (14, 13)
