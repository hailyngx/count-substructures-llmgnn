Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, but not all of them have all edges present. Therefore, we need to find the cycles with all edges present. Let's list them with their edges:
1. <0, 2, 18, 13> with edges (0, 2), (2, 18), (18, 13), (13, 0)
2. <0, 18, 28, 24> with edges (0, 18), (18, 28), (28, 24), (24, 0)
3. <2, 18, 13, 14> with edges (2, 18), (18, 13), (13, 14), (14, 2)
4. <4, 23, 0, 18> with edges (4, 23), (23, 0), (0, 18), (18, 4)
5. <4, 22, 17, 29> with edges (4, 22), (22, 17), (17, 29), (29, 4)
6. <7, 3, 6, 14> with edges (7, 3), (3, 6), (6, 14), (14, 7)
7. <7, 8, 15, 8> with edges (7, 8), (8, 15), (15, 8), (8, 7)
8. <11, 10, 9, 1> with edges (11, 10), (10, 9), (9, 1), (1, 11)
9. <11, 13, 14, 6> with edges (11, 13), (13, 14), (14, 6), (6, 11)
10. <11, 27, 17, 29> with edges (11, 27), (27, 17), (17, 29), (29, 11)
11. <18, 28, 21, 5> with edges (18, 28), (28, 21), (21, 5), (5, 18)
12. <22, 17, 27, 11> with edges (22, 17), (17, 27), (27, 11), (11, 22)
13. <22, 24, 1, 9> with edges (22, 24), (24, 1), (1, 9), (9, 22)
14. <25, 22, 17, 29> with edges (25, 22), (22, 17), (17, 29), (29, 25)
15. <28, 18, 13, 11> with edges (28, 18), (18, 13), (13, 11), (11, 28)
16. <29, 25, 11, 27> with edges (29, 25), (25, 11), (11, 27), (27, 29)

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the cycles with exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle) are:
- <18, 13, (0, 2), 14>
- <22, 17, (4, 29), 25>

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [14].
