Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 19, 9, 4, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 12, 13, 10, 4>
- Cycle 3: <0, 8, 12, 18, 17, 11>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 2, 1>
- Cycle 5: <0, 5, 2, 1>
- Cycle 6: <0, 5, 6, 9, 4>
- Cycle 7: <0, 12, 18, 15, 4>
- Cycle 8: <0, 12, 18, 17, 11>
- Cycle 9: <1, 2, 5, 6, 9>
- Cycle 10: <4, 7, 16, 15, 18>
- Cycle 11: <4, 9, 6, 5, 0>
- Cycle 12: <4, 10, 13, 12, 8>
- Cycle 13: <4, 10, 14, 6, 5>
- Cycle 14: <4, 14, 6, 5, 2>
- Cycle 15: <4, 15, 18, 17, 11>
- Cycle 16: <6, 9, 19, 11, 17>
- Cycle 17: <6, 14, 10, 13, 12>
- Cycle 18: <10, 13, 12, 18, 15>
- Cycle 19: <10, 18, 17, 11, 19>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 8, 12, 13, 10> with chord (8, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <6, 9, 19, 11, 17> with chord (9, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <10, 13, 12, 18, 15> with chord (13, 18)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 16.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
