Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <0, 10, 24, 4>, with a non-adjacent chord (12, 13).

Steps to finding the chordless cycles:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
   - Cycle 1: 0, 10, 24, 4, 12 (length 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
   - Cycle 1 has one chord (12, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
   - There are 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
