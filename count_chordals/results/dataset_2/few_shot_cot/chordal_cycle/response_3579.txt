Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- <0, 1, 2, 3, 4>
- <0, 1, 2, 3, 7>
- <0, 1, 2, 4, 7>
- <0, 1, 6, 9, 5>
- <0, 1, 6, 9, 3>
- <0, 1, 8, 7, 4>
- <0, 2, 3, 7, 4>
- <0, 2, 3, 5, 9>
- <0, 2, 4, 7, 8>
- <0, 2, 4, 5, 9>
- <0, 2, 1, 8, 7>
- <1, 0, 2, 4, 5>
- <1, 0, 2, 4, 7>
- <1, 0, 2, 3, 7>
- <1, 2, 3, 5, 9>
- <1, 2, 3, 7, 8>
- <2, 0, 1, 6, 9>
- <2, 0, 1, 8, 7>
- <2, 0, 1, 6, 9>
- <2, 3, 4, 7, 8>
- <3, 5, 4, 7, 8>
- <4, 5, 9, 6, 1>
- <4, 7, 3, 5, 9>
- <5, 9, 6, 0, 2>
- <6, 9, 0, 1, 8>
- <7, 4, 2, 0, 1>
- <8, 1, 6, 9, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 2, 3, 4> (Chord: (0, 4))
- <0, 1, 6, 9, 5> (Chord: (1, 5))
- <0, 1, 8, 7, 4> (Chord: (1, 7))
- <1, 0, 2, 4, 5> (Chord: (0, 5))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
- There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [4].
