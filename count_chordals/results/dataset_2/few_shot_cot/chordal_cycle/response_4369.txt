Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 3, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 2, 9, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 6, 2, 9, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 4, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 4, 3, 1, 5)
- Cycle 7: (9, 2, 6, 7, 9)
- Cycle 8: (9, 2, 1, 5, 9)
- Cycle 9: (1, 3, 8, 9, 1)
- Cycle 10: (3, 0, 2, 6, 3)
- Cycle 11: (3, 4, 6, 0, 3)
- Cycle 12: (6, 7, 2, 0, 6)
- Cycle 13: (7, 8, 9, 5, 7)
- Cycle 14: (7, 0, 6, 4, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <1, (2, 6), 5>, Chord: (2, 6) in Cycle 2
- <5, (1, 9), 7>, Chord: (1, 9) in Cycle 1
- <5, (1, 3), 7>, Chord: (1, 3) in Cycle 2
- <5, (7, 2), 9>, Chord: (7, 2) in Cycle 3
- <5, (7, 6), 9>, Chord: (7, 6) in Cycle 4
- <5, (4, 6), 7>, Chord: (4, 6) in Cycle 5
- <5, (4, 3), 7>, Chord: (4, 3) in Cycle 6
- <9, (2, 6), 1>, Chord: (2, 6) in Cycle 7
- <9, (2, 1), 5>, Chord: (2, 1) in Cycle 8
- <1, (3, 8), 9>, Chord: (3, 8) in Cycle 9
- <3, (0, 6), 2>, Chord: (0, 6) in Cycle 10
- <3, (4, 6), 0>, Chord: (4, 6) in Cycle 11

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [4].
