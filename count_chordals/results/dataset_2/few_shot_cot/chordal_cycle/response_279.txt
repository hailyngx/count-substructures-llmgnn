Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are:

Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- <0, 9, 15, 4>
- <0, 9, 15, 11>
- <0, 12, 1, 5>
- <0, 12, 1, 13>

Step 2: Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 15, 4> has one chord: (0, 15)
- <0, 9, 15, 11> has one chord: (0, 15)
- <0, 12, 1, 5> has one chord: (12, 5)
- <0, 12, 1, 13> has one chord: (12, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
