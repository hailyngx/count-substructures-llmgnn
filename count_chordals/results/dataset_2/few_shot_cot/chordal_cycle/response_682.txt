Response:
Let's identify the chordal 4-cycles in this graph step-by-step:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (0, 9, 6, 5, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 9, 2, 8, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 9, 2, 12, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 1, 4, 7, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 1, 12, 6, 0)
- Cycle 6: (0, 3, 6, 5, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 3, 10, 4, 0)
- Cycle 8: (0, 3, 10, 8, 0)
- Cycle 9: (0, 5, 6, 9, 0)
- Cycle 10: (0, 5, 14, 13, 0)
- Cycle 11: (0, 7, 4, 10, 0)
- Cycle 12: (0, 7, 13, 11, 0)
- Cycle 13: (1, 4, 10, 8, 1)
- Cycle 14: (1, 4, 11, 12, 1)
- Cycle 15: (1, 5, 6, 9, 1)
- Cycle 16: (1, 5, 14, 13, 1)
- Cycle 17: (2, 9, 6, 5, 2)
- Cycle 18: (2, 9, 0, 7, 2)
- Cycle 19: (3, 6, 9, 0, 3)
- Cycle 20: (3, 6, 5, 7, 3)
- Cycle 21: (3, 10, 4, 7, 3)
- Cycle 22: (4, 7, 0, 1, 4)
- Cycle 23: (4, 7, 13, 11, 4)
- Cycle 24: (5, 6, 9, 0, 5)
- Cycle 25: (5, 6, 12, 1, 5)
- Cycle 26: (6, 9, 2, 8, 6)
- Cycle 27: (6, 9, 0, 3, 6)
- Cycle 28: (7, 4, 1, 12, 7)
- Cycle 29: (7, 4, 11, 13, 7)
- Cycle 30: (8, 2, 9, 0, 8)
- Cycle 31: (8, 2, 12, 11, 8)
- Cycle 32: (10, 4, 1, 12, 10)
- Cycle 33: (10, 8, 2, 12, 10)
- Cycle 34: (11, 4, 1, 12, 11)
- Cycle 35: (11, 4, 7, 13, 11)
- Cycle 36: (12, 6, 9, 0, 12)
- Cycle 37: (12, 6, 5, 14, 12)
- Cycle 38: (13, 7, 4, 10, 13)
- Cycle 39: (13, 7, 0, 9, 13)
- Cycle 40: (14, 5, 6, 9, 14)
- Cycle 41: (14, 5, 0, 7, 14)

Step 2: Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 13: (1, 4, 10, 8, 1)   Chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 14: (1, 4, 11, 12, 1)   Chord: (4, 12)
- Cycle 23: (4, 7, 13, 11, 4)   Chord: (7, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles: [38]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<1, 4, 10, 8, 1>
<1, 4, 11, 12, 1>
<4, 7, 13, 11, 4>
