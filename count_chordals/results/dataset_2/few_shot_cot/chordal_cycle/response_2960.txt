Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 5, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 1, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, 5, 6, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 2, 8, 6, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 5, 7, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 5, 7, 6, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 8, 6, 2>
- Cycle 9: <5, 6, 7, 9, 5>
- Cycle 10: <5, 7, 4, 9, 5>
- Cycle 11: <6, 5, 9, 7, 6>
- Cycle 12: <7, 5, 9, 7, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal Cycle 1: <0, 9, (2), 5, (0)>
- Chordal Cycle 2: <0, 9, (1), 2, (0)>
- Chordal Cycle 3: <0, 9, (1), 6, (0)>
- Chordal Cycle 4: <1, 2, (5), 6, (1)>
- Chordal Cycle 5: <1, 2, (8), 6, (1)>
- Chordal Cycle 6: <1, 9, (5), 7, (1)>
- Chordal Cycle 7: <2, 5, (7), 6, (2)>
- Chordal Cycle 8: <2, 5, (8), 6, (2)>
- Chordal Cycle 9: <5, 6, (7), 9, (5)>
- Chordal Cycle 10: <5, 7, (4), 9, (5)>
- Chordal Cycle 11: <6, 5, (9), 7, (6)>
- Chordal Cycle 12: <7, 5, (9), 7, (7)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

There are no chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.
