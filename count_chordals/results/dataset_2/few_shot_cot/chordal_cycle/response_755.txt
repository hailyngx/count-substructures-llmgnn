Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <0, 6, 9, 4>
2. <0, 6, 11, 3>
3. <0, 7, 12, 5>
4. <1, 8, 10, 2>
5. <2, 10, 9, 4>
6. <3, 9, 4, 5>
7. <4, 5, 8, 10>
8. <5, 8, 1, 0>
9. <6, 9, 4, 11>
10. <7, 6, 9, 3>
11. <7, 12, 5, 8>
12. <9, 4, 14, 2>
13. <9, 6, 7, 0>
14. <10, 2, 14, 13>
15. <11, 6, 7, 0>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 6, 9, 4, (11, 3)>
- <0, 7, 12, 5, (6, 2)>
- <1, 8, 10, 2, (9, 4)>
- <2, 10, 9, 4, (14, 13)>
- <3, 9, 4, 5, (12, 11)>
- <4, 5, 8, 10, (9, 2)>
- <5, 8, 1, 0, (12, 11)>
- <6, 9, 4, 11, (7, 0)>
- <7, 6, 9, 3, (0, 2)>
- <9, 4, 14, 2, (6, 10)>

Step 3:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [10].
