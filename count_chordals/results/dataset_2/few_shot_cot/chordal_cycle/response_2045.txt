Response:
Let's go through the steps to find the number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring every edge in the cycle exists.
- The cycles of length 4 in this graph are:
1. (4, 7, 6, 5, 4)
2. (4, 7, 13, 8, 4)
3. (4, 9, 2, 5, 4)
4. (4, 11, 1, 8, 4)
5. (7, 13, 8, 1, 7)
6. (7, 6, 5, 13, 7)
7. (8, 13, 5, 6, 8)
8. (13, 7, 6, 14, 13)
9. (13, 8, 1, 14, 13)
10. (5, 6, 7, 4, 5)
11. (5, 2, 9, 4, 5)
12. (6, 7, 4, 11, 6)
13. (6, 5, 2, 9, 6)
14. (2, 9, 11, 4, 2)
15. (2, 5, 6, 7, 2)
16. (1, 8, 13, 7, 1)
17. (1, 11, 9, 4, 1)
18. (3, 10, 6, 7, 3)
19. (3, 14, 13, 8, 3)
20. (0, 6, 7, 3, 0)
21. (0, 13, 8, 1, 0)
22. (9, 2, 5, 12, 9)
23. (9, 11, 4, 7, 9)
24. (11, 12, 5, 2, 11)
25. (11, 1, 8, 13, 11)
26. (12, 9, 11, 1, 12)
27. (12, 5, 6, 10, 12)
28. (10, 3, 14, 13, 10)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The chordal 4-cycle with a single chord is: 
    - <4, 7, 13, 8, 4> with chord (7, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 27 unique chordal 4-cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
