Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 12, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 5, 13, 12, 4>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 11, 14, 13, 4>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 11, 13, 12, 4>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 5, 3, 9, 4>
- Cycle 6: <0, 14, 13, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle 7: <0, 14, 13, 12, 4>
- Cycle 8: <0, 9, 4, 13, 14, 11>
- Cycle 9: <1, 7, 4, 13, 11, 6>
- Cycle 10: <1, 9, 3, 5, 6, 2>
- Cycle 11: <2, 7, 3, 5, 6>
- Cycle 12: <2, 6, 5, 13, 14>
- Cycle 13: <3, 7, 2, 6, 5>
- Cycle 14: <3, 7, 2, 14, 13>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 6, 5, 13, 12, 4>, Chord: (6, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 6, 11, 13, 12, 4>, Chord: (6, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 7, 4, 13, 11, 6>, Chord: (7, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 14, 13, 12, 4>, Chord: (14, 12)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

- The number of chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord: [4]
