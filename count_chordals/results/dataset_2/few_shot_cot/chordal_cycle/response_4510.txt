Step 2: Check for cycles with one chord:
- Chordal cycle found: <<3, 7, 14, 5>, (1, 6)>
- Chordal cycle found: <<3, 2, 4, 12>, (7, 14)>
- Chordal cycle found: <<5, 1, 8, 14>, (10, 6)>
- Chordal cycle found: <<5, 10, 6, 1>, (0, 2)>
- Chordal cycle found: <<6, 1, 8, 14>, (7, 3)>
- Chordal cycle found: <<7, 3, 2, 4>, (11, 12)>
- Chordal cycle found: <<10, 5, 1, 12>, (6, 4)>
- Chordal cycle found: <<10, 6, 7, 3>, (13, 12)>
- Chordal cycle found: <<12, 4, 14, 7>, (10, 1)>
- Chordal cycle found: <<13, 6, 12, 4>, (7, 3)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are [10] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
