Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 6) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- (1, 3, 7, 9)
- (1, 3, 8, 2)
- (1, 3, 0, 9)
- (1, 6, 9, 7)
- (1, 6, 9, 2)
- (1, 6, 5, 4)
- (1, 6, 5, 4)
- (1, 5, 4, 8)
- (3, 7, 9, 6)
- (3, 7, 9, 2)
- (3, 7, 8, 2)
- (3, 2, 8, 4)
- (4, 8, 3, 1)
- (4, 8, 3, 7)
- (4, 8, 7, 9)
- (5, 1, 6, 9)
- (5, 1, 6, 2)
- (6, 9, 7, 3)
- (6, 9, 7, 8)
- (6, 9, 7, 3)
- (6, 9, 7, 3)
- (6, 2, 8, 4)
- (6, 2, 8, 3)
- (6, 2, 8, 7)
- (7, 9, 0, 1)
- (8, 4, 5, 6)
- (8, 4, 5, 6)
- (9, 7, 3, 1)
- (9, 7, 3, 0)
- (9, 7, 3, 8)
- (9, 6, 1, 3)
- (9, 6, 1, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
- <1, (3, 9), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [31] chordless cycles in the graph.
