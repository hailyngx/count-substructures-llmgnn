Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1: 1-5-9-3-1
2. Cycle 2: 2-5-9-3-2
3. Cycle 3: 4-6-5-9-4
4. Cycle 4: 5-1-7-4-5
5. Cycle 5: 5-1-2-5
6. Cycle 6: 5-9-3-4-5
7. Cycle 7: 6-5-9-3-6
8. Cycle 8: 7-1-5-9-7

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, (9, 3), 5>
2. <2, (5, 9), 3>
3. <4, (6, 9), 5>
4. <5, (1, 7), 9>
5. <6, (5, 3), 9>
6. <7, (1, 5), 9>
7. <8, (5, 3), 6>

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [7].
