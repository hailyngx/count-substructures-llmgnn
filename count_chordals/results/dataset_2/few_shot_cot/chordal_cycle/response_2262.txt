Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 13, 1, 7, 17, 12> with edges (0, 13), (13, 1), (1, 7), (7, 17), (17, 12), (12, 0)
- Cycle 2: <0, 13, 19, 6, 18, 15> with edges (0, 13), (13, 19), (19, 6), (6, 18), (18, 15), (15, 0)
- Cycle 3: <4, 7, 17, 12, 2, 14> with edges (4, 7), (7, 17), (17, 12), (12, 2), (2, 14), (14, 4)
- Cycle 4: <3, 16, 11, 12, 0, 13> with edges (3, 16), (16, 11), (11, 12), (12, 0), (0, 13), (13, 3)
- Cycle 5: <6, 18, 15, 4, 3, 9> with edges (6, 18), (18, 15), (15, 4), (4, 3), (3, 9), (9, 6)
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 4, 3, 19, 13> with edges (1, 7), (7, 4), (4, 3), (3, 19), (19, 13), (13, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has chords <16, 14>.
- Cycle 5 has chords <9, 17>.
- Cycle 6 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are <0, 13, 1, 7, 17, 12>, <0, 13, 19, 6, 18, 15>, and <1, 7, 4, 3, 19, 13> as the chordless cycles, so the count is [3].
