The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <1, 5, 9, 7>
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 4, 7>
- Cycle 3: <1, 9, 7, 4>
- Cycle 4: <4, 7, 9, 5>
- Cycle 5: <6, 1, 5, 4>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 4, 7>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 0, 6>
- Cycle 8: <1, 3, 0, 8>
- Cycle 9: <1, 4, 3, 0>
- Cycle 10: <4, 7, 6, 2>
- Cycle 11: <7, 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle 12: <7, 6, 2, 5>
- Cycle 13: <0, 3, 4, 7>
- Cycle 14: <0, 8, 4, 7>
- Cycle 15: <4, 5, 2, 6>
- Cycle 16: <2, 5, 8, 0>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 5 has no chords
- Cycle 6 has no chords
- Cycle 7 has no chords
- Cycle 8 has no chords
- Cycle 9 has no chords
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (5, 2)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (6, 2)
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (1, 5)
- Cycle 13 has no chords
- Cycle 14 has no chords
- Cycle 15 has no chords
- Cycle 16 has one chord: (2, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- Cycle 5: <6, 1, 5, 4>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 4, 7>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 0, 6>
- Cycle 8: <1, 3, 0, 8>
