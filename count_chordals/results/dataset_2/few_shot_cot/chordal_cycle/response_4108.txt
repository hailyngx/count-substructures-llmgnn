Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 16, 6, 8, 2, 5, 9, 18, 4> (length 9)
- Cycle <0, 16, 8, 15, 7, 13, 5, 2> (length 8)
- Cycle <0, 16, 8, 12, 1, 14, 11, 4> (length 8)
- Cycle <0, 16, 8, 12, 1, 4, 18, 13> (length 8)
- Cycle <0, 16, 8, 12, 1, 4, 17, 5> (length 8)
- Cycle <0, 16, 8, 12, 3, 1, 14, 11> (length 8)
- Cycle <0, 16, 6, 8, 12, 1, 14, 11> (length 8)
- Cycle <0, 16, 6, 8, 12, 3, 1, 14> (length 8)
- Cycle <0, 16, 6, 8, 15, 7, 13, 18> (length 8)
- Cycle <0, 16, 6, 8, 15, 7, 13, 5> (length 8)
- Cycle <0, 16, 8, 15, 7, 13, 18, 9> (length 8)
- Cycle <0, 16, 8, 15, 7, 13, 18, 4> (length 8)
- Cycle <0, 16, 8, 12, 3, 1, 4, 18> (length 8)
- Cycle <0, 16, 8, 12, 3, 1, 4, 17> (length 8)
- Cycle <0, 16, 8, 12, 1, 4, 17, 12> (length 8)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 16, 6, 8, 2, 5, 9, 18, 4> has chord (5, 18)
- <0, 16, 8, 15, 7, 13, 5, 2> has chord (7, 13)
- <0, 16, 8, 12, 1, 14, 11, 4> has chord (1, 4)
- <0, 16, 8, 12, 1, 4, 18, 13> has chord (1, 4)
- <0, 16, 8, 12, 1, 4, 17, 5> has chord (1, 4)
- <0, 16, 8, 12, 3, 1, 14, 11> has chord (1, 14)
- <0, 16, 6, 8, 12, 1, 14, 11> has chord (1, 14)
- <0, 16, 6, 8, 12, 3, 1, 14> has chord (1, 14)
- <0, 16, 8, 15, 7, 13, 18, 9> has chord (7, 13)
- <0, 16, 8, 15, 7, 13, 18, 4> has chord (7, 13)
- <0, 16, 8, 12, 3, 1, 4, 18> has chord (1, 4)
- <0, 16, 8, 12, 3, 1, 4, 17> has chord (1, 4)
- <0, 16, 8, 12, 1, 4, 17, 12> has chord (1, 4)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are a total of [0] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
