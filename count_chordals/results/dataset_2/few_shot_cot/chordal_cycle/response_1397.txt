Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 12>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 1, 3>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 1, 19>
- Cycle 4: <1, 12, 7, 16>
- Cycle 5: <1, 12, 10, 19>
- Cycle 6: <2, 18, 16, 7>
- Cycle 7: <2, 18, 16, 4>
- Cycle 8: <3, 1, 5, 11>
- Cycle 9: <3, 1, 12, 7>
- Cycle 10: <3, 1, 19, 10>
- Cycle 11: <4, 6, 7, 16>
- Cycle 12: <8, 9, 17, 15>
- Cycle 13: <10, 8, 17, 15>
- Cycle 14: <10, 8, 19, 1>
- Cycle 15: <10, 8, 19, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 1, 12> is chordal with a chord (1,3)
- <0, 5, 1, 3> is chordal with a chord (1,12)
- <0, 5, 1, 19> is chordal with a chord (1,12)
- <1, 12, 7, 16> is chordal with a chord (7,6)
- <1, 12, 10, 19> is chordal with a chord (12,7)
- <2, 18, 16, 7> is chordal with a chord (16,3)
- <2, 18, 16, 4> is chordal with a chord (16,7)
- <3, 1, 5, 11> is chordal with a chord (1,12)
- <3, 1, 12, 7> is chordal with a chord (1,19)
- <3, 1, 19, 10> is chordal with a chord (1,12)
- <4, 6, 7, 16> is chordal with a chord (7,12)
- <8, 9, 17, 15> is chordal with a chord (17,2)
- <10, 8, 17, 15> is chordal with a chord (17,2)
- <10, 8, 19, 1> is chordal with a chord (8,9)
- <10, 8, 19, 2> is chordal with a chord (8,9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There are a total of [1] chordless 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final count of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
