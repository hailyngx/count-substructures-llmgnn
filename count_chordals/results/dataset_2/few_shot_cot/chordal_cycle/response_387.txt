Response:
Step 1: Based on the given graph, we list the cycles of length 4.

Cycles of length 4:
1. <0, 9, 5, 1>
2. <0, 9, 5, 7>
3. <0, 9, 4, 6>
4. <0, 9, 4, 12>
5. <0, 9, 13, 2>
6. <0, 1, 5, 7>
7. <0, 1, 5, 6>
8. <0, 1, 7, 14>
9. <0, 1, 13, 9>
10. <0, 3, 1, 5>
11. <0, 3, 1, 7>
12. <0, 3, 10, 4>
13. <0, 3, 13, 9>
14. <0, 3, 13, 2>
15. <1, 5, 9, 13>
16. <1, 5, 7, 14>
17. <1, 7, 14, 10>
18. <3, 1, 5, 6>
19. <3, 1, 7, 14>
20. <3, 1, 13, 9>
21. <3, 10, 4, 6>
22. <3, 10, 7, 14>
23. <3, 13, 9, 10>
24. <4, 9, 1, 7>
25. <4, 9, 13, 2>
26. <4, 12, 2, 11>
27. <4, 12, 11, 14>
28. <5, 9, 4, 6>
29. <5, 9, 13, 2>
30. <5, 1, 7, 14>
31. <5, 7, 8, 13>
32. <5, 7, 14, 10>
33. <6, 5, 1, 7>
34. <9, 5, 7, 10>
35. <9, 13, 8, 7>
36. <12, 4, 9, 13>
37. <12, 4, 6, 5>
38. <12, 2, 13, 9>
39. <12, 14, 7, 10>
40. <13, 9, 1, 5>
41. <13, 2, 12, 4>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Out of the listed cycles above, the following cycles have exactly one chord (and are therefore chordal 4-cycles):
1. <0, 9, 5, 1> with chord (0, 5)
2. <0, 1, 5, 7> with chord (1, 7)
3. <0, 3, 10, 4> with chord (3, 10)
4. <0, 3, 13, 2> with chord (3, 13)
5. <5, 9, 4, 6> with chord (4, 9)
6. <5, 1, 7, 14> with chord (1, 7)
7. <9, 5, 7, 10> with chord (5, 7)
8. <12, 4, 9, 13> with chord (4, 9)
9. <13, 9, 1, 5> with chord (1, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
Thus, there are 9 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph. Therefore, the final count is [9].
