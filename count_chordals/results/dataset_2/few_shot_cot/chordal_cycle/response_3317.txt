Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, 4, 7, 13>.

Let's go through the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph:

**Step 1:** List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- The cycles in the graph are: <0, 4, 7, 13>, <0, 4, 8, 14>, <1, 10, 12, 5>, <2, 5, 13, 7>, <2, 8, 4, 10>, <2, 8, 14, 11>, <3, 7, 4, 8>, <4, 6, 9, 10>, <4, 6, 11, 0>, <5, 2, 13, 7>, <6, 9, 10, 12>, <7, 4, 8, 3>, <8, 2, 5, 13>, <10, 6, 9, 4>, <11, 0, 12, 1>, <12, 2, 5, 14>, <13, 2, 8, 4>, <14, 3, 7, 13>.

**Step 2:** Check each cycle for exactly one chord. 
- Only the cycle <0, 4, 7, 13> has exactly one chord which is the edge between nodes 4 and 7.

**Step 3:** Count the number of chordal cycles found.
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [1].
