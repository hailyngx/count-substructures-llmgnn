Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- <1, 9, 11, 16>
- <1, 9, 17, 12>
- <1, 15, 16, 11>
- <1, 15, 19, 18>
- <2, 13, 7, 3>

Next, let's identify the cycles with exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- <1, 9, 11, 16> with (9, 16) as the chord
- <1, 9, 17, 12> with (9, 12) as the chord
- <1, 15, 16, 11> with (15, 11) as the chord
- <1, 15, 19, 18> with (15, 18) as the chord

There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
