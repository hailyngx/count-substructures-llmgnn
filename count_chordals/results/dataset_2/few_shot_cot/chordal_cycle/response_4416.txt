Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 7) (6, 0) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 5) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (5, 4) (4, 0) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 8, 9, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 2, 3, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 1, 6, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 2, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 8, 5, 1, 6>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 9, 2, 4>
- Cycle 3: <1, 9, 8, 7, 6>
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 8, 3, 0, 6>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 3, 8, 7>
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 3, 4, 5>
- Cycle 7: <2, 9, 8, 5, 4>
- Cycle 8: <3, 0, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 9: <3, 0, 6, 8, 5>
- Cycle 10: <3, 0, 4, 5, 1>
- Cycle 11: <3, 9, 8, 7, 1>
- Cycle 12: <3, 9, 8, 6, 0>
- Cycle 13: <3, 9, 1, 5, 4>
- Cycle 14: <4, 0, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 15: <4, 0, 3, 9, 1>
- Cycle 16: <4, 2, 9, 8, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 3, 8, 5> with chord (3, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 9, 3, 8> with chord (1, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, 0, 6, 1> with chord (0, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 13 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
