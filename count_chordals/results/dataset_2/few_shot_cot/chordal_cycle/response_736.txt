Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 1) (14, 7) (14, 9) (17, 14) (17, 13) (17, 2) (17, 15) (17, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (1, 7) (3, 5) (2, 17) (2, 18) (2, 19) (2, 16) (18, 2) (18, 5) (18, 12) (7, 14) (7, 17) (7, 1) (7, 12) (12, 18) (12, 7) (12, 0) (10, 1) (10, 15) (10, 4) (15, 17) (15, 10) (15, 11) (8, 9) (8, 0) (9, 14) (9, 8) (9, 13) (13, 17) (13, 9) (0, 12) (0, 8) (0, 11) (0, 6) (11, 15) (11, 0) (11, 5) (19, 2) (5, 3) (5, 18) (5, 11) (6, 0) (6, 4) (6, 16) (16, 2) (16, 6) (16, 4) (4, 10) (4, 6) (4, 16) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 12, 8, 11, and node 6

Node 5 is connected to node 3, 18, and node 11
Node 6 is connected to node 0, 4, and node 16
Node 7 is connected to node 14, 17, 1, and node 12
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 14, 8, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 1, 15, and node 4
Node 11 is connected to node 15, 0, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 18, 7, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 17, and node 9
Node 14 is connected to node 17, 1, 7, and node 9
Node 15 is connected to node 17, 10, and node 11
Node 16 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 4
Node 17 is connected to node 14, 13, 2, 15, and node 7
Node 18 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 12
Node 19 is connected to node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
- Nodes 0, 6, 12, 8 form a cycle: <0, 12, 18, 8>
- Nodes 1, 7, 17, 14 form a cycle: <1, 14, 17, 7>
- Nodes 2, 16, 4, 10 form a cycle: <2, 10, 4, 16>
- Nodes 5, 3, 11, 15 form a cycle: <3, 5, 11, 15>
- Nodes 4, 16, 2, 18 form a cycle: <4, 18, 2, 16>
- Nodes 9, 13, 17, 14 form a cycle: <9, 14, 17, 13>

Step 2:
- Checking for chords in each of the cycles:
    - <1, 14, 17, 7> has a chord (1, 17)
    - <9, 14, 17, 13> has a chord (9, 17)

Step 3:
Since both cycles <1, 14, 17, 7> and <9, 14, 17, 13> have chords, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
