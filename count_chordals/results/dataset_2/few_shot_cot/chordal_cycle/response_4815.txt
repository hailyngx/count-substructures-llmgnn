Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 3, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 3, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (9, 3, 0, 8, 9)
- Cycle 3: (4, 5, 9, 8, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 9, 3, 7)
- Cycle 5: (2, 5, 9, 3, 2)
- Cycle 6: (6, 4, 5, 2, 6)
- Cycle 7: (8, 4, 1, 8)
- Cycle 8: (0, 9, 3, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (4, 8), 6>
- <2, (5, 9), 6>
- <3, (9, 3), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- [1]
