Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <3, 13, 0, 7> (chordless cycle)
- <5, 6, 17, 14> (chordless cycle)
- <15, 2, 9, 19> (chordless cycle)
- <10, 15, 16, 11> (chordless cycle)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <10, 15, 16, 11> has a chord <10, 16> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [3]. 

Therefore, the final answer is [3].
