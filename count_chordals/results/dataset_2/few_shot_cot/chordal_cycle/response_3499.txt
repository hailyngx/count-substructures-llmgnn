Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - <2, (0, 3), 9>: 2-0-3-9-2 (Chord: 0-3)
        - <3, (1, 6), 0>: 1-6-3-0-1 (Chord: 1-6)
        - <1, (4, 8), 5>: 1-4-8-5-1 (Chord: 4-8)
        - <1, (2, 0), 3>: 2-0-3-9-2 (Chord: 0-2)
        - <0, (5, 7), 3>: 5-7-6-3-5 (Chord: 6-7)
        - <4, (9, 3), 6>: 9-3-6-7-9 (Chord: 3-6)
        - <6, (1, 4), 9>: 1-4-9-3-1 (Chord: 1-4)
        - <8, (5, 7), 6>: 5-7-6-8-5 (Chord: 6-7)
