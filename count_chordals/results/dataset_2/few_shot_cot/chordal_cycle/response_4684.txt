Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (12, 19, 8, 13)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (4, 16, 2, 21)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (7, 16, 4, 13)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (9, 20, 27, 26)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (9, 20, 3, 14)
- Cycle with 5 nodes: (0, 24, 5, 21, 2)
- Cycle with 5 nodes: (0, 25, 1, 13, 4)
- Cycle with 6 nodes: (0, 24, 23, 8, 19, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- No chordal 4-cycles are found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
