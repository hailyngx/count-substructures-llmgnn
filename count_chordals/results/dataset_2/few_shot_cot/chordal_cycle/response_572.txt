Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 5) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 0) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 5, 0> 
- Cycle 2: <1, 6, 4, 8, 1> 
- Cycle 3: <2, 1, 5, 7, 2> 
- Cycle 4: <3, 7, 4, 8, 3> 
- Cycle 5: <5, 6, 4, 7, 5> 
- Cycle 6: <8, 6, 4, 7, 8> 
- Cycle 7: <0, 9, 6, 8, 0> 
- Cycle 8: <1, 6, 5, 7, 1> 
- Cycle 9: <2, 1, 8, 0, 2> 
- Cycle 10: <3, 7, 5, 0, 3> 

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 5, 0> has a chord: (6, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 6, 4, 8, 1> has a chord: (4, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, 1, 5, 7, 2> has a chord: (5, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, 7, 4, 8, 3> has a chord: (4, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 6, 4, 7, 5> has a chord: (4, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <8, 6, 4, 7, 8> has a chord: (4, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <0, 9, 6, 8, 0> has a chord: (6, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, 6, 5, 7, 1> has a chord: (5, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <2, 1, 8, 0, 2> has a chord: (8, 0)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <3, 7, 5, 0, 3> has a chord: (5, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
