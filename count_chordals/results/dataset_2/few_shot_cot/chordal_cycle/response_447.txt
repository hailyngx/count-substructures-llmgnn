Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (4, 7, 12, 23)
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 23, 12)
- Cycle 3: (4, 17, 10, 3)
- Cycle 4: (4, 17, 10, 1)
- Cycle 5: (4, 17, 16, 25)
- Cycle 6: (4, 5, 4, 7)
- Cycle 7: (4, 5, 4, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 5, 17, 10)
- Cycle 9: (4, 5, 17, 16)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <4, (7, 23), 12>
- <4, (17, 10), 3>
- <4, (17, 16), 25>
- <7, (4, 3), 22>
- <7, (4, 3), 13>
- <7, (12, 0), 8>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 3 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [3].
