Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 13, 10, 4>
- <0, 13, 9, 14>
- <0, 6, 11, 2>
- <1, 8, 4, 10>
- <1, 8, 5, 12>
- <1, 8, 3, 5>
- <1, 8, 3, 12>
- <1, 8, 1, 0>
- <1, 12, 7, 6>
- <1, 12, 5, 7>
- <1, 12, 3, 5>
- <1, 12, 3, 8>
- <1, 11, 7, 6>
- <1, 11, 9, 13>
- <1, 11, 9, 14>
- <1, 11, 2, 0>
- <1, 11, 2, 0>
- <1, 11, 9, 10>
- <2, 11, 7, 6>
- <3, 8, 5, 7>
- <3, 8, 5, 6>
- <3, 8, 1, 12>
- <3, 8, 1, 0>
- <3, 5, 7, 6>
- <3, 5, 12, 7>
- <3, 5, 12, 1>
- <3, 5, 6, 7>
- <3, 12, 7, 6>
- <3, 12, 1, 8>
- <3, 12, 1, 0>
- <3, 12, 5, 7>
- <4, 8, 5, 7>
- <4, 8, 5, 6>
- <4, 8, 1, 10>
- <4, 10, 0, 13>
- <5, 7, 12, 3>
- <5, 7, 12, 1>
- <5, 6, 7, 4>
- <5, 6, 11, 2>
- <5, 6, 11, 9>
- <6, 7, 4, 10>
- <6, 7, 4, 8>
- <6, 7, 5, 8>
- <6, 7, 5, 12>
- <6, 11, 7, 4>
- <6, 11, 2, 0>
- <7, 12, 1, 8>
- <7, 12, 3, 8>
- <8, 4, 10, 0>
- <9, 13, 10, 4>
- <9, 13, 0, 2>
- <9, 13, 0, 10>
- <9, 13, 0, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 8, 4, 10> has a chord (8, 10)
- <1, 8, 3, 12> has a chord (8, 12)
- <1, 11, 2, 0> has a chord (11, 0)
- <3, 8, 5, 7> has a chord (8, 5)
- <4, 8, 5, 7> has a chord (8, 5)
- <6, 7, 4, 10> has a chord (7, 10)
- <9, 13, 10, 4> has a chord (13, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 44 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
