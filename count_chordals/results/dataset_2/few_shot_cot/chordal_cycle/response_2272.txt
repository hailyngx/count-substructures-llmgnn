- <0, 10, 13, 14>
- <1, 5, 4, 0>
- <1, 5, 12, 7>
- <1, 5, 10, 4>
- <1, 5, 14, 13>

- <13, 7, 4, 10>
- <13, 7, 12, 5>
- <13, 14, 5, 0>
- <13, 14, 5, 6>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Chordless: <0, 4, 5, 1>, <1, 5, 14, 13>, <2, 3, 14, 5>, <2, 0, 10, 4>, <2, 0, 5, 4>, <3, 11, 8, 6>, <4, 0, 5, 1>, <4, 5, 13, 7>, <5, 0, 4, 7>, <6, 14, 5, 0>, <6, 14, 13, 7>, <8, 6, 5, 4>, <8, 6, 14, 5>, <10, 0, 5, 4>, <10, 1, 5, 4>, <11, 3, 14, 5>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 16 chordless cycles found.
  
Therefore, the final answer is [16].
