Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <2, 15, 27, 8>
2. <2, 4, 29, 13>
3. <4, 1, 20, 24>
4. <4, 29, 5, 0>
5. <7, 3, 22, 16>
6. <18, 19, 26, 11>
7. <18, 6, 21, 13>
8. <9, 15, 27, 8>
9. <9, 19, 26, 11>
10. <10, 7, 3, 22>
11. <10, 28, 24, 20>
12. <11, 28, 29, 5>
13. <12, 1, 4, 29>
14. <13, 29, 5, 16>
15. <16, 22, 0, 5>
16. <19, 18, 0, 22>
17. <20, 1, 4, 2>
18. <21, 6, 18, 19>
19. <23, 26, 19, 9>
20. <24, 15, 27, 8>

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. <2, 15, 27, 8> (Chord: (15, 8))
2. <2, 4, 29, 13> (Chord: (4, 13))
3. <4, 1, 20, 24> (Chord: (1, 20))
4. <4, 29, 5, 0> (Chord: (29, 5))
5. <7, 3, 22, 16> (Chord: (3, 22))
6. <18, 19, 26, 11> (Chord: (19, 26))
7. <18, 6, 21, 13> (Chord: (6, 21))
8. <9, 15, 27, 8> (Chord: (15, 27))
9. <9, 19, 26, 11> (Chord: (26, 11))
10. <10, 7, 3, 22> (Chord: (7, 22))
11. <10, 28, 24, 20> (Chord: (24, 20))
12. <11, 28, 29, 5> (Chord: (28, 5))
13. <12, 1, 4, 29> (Chord: (1, 4))
14. <13, 29, 5, 16> (Chord: (29, 16))
15. <16, 22, 0, 5> (Chord: (22, 0))
16. <19, 18, 0, 22> (Chord: (18, 0))
17. <20, 1, 4, 2> (Chord: (1, 4))
18. <21, 6, 18, 19> (Chord: (6, 18))
19. <23, 26, 19, 9> (Chord: (26, 19))
20. <24, 15, 27, 8> (Chord: (15, 8))

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [20]

Therefore, there are 20 unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
