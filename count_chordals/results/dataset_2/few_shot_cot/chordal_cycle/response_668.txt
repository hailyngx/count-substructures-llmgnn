Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, 14, (5, 8), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 103 cycles listed. The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 14, (5, 8), 6>. Therefore, the final count is [102].
