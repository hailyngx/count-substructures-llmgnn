Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 12) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 14) (9, 7) (9, 13) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 4) (10, 2) (11, 14) (11, 1) (11, 6) (4, 10) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 10) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 13) (2, 6) (0, 4) (0, 14) (0, 3) (14, 5) (14, 9) (14, 11) (14, 0) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 13) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 3) (1, 11) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 12) (6, 10) (6, 11) (6, 2) (6, 1) (6, 13) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 1) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 3) (13, 6)

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is: <0, (14, 11), 1, 12>
Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
