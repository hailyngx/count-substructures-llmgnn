Node 12 is connected to node 1, 10, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 6, 1, 12, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 3, 13, 7> (chordless cycle)
- <0, 3, 9, 6> (chordless cycle)
- <0, 3, 9, 10> (chordless cycle)
- <0, 3, 1, 12> (chordless cycle)
- <0, 8, 7, 14> (chordless cycle)
- <0, 8, 2, 14> (chordless cycle)
- <0, 8, 2, 11> (chordless cycle)
- <1, 10, 4, 11> (chordless cycle)
- <1, 10, 9, 6> (chordless cycle)
- <1, 10, 9, 3> (chordless cycle)
- <1, 10, 12, 14> (chordless cycle)
- <2, 10, 4, 11> (chordless cycle)
- <2, 10, 9, 6> (chordless cycle)
- <2, 10, 1, 12> (chordless cycle)
- <2, 14, 7, 13> (chordless cycle)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 3, 13, 7> - No chord
- <0, 3, 9, 6> - No chord
- <0, 3, 9, 10> - No chord
- <0, 3, 1, 12> - No chord
- <0, 8, 7, 14> - No chord
- <0, 8, 2, 14> - No chord
- <0, 8, 2, 11> - No chord
- <1, 10, 4, 11> - No chord
- <1, 10, 9, 6> - No chord
- <1, 10, 9, 3> - No chord
- <1, 10, 12, 14> - No chord
- <2, 10, 4, 11> - No chord
- <2, 10, 9, 6> - No chord
- <2, 10, 1, 12> - No chord
- <2, 14, 7, 13> - No chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 14 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [14].
