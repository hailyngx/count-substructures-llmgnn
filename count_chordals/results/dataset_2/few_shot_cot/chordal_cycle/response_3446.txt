Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 9) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 0, 5, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-1-3-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-5-8-7-0
- Cycle 3: 1-4-7-9-1
- Cycle 4: 2-7-4-6-2
- Cycle 5: 4-7-2-9-4
- Cycle 6: 4-9-0-8-5-4
- Cycle 7: 4-9-1-6-4
- Cycle 8: 5-4-7-9-5
- Cycle 9: 6-4-7-9-6
- Cycle 10: 7-4-6-3-1-7

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- For Cycle 1, there is exactly one chord <4, 1>.
- For Cycle 2, there is exactly one chord <4, 8>.
- For Cycle 3, there is exactly one chord <4, 9>.
- For Cycle 4, there is no chord present.
- For Cycle 5, there is no chord present.
- For Cycle 6, there is no chord present.
- For Cycle 7, there is no chord present.
- For Cycle 8, there is no chord present.
- For Cycle 9, there is exactly one chord <4, 9>.
- For Cycle 10, there is no chord present.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord.

Therefore, the final count is [3].
