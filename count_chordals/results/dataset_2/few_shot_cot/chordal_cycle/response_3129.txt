Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, 8, 10, 27> with non-adjacent chords (8, 27).

Following the steps provided:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 8, 10, 27, 25, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 13, 21, 23, 8, 2, 18, 9, 19, 29, 26, 6, 17, 13, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 8, 23, 21, 13, 4, 11, 25, 27, 5, 1, 29, 9, 18, 2)
- Cycle 4: (3, 15, 6, 17, 13, 21, 23, 14, 2, 18, 3)
- Cycle 5: (4, 13, 21, 23, 14, 15, 6, 17, 16, 27, 25, 11, 4)
- Cycle 6: (5, 1, 13, 17, 16, 27, 25, 0, 24, 20, 21, 13, 10, 27, 5)
- Cycle 7: (6, 15, 14, 23, 21, 13, 1, 5, 11, 25, 12, 0, 24, 22, 7, 26)
- Cycle 8: (7, 22, 24, 0, 8, 23, 14, 15, 3, 18, 9, 19, 29, 26, 6, 17)
- Cycle 9: (9, 18, 3, 15, 6, 17, 16, 27, 25, 11, 4, 13, 1, 29, 26, 9)
- Cycle 10: (10, 8, 23, 21, 13, 4, 11, 25, 27, 16, 17, 6, 15, 14, 2, 18)

Step 2: Identify the unique chordal 4-cycle:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle is <0, 8, 10, 27> with non-adjacent chords (8, 27).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
