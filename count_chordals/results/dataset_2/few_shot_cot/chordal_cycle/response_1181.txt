Response:
After following the steps outlined in the prompt, we can find the unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph:

1. Identify all cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: <9, 5, 8, 21, 9>
- Cycle 2: <9, 1, 23, 21, 9>
- Cycle 3: <9, 6, 7, 2, 9>
- Cycle 4: <5, 8, 21, 23, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 24, 25, 3, 5>
- Cycle 6: <6, 7, 13, 16, 6>
- Cycle 7: <6, 22, 19, 25, 6>
- Cycle 8: <7, 13, 16, 14, 7>
- Cycle 9: <7, 29, 18, 26, 7>
- Cycle 10: <8, 21, 28, 15, 8>
- Cycle 11: <12, 22, 19, 0, 12>
- Cycle 12: <12, 17, 15, 28, 12>
- Cycle 13: <13, 16, 9, 1, 13>
- Cycle 14: <13, 7, 29, 18, 13>
- Cycle 15: <14, 16, 9, 1, 14>
- Cycle 16: <15, 17, 12, 25, 15>
- Cycle 17: <16, 9, 1, 23, 16>
- Cycle 18: <17, 15, 28, 21, 17>
- Cycle 19: <18, 29, 13, 7, 18>
- Cycle 20: <19, 25, 3, 1, 19>
- Cycle 21: <21, 8, 5, 24, 21>
- Cycle 22: <22, 6, 7, 13, 22>
- Cycle 23: <23, 1, 9, 6, 23>
- Cycle 24: <24, 5, 9, 1, 24>
- Cycle 25: <25, 24, 5, 8, 25>
- Cycle 26: <27, 20, 4, 14, 27>
- Cycle 27: <28, 15, 17, 12, 28>
- Cycle 28: <29, 18, 26, 7, 29>
- Cycle 29: <29, 0, 19, 25, 29>

2. Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <9, (1, 23), 21, 9>
- <13, (7, 29), 18, 13>
- <16, (9, 1), 23, 14>
- <17, (15, 28), 21, 17>
- <25, (3, 19), 0, 29>

3. Count the number of chordless cycles:
There are 30 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count to represent the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [30].
