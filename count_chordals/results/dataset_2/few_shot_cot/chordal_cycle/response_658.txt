Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (0, 7) (0, 8) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 1 - 5 - 9 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 5 - 9 - 2 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 5 - 2 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 4: 1 - 9 - 6 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 5: 2 - 9 - 6 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 6: 2 - 9 - 1 - 7 - 2
- Cycle 7: 3 - 6 - 9 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 8: 3 - 6 - 7 - 2 - 3
- Cycle 9: 3 - 4 - 7 - 2 - 3
- Cycle 10: 3 - 4 - 1 - 7 - 3

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 2 has chord (9, 2)
- Cycle 3 has chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 4 has chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 5 has chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 6 has chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 7 has chord (6, 5)
- Cycle 8 has chord (6, 7)
- Cycle 9 has chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 10 has chord (4, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: 
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (9, 6), 5, 9, 6>
- <2, (9, 2), 9, 6, 7, 2>
- <3, (2, 7), 5, 9, 1>
- <4, (9, 6), 1, 7, 6>
- <5, (9, 6), 2, 7, 6>
- <6, (9, 1), 5, 9, 2>
- <7, (6, 5), 3, 6, 9>
- <8, (6, 7), 2, 7, 3>
- <9, (4, 7), 1, 4, 7>
- <10, (4, 7), 3, 7, 4>
