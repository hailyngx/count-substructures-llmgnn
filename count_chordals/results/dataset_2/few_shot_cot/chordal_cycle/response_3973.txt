Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle: 0-1-4-5-0
2. Cycle: 1-4-8-9-1
3. Cycle: 1-3-7-8-1
4. Cycle: 2-3-7-8-2
5. Cycle: 2-4-5-6-2

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for a chord:
1. Cycle: 0-1-4-5-0 has chord (1, 4)
2. Cycle: 1-4-8-9-1 has chord (4, 9)
3. Cycle: 1-3-7-8-1 has chord (3, 8)
4. Cycle: 2-3-7-8-2 has chord (3, 8)
5. Cycle: 2-4-5-6-2 has chord (4, 5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, we have 0 (as there are chords in all the cycles).

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
<1, (1, 4), 5)>
<2, (4, 9), 1)>
<3, (3, 8), 7)>
<4, (3, 8), 2)>
<5, (4, 5), 6)>
