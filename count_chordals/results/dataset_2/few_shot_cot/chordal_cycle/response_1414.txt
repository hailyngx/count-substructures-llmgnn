Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle: <1, 7, 3, 0, 1> (Chord: (7, 0))
- Cycle: <3, 7, 15, 19, 3> (Chord: (7, 19))
- Cycle: <3, 5, 11, 28, 3> (Chord: (5, 28))
- Cycle: <3, 5, 11, 6, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 28, 2, 17, 3>
- Cycle: <3, 28, 2, 27, 3> (Chord: (2, 27))
- Cycle: <3, 28, 2, 16, 3>
- Cycle: <7, 1, 29, 7>
- Cycle: <7, 9, 21, 27, 7>
- Cycle: <7, 9, 20, 14, 7> (Chord: (9, 14))
- Cycle: <7, 9, 15, 19, 7> (Chord: (9, 19))
- Cycle: <7, 9, 15, 3, 7>
- Cycle: <7, 24, 0, 3, 7>
- Cycle: <7, 24, 10, 11, 7>
- Cycle: <7, 24, 10, 16, 7>
- Cycle: <7, 24, 0, 19, 7>
- Cycle: <22, 8, 13, 19, 22>
- Cycle: <22, 8, 13, 23, 22>
- Cycle: <22, 8, 13, 23, 27, 22> (Chord: (13, 27))
- Cycle: <22, 8, 13, 23, 27, 2, 22> (Chord: (2, 27))
- Cycle: <22, 8, 13, 23, 27, 25, 22>
- Cycle: <22, 2, 17, 16, 22>
- Cycle: <22, 2, 17, 18, 22>
- Cycle: <22, 2, 28, 3, 22>
- Cycle: <22, 2, 28, 11, 22>
- Cycle: <22, 2, 27, 23, 22> (Chord: (2, 23))

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 7, 3, 0, 1> (Chord: (7, 0))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 7, 15, 19, 3> (Chord: (7, 19))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 28, 2, 27, 3> (Chord: (2, 27))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <7, 9, 20, 14, 7> (Chord: (9, 14))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <7, 9, 15, 19, 7> (Chord: (9, 19))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <22, 8, 13, 23, 27, 22> (Chord: (13, 27))
- Chordal 4-cycle: <22, 2, 27, 23, 22> (Chord: (2, 23))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [7]
