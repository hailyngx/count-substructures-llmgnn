Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 6, 9, 2, 4>
<0, 6, 5, 1, 8>
<0, 6, 5, 4, 8>
<0, 6, 7, 9, 2>
<0, 6, 7, 3, 2>
<1, 5, 6, 9, 2>
<1, 5, 4, 6, 8>
<1, 5, 8, 4, 6>
<2, 9, 6, 5, 1>
<2, 9, 7, 6, 5>
<2, 9, 7, 3, 4>
<2, 9, 7, 3, 6>
<3, 6, 5, 4, 8>
<3, 6, 7, 9, 2>
<3, 6, 9, 2, 4>
<3, 7, 6, 5, 1>
<3, 7, 2, 4, 8>
<3, 7, 9, 6, 5>
<4, 6, 5, 1, 8>
<4, 6, 8, 1, 5>
<4, 8, 1, 5, 6>
<4, 8, 5, 6, 9>
<5, 6, 7, 9, 2>
<5, 6, 9, 2, 4>
<5, 8, 1, 5, 6>
<5, 8, 4, 6, 7>
<6, 9, 7, 3, 2>
<6, 9, 2, 4, 8>
<7, 6, 5, 1, 8>
<7, 6, 9, 2, 4>
<7, 9, 2, 4, 8>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 6, 7, 9, 2> (Chord: (6, 9))
<0, 6, 7, 3, 2> (Chord: (6, 3))
<1, 5, 6, 9, 2> (Chord: (5, 9))
<2, 9, 7, 3, 4> (Chord: (7, 4))
<3, 6, 9, 2, 4> (Chord: (6, 9))

Step 3:
Total number of chordal 4-cycles = [5]
