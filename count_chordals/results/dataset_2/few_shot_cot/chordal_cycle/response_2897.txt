Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 1, 10, 14, 7>
- <0, 1, 6, 2, 5>
- <0, 1, 10, 8, 5>
- <0, 1, 7, 5, 8>
- <0, 3, 12, 2, 5>
- <0, 4, 12, 2, 5>
- <0, 4, 9, 7, 5>
- <0, 4, 9, 11, 5>
- <0, 12, 2, 5, 8>
- <1, 6, 2, 5, 8>
- <1, 7, 5, 8, 10>
- <1, 10, 14, 7, 9>
- <2, 5, 7, 9, 13>
- <2, 5, 8, 10, 14>
- <2, 12, 11, 9, 3>
- <2, 12, 11, 9, 13>
- <2, 14, 10, 1, 7>
- <2, 14, 10, 13, 7>
- <3, 0, 1, 7, 5>
- <3, 4, 9, 11, 5>
- <3, 8, 5, 7, 1>
- <3, 8, 10, 14, 7>
- <4, 9, 7, 5, 8>
- <7, 1, 10, 14, 2>
- <7, 5, 8, 10, 1>
- <7, 5, 8, 10, 13>
- <7, 9, 13, 10, 14>
- <9, 4, 12, 0, 3>
- <9, 4, 12, 3, 8>
- <9, 11, 5, 8, 10>
- <9, 13, 7, 1, 10>
- <12, 3, 8, 5, 7>
- <12, 4, 0, 1, 7>
- <12, 4, 9, 7, 1>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
  - <0, (12, 4), 9, 7> - (1, 4) is the chord
  - <0, (12, 2), 5, 8> - (2, 12) is the chord
  - <4, (12, 0), 1, 7> - (0, 12) is the chord
  - <0, (1, 10), 14, 7> - (1, 10) is the chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 30 chordless cycles.

Final count of chordal 4-cycles: [4]
