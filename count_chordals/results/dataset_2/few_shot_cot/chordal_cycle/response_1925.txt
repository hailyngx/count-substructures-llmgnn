Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
1. <0, 4, 15, 16, 0>
2. <0, 4, 15, 6, 9, 7, 14, 1, 19, 12, 16, 0>
3. <0, 4, 15, 6, 9, 14, 1, 19, 12, 16, 0>
4. <0, 4, 10, 8, 3, 11, 19, 1, 14, 7, 9, 6, 15, 16, 12, 17, 2, 17, 8, 10, 0>
5. <0, 5, 19, 11, 3, 8, 10, 4, 15, 6, 9, 14, 1, 12, 16, 17, 2, 17, 16, 15, 4, 0>
6. <1, 14, 9, 7, 8, 3, 11, 19, 5, 0, 4, 10, 8>
7. <2, 17, 12, 16, 0, 4, 10, 8, 3, 11, 19, 1, 14, 7, 9, 6, 15, 16>
8. <2, 17, 12, 13, 12, 16, 15, 6, 9, 7, 14, 1, 19, 11, 3, 8, 10, 0, 5, 19>

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, (4, 10), 8>
2. <0, (4, 15), 6>
3. <0, (4, 15), 16>
4. <0, (10, 4), 8>
5. <0, (10, 8), 3>
6. <0, (16, 15), 6>
7. <0, (16, 15), 4>
8. <2, (17, 12), 16>
9. <2, (17, 12), 13>
10. <6, (15, 4), 0>
11. <6, (15, 16), 0>

Step 3:
There are a total of 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is: [11].
