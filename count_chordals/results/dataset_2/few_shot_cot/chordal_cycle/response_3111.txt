Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 1, 2>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 8, 4>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 8, 2>
- Cycle 5: <0, 8, 4, 9>
- Cycle 6: <0, 8, 4, 2>
- Cycle 7: <0, 8, 2, 4>
- Cycle 8: <0, 8, 2, 1>
- Cycle 9: <0, 8, 1, 5>
- Cycle 10: <1, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle 11: <1, 5, 7, 3>
- Cycle 12: <1, 5, 7, 6>
- Cycle 13: <1, 5, 3, 7>
- Cycle 14: <1, 9, 8, 6>
- Cycle 15: <1, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 16: <1, 9, 4, 2>
- Cycle 17: <1, 6, 7, 0>
- Cycle 18: <1, 6, 7, 3>
- Cycle 19: <1, 6, 7, 5>
- Cycle 20: <1, 6, 8, 0>
- Cycle 21: <1, 6, 8, 2>
- Cycle 22: <1, 6, 8, 4>
- Cycle 23: <1, 6, 8, 9>
- Cycle 24: <1, 6, 0, 7>
- Cycle 25: <1, 6, 0, 8>
- Cycle 26: <1, 6, 0, 7>
- Cycle 27: <2, 4, 9, 8>
- Cycle 28: <2, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle 29: <2, 4, 9, 8>
- Cycle 30: <2, 4, 8, 9>
- Cycle 31: <2, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 32: <2, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle 33: <2, 8, 9, 4>
- Cycle 34: <2, 8, 9, 1>
- Cycle 35: <2, 8, 9, 4>
- Cycle 36: <2, 8, 1, 5>
- Cycle 37: <2, 8, 1, 6>
- Cycle 38: <3, 7, 5, 1>
- Cycle 39: <3, 7, 5, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <0, 6, 1, 5> has a chord: (1, 6)
- <0, 6, 8, 4> has a chord: (4, 8)
- <0, 6, 8, 2> has a chord: (2, 8)
- <0, 8, 2, 4> has a chord: (2, 4)
- <1, 5, 7, 0> has a chord: (0, 7)
- <1, 5, 3, 7> has a chord: (3, 5)
- <1, 9, 8, 6> has a chord: (6, 8)
- <2, 4, 9, 8> has a chord: (9, 4)
- <3, 7, 5, 1> has a chord: (1, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 31 chordless 4-cycles in the graph, so the final answer is [31].
