Response:
In this graph, the chordal 4-cycle found is: <7, (10, 18), 14)>.

Following the step-by-step process mentioned earlier:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle {7, 10, 18, 14}
- Cycle {7, 10, 14, 6}
- Cycle {7, 18, 15, 0}
- and more...

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle {7, 10, 18, 14} has exactly one chord (10, 18).
- Cycle {7, 10, 14, 6} has more than one chord and thus is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle {7, 18, 15, 0} has more than one chord and thus is not a chordal 4-cycle.
- and more...

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
From the above analysis, we can see that there is only one chordal 4-cycle, which is <7, (10, 18), 14)>.
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
