Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <6, 5, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 2: <6, 1, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 3: <6, 1, 5, 4, 6>
- Cycle 4: <6, 1, 8, 4, 6>
- Cycle 5: <6, 8, 4, 5, 6>
- Cycle 6: <6, 8, 2, 4, 6>
- Cycle 7: <6, 0, 5, 4, 6>
- Cycle 8: <6, 0, 3, 7, 6>
- Cycle 9: <5, 4, 8, 2, 5>
- Cycle 10: <5, 4, 1, 6, 5>
- Cycle 11: <5, 4, 2, 8, 5>
- Cycle 12: <5, 4, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 13: <5, 2, 8, 4, 5>
- Cycle 14: <5, 2, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 15: <5, 0, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 16: <5, 0, 3, 7, 5>
- Cycle 17: <4, 8, 2, 5, 4>
- Cycle 18: <4, 8, 1, 6, 4>
- Cycle 19: <4, 8, 2, 5, 4>
- Cycle 20: <4, 8, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 21: <4, 2, 8, 5, 4>
- Cycle 22: <4, 2, 7, 5, 4>
- Cycle 23: <4, 1, 6, 5, 4>
- Cycle 24: <4, 1, 7, 5, 4>
- Cycle 25: <8, 4, 2, 5, 8>
- Cycle 26: <8, 4, 1, 6, 8>
- Cycle 27: <8, 4, 2, 5, 8>
- Cycle 28: <8, 4, 6, 1, 8>
- Cycle 29: <8, 2, 4, 5, 8>
- Cycle 30: <8, 2, 7, 5, 8>
- Cycle 31: <8, 1, 6, 4, 8>
- Cycle 32: <8, 1, 7, 4, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has a chord: Chord (6, 4)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: Chord (1, 8)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: Chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: Chord (1, 4)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: Chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: Chord (8, 2)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: Chord (0, 5)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: Chord (0, 3)
- Cycle 13 has a chord: Chord (5, 4)
- Cycle 14 has a chord: Chord (5, 2)
- Cycle 18 has a chord: Chord (4, 1)
- Cycle 19 has a chord: Chord (4, 2)
- Cycle 23 has a chord: Chord (4, 6)
- Cycle 24 has a chord: Chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 29 has a chord: Chord (8, 5)
- Cycle 30 has a chord: Chord (8, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 28 chordal 4-cycles in this graph, so the final number is [28].
