Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 7, 3, 5>
2. <0, 7, 13, 9>
3. <0, 14, 9, 13>
4. <0, 14, 11, 9>
5. <1, 5, 8, 13>
6. <1, 5, 3, 7>
7. <1, 5, 3, 10>
8. <1, 8, 13, 9>
9. <1, 8, 13, 4>
10. <1, 8, 12, 7>
11. <1, 10, 0, 14>
12. <1, 10, 14, 9>
13. <1, 12, 7, 3>
14. <2, 9, 13, 7>
15. <2, 9, 13, 4>
16. <4, 13, 9, 14>
17. <4, 13, 7, 3>
18. <4, 14, 9, 13>
19. <6, 13, 9, 11>
20. <7, 3, 5, 1>
21. <7, 3, 10, 0>
22. <7, 12, 1, 5>
23. <7, 12, 1, 8>
24. <8, 5, 1, 10>
25. <8, 5, 3, 7>
26. <9, 2, 12, 1>
27. <9, 2, 13, 4>
28. <9, 11, 14, 0>
29. <9, 13, 4, 14>
30. <10, 1, 5, 3>
31. <10, 1, 12, 7>
32. <10, 4, 13, 9>
33. <10, 4, 14, 0>
34. <11, 9, 13, 7>
35. <13, 9, 11, 14>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, 7, 13, 9> with chord (9, 13) 
2. <0, 14, 11, 9> with chord (9, 11)
3. <1, 8, 13, 9> with chord (8, 9)
4. <1, 10, 0, 14> with chord (0, 14)
5. <2, 9, 13, 4> with chord (9, 13)
6. <4, 14, 9, 13> with chord (9, 13)
7. <7, 3, 5, 1> with chord (3, 5)
8. <7, 3, 10, 0> with chord (3, 10)
9. <8, 5, 1, 10> with chord (1, 10)
10. <9, 2, 12, 1> with chord (2, 12)
11. <10, 4, 13, 9> with chord (4, 13)

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [24].
