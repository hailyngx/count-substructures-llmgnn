Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 4) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (0, 7) (0, 5) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
Here are the cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. (1, 9, 8, 4, 7, 3, 1)
2. (1, 9, 6, 5, 1)
3. (2, 9, 8, 4, 7, 2)
4. (3, 1, 9, 6, 3)
5. (3, 1, 5, 6, 3)
6. (3, 1, 9, 8, 3)
7. (3, 4, 7, 6, 3)
8. (4, 7, 6, 9, 4)
9. (4, 8, 9, 6, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <1, (3, 7), 5>
2. <1, (5, 6), 9>
3. <2, (4, 7), 9>
4. <3, (1, 9), 6>
5. <3, (1, 5), 9>
6. <3, (1, 8), 9>
7. <3, (6, 7), 1>
8. <4, (6, 9), 7>
9. <4, (6, 8), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
