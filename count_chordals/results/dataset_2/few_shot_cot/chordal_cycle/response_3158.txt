Node 19 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 17

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (3, 1, 19, 5, 7, 3)
- Cycle 2: (3, 1, 18, 10, 14, 7, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 1, 18, 10, 14, 15, 4, 11, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 7, 14, 15, 4, 11, 8, 12, 0, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
The only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 3: <3, (1, 19), 5, 7, 3)> with the chord (1, 19).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1]. The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <3, (1, 19), 5, 7, 3)>.
