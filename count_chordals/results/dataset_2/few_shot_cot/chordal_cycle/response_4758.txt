Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle 2: <1, 9, 4, 7, 1>
- Cycle 3: <2, 9, 4, 3, 2>
- Cycle 4: <4, 9, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 5: <4, 9, 6, 3, 4>
- Cycle 6: <4, 7, 5, 8, 4>
- Cycle 7: <5, 8, 6, 0, 5>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Checking Cycle 1: <0, 5, 7, 4, 8> has a chord (4, 8)
- Checking Cycle 2: <1, 9, 4, 7, 1> has a chord (4, 7)
- Checking Cycle 3: <2, 9, 4, 3, 2> has a chord (4, 3)
- Checking Cycle 4: <4, 9, 6, 1, 4> has a chord (6, 1)
- Checking Cycle 5: <4, 9, 6, 3, 4> has a chord (6, 3)
- Checking Cycle 6: <4, 7, 5, 8, 4> has a chord (8, 5)
- Checking Cycle 7: <5, 8, 6, 0, 5> has a chord (6, 0)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, (4, 8), 5>
<1, (4, 7), 9>
<2, (4, 3), 9>
<4, (6, 1), 9>
<4, (6, 3), 9>
<4, (8, 5), 7>
<5, (6, 0), 8>
