Response:
Let's first list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <5, 9, 13, 8, 5>
2. <5, 9, 13, 25, 10, 6, 28, 29, 4, 27, 1, 24, 11, 8, 13, 9>
3. <9, 13, 8, 3, 8, 13, 25, 23, 19, 5, 9>
4. <18, 26, 21, 0, 12, 22, 15, 9, 13, 8, 11, 17, 23, 19, 21>
5. <18, 26, 0, 12, 2, 27, 20, 27, 4, 29, 28, 6, 10, 25, 23, 17, 26, 18>
6. <26, 18, 23, 19, 5, 9, 15, 22, 12, 0, 21, 19>
7. <26, 18, 24, 1, 27, 20, 27, 4, 29, 28, 6, 7, 11, 8, 13, 25, 23, 17, 26>
8. <0, 12, 18, 23, 19, 21>
9. <1, 24, 18, 23, 19, 21, 0, 12>
10. <6, 10, 25, 23, 19, 21, 0, 12, 2, 27, 20>
11. <4, 29, 28, 6, 7, 16, 10, 25, 13, 9, 15, 22, 12, 0, 21, 19, 5>
12. <27, 20, 21, 19, 5, 9, 15, 22, 12, 0>
13. <16, 10, 6, 7, 11, 8, 13, 25, 23, 17, 26, 21, 19, 5, 9, 15>

Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. <5, 9, 13, 8, 5> - 1 chord (9, 8)
2. <5, 9, 13, 25, 10, 6, 28, 29, 4, 27, 1, 24, 11, 8, 13, 9> - 1 chord (9, 25)
3. <9, 13, 8, 3, 8, 13, 25, 23, 19, 5, 9> - 1 chord (9, 25)
4. <18, 26, 21, 0, 12, 22, 15, 9, 13, 8, 11, 17, 23, 19, 21> - 1 chord (26, 12)
5. <18, 26, 0, 12, 2, 27, 20, 27, 4, 29, 28, 6, 10, 25, 23, 17, 26, 18> - 1 chord (18, 23)
6. <26, 18, 23, 19, 5, 9, 15, 22, 12, 0, 21, 19> - 1 chord (26, 19)
7. <26, 18, 24, 1, 27, 20, 27, 4, 29, 28, 6, 7, 11, 8, 13, 25, 23, 17, 26> - 1 chord (26, 11)
8. <0, 12, 18, 23, 19, 21> - 1 chord (0, 19)
9. <1, 24, 18, 23, 19, 21, 0, 12> - 1 chord (1, 18)
10. <6, 10, 25, 23, 19, 21, 0, 12, 2, 27, 20> - 1 chord (6, 27)
11. <4, 29, 28, 6, 7, 16, 10, 25, 13, 9, 15, 22, 12, 0, 21, 19, 5> - 1 chord (4, 16)
12. <27, 20, 21, 19, 5, 9, 15, 22, 12, 0> - 1 chord (27, 12)
13. <16, 10, 6, 7, 11, 8, 13, 25, 23, 17, 26, 21, 19, 5, 9, 15> - 1 chord (16, 23)

Therefore, there are [13] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
