The edges are as follows: (6, 7) (6, 10) (6, 3) (6, 12) (9, 8) (9, 10) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 13) (4, 5) (4, 11) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 1) (12, 6) (12, 14) (12, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 13) (2, 10) (0, 12) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 11) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 11) (5, 14) (13, 9) (13, 2) (13, 11) (11, 4) (11, 0) (11, 5) (11, 13) (14, 12) (14, 5) (14, 3) (14, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 14) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 14) (1, 10) (10, 6) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 2) (10, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 12, 2, 3, and node 11
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 7, 14, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 0, 13, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 0, and node 14
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 11, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, 11, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 10, 3, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 10, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 5, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 10, 3, 7, and node 13
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 2, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 0, 5, and node 13
Node 12 is connected to node 6, 14, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 12, 5, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 12, 14, 5, 4, 11, 0> (7-cycle)
- <1, 8, 9, 10, 1> (4-cycle)
- <2, 4, 11, 13, 2> (4-cycle)
- <3, 6, 10, 9, 8, 5, 14, 3> (8-cycle)
- <7, 6, 3, 0, 2, 13, 11, 5, 14, 1, 7> (11-cycle)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 8, 9, 10, 1> has exactly one chord: (8, 2)
- <2, 4, 11, 13, 2> has exactly one chord: (4, 13)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are <1, (8, 2), 9, 10, 1> and <2, (4, 13), 11, 13, 2>, and the final count is [2].
