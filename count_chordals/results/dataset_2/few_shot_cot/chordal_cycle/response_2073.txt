Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <5, 6, 1, 2>
2. <5, 6, 7, 13>
3. <5, 6, 0, 8>
4. <5, 4, 9, 14>
5. <5, 4, 13, 10>
6. <5, 14, 12, 2>
7. <5, 14, 3, 0>
8. <6, 1, 2, 0>
9. <6, 1, 2, 12>
10. <6, 7, 3, 0>
11. <6, 7, 3, 14>
12. <6, 0, 8, 13>
13. <6, 0, 8, 4>
14. <6, 7, 13, 10>
15. <4, 9, 14, 12>
16. <4, 8, 13, 10>
17. <9, 14, 12, 2>
18. <9, 13, 10, 14>
19. <8, 11, 12, 2>
20. <8, 11, 12, 14>
21. <8, 0, 3, 14>
22. <8, 0, 3, 7>
23. <13, 10, 14, 12>
24. <13, 7, 3, 0>
25. <14, 3, 7, 13>

Step 2:
Checking for one chord in each cycle:
- <5, 6, 1, 2> has chord (6, 1)
- <5, 6, 7, 13> has chord (13, 7)
- <5, 6, 0, 8> has chord (8, 0)
- <5, 4, 9, 14> has chord (4, 9)
- <5, 14, 12, 2> has chord (12, 14)
- <6, 1, 2, 0> has chord (1, 2)
- <6, 7, 3, 0> has chord (7, 3)
- <6, 0, 8, 13> has chord (8, 13)
- <4, 9, 14, 12> has chord (9, 14)
- <8, 11, 12, 2> has chord (11, 12)
- <13, 7, 3, 0> has chord (7, 3)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which have exactly one chord: [10]
