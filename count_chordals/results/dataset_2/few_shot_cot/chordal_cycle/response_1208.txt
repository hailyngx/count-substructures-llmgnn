Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
<0, 10, 2, 8>, <1, 3, 5, 7>, <1, 3, 8, 5>, <1, 4, 9, 13>, <1, 7, 0, 5>, <1, 10, 2, 12>, <1, 13, 9, 6>, <2, 12, 6, 9>, <3, 5, 7, 1>, <3, 8, 12, 6>, <4, 9, 6, 12>, <5, 7, 0, 10>, <5, 8, 12, 11>, <6, 9, 4, 1>, <7, 1, 3, 5>, <7, 5, 0, 10>, <9, 4, 1, 13>, <10, 0, 2, 8>, <11, 5, 3, 1>, <12, 6, 7, 9>, <13, 9, 7, 1>, <13, 1, 4, 9>, <14, 12, 6, 9>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are: 
<1, 3, 5, 7>, <1, 4, 9, 13>, <5, 7, 0, 10>, <7, 1, 3, 5>, <13, 9, 7, 1>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [19].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, 3, 8, 5>
