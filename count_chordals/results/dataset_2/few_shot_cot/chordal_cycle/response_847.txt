Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 5, 7, 6> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 11, 7, 6> 
- Cycle 3: <0, 8, 6, 7, 5> 
- Cycle 4: <0, 8, 10, 7, 6> 
- Cycle 5: <0, 12, 6, 7, 3> 
- Cycle 6: <1, 8, 6, 7, 5> 
- Cycle 7: <1, 8, 10, 7, 6> 
- Cycle 8: <1, 12, 6, 7, 3> 
- Cycle 9: <2, 9, 11, 7, 6> 
- Cycle 10: <2, 9, 11, 3, 12>
- Cycle 11: <2, 9, 10, 7, 6>
- Cycle 12: <2, 0, 4, 11, 7>
- Cycle 13: <2, 0, 8, 6, 7>
- Cycle 14: <2, 13, 1, 8, 6>
- Cycle 15: <3, 7, 6, 8, 10>
- Cycle 16: <3, 7, 11, 9, 10>
- Cycle 17: <3, 12, 6, 8, 10>
- Cycle 18: <4, 0, 12, 6, 7>
- Cycle 19: <4, 11, 7, 6, 8>
- Cycle 20: <4, 11, 9, 10, 7>
- Cycle 21: <5, 4, 0, 12, 6>
- Cycle 22: <5, 7, 6, 8, 10>
- Cycle 23: <6, 8, 0, 4, 11>
- Cycle 24: <6, 7, 5, 2, 9>
- Cycle 25: <7, 6, 12, 0, 4>
- Cycle 26: <7, 11, 9, 2, 5>
- Cycle 27: <9, 6, 12, 0, 4>
- Cycle 28: <9, 11, 7, 5, 2>
- Cycle 29: <10, 9, 2, 5, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <0, 4, 5, 7, 6>: Chord (4, 7)
- <0, 4, 11, 7, 6>: Chord (4, 7)
- <0, 8, 6, 7, 5>: Chord (8, 7)
- <0, 8, 10, 7, 6>: Chord (8, 7)
- <2, 9, 11, 3, 12>: Chord (2, 3)
- <2, 0, 4, 11, 7>: Chord (0, 11)
- <2, 0, 8, 6, 7>: Chord (0, 7)
- <3, 7, 11, 9, 10>: Chord (7, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordless cycles: [25]
