Response:
Following the steps mentioned earlier:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 6, 12>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 13, 3>
- Cycle 3: <0, 11, 14, 5>
- Cycle 4: <0, 12, 6, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 12, 0>
- Cycle 6: <3, 9, 14, 11>
- Cycle 7: <3, 10, 5, 2>
- Cycle 8: <3, 10, 11, 8>
- Cycle 9: <4, 0, 12, 6>
- Cycle 10: <4, 0, 11, 14>
- Cycle 11: <5, 2, 6, 12>
- Cycle 12: <5, 10, 3, 14>
- Cycle 13: <6, 1, 8, 11>
- Cycle 14: <6, 1, 12, 0>
- Cycle 15: <6, 3, 9, 14>
- Cycle 16: <6, 3, 10, 1>
- Cycle 17: <6, 7, 9, 14>
- Cycle 18: <6, 8, 11, 2>
- Cycle 19: <7, 6, 12, 1>
- Cycle 20: <8, 1, 12, 0>
- Cycle 21: <8, 10, 3, 9>
- Cycle 22: <8, 10, 5, 2>
- Cycle 23: <9, 3, 10, 1>
- Cycle 24: <9, 14, 11, 0>
- Cycle 25: <10, 3, 13, 4>
- Cycle 26: <10, 5, 14, 9>
- Cycle 27: <10, 11, 8, 6>
- Cycle 28: <11, 0, 14, 5>
- Cycle 29: <11, 2, 6, 12>
- Cycle 30: <11, 8, 1, 6>
- Cycle 31: <13, 3, 14, 9>
- Cycle 32: <14, 0, 11, 2>
- Cycle 33: <14, 3, 10, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 1, 6, 12> has a chord: (1, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 11, 14, 5> has a chord: (11, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 10, 11, 8> has a chord: (10, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 2, 6, 12> has a chord: (2, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, 1, 8, 11> has a chord: (1, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 32 cycles in total, and 5 of them are chordal. Hence, the number of chordless cycles is 32 - 5 = 27.

Therefore, the final count is [27].
