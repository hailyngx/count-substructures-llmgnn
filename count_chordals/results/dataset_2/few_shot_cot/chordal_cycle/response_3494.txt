Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 9, 5, 4>
- <0, 9, 7, 11>
- <0, 10, 15, 18>
- <0, 12, 6, 3>
- <1, 13, 8, 2>
- <3, 6, 12, 9>
- <4, 5, 9, 7>
- <8, 13, 1, 4>
- <14, 17, 16, 8>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is:
- <0, 9, 5, 4, (10, 15)>

Step 3:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final answer is [1].
