Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 6) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:

There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-6-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-9-6-3-0
- Cycle 3: 0-9-6-2-0
- Cycle 4: 0-4-5-1-0
- Cycle 5: 0-4-8-7-0
- Cycle 6: 0-4-2-3-0
- Cycle 7: 5-1-6-9-5
- Cycle 8: 5-4-7-8-5
- Cycle 9: 3-6-2-9-3

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:

- <0, (9, 6), 1, 0> has a chord (9, 6)
- <0, (9, 6), 3, 0> has a chord (9, 6)
- <0, (9, 6), 2, 0> has a chord (9, 6)
- <0, (4, 5), 1, 0> has a chord (4, 5)
- <0, (4, 8), 7, 0> has a chord (4, 8)
- <0, (4, 2), 3, 0> has a chord (4, 2)
- <5, (1, 6), 9, 5> has a chord (1, 6)
- <5, (4, 7), 8, 5> has a chord (4, 7)
- <3, (6, 2), 9, 3> has a chord (6, 2)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:

There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
