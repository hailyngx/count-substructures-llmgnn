3. Cycle <0, 6, 7, 9>
4. Cycle <0, 6, 8, 2, 9>
5. Cycle <0, 9, 4, 7>
6. Cycle <0, 9, 4, 1>
7. Cycle <0, 9, 2, 8>
8. Cycle <1, 9, 4, 7>
9. Cycle <1, 9, 4, 2>
10. Cycle <1, 9, 7, 3>
11. Cycle <1, 9, 7, 5>
12. Cycle <1, 4, 7, 5>

21. Cycle <2, 9, 4, 1>
22. Cycle <2, 9, 1, 8>
23. Cycle <2, 8, 5, 7>
24. Cycle <2, 8, 5, 6>
25. Cycle <3, 7, 4, 9>
26. Cycle <3, 7, 4, 1>
27. Cycle <3, 7, 5, 6>
28. Cycle <3, 0, 6, 5>
29. Cycle <3, 0, 6, 8>
30. Cycle <3, 0, 8, 2>
31. Cycle <4, 9, 7, 6>
32. Cycle <4, 9, 2, 8>
33. Cycle <5, 6, 8, 2>
34. Cycle <5, 6, 7, 9>
35. Cycle <5, 7, 4, 9>
36. Cycle <5, 7, 4, 1>
37. Cycle <6, 5, 7, 9>
38. Cycle <6, 7, 9, 4>
39. Cycle <6, 7, 4, 1>
40. Cycle <7, 6, 5, 8>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
1. <0, 6, 8, 5>, chord: (6, 5)
2. <0, 6, 7, 9>, chord: (6, 9)
3. <0, 9, 4, 1>, chord: (9, 1)
4. <1, 4, 7, 5>, chord: (4, 5)
5. <1, 4, 2, 8>, chord: (4, 8)
6. <2, 9, 1, 8>, chord: (9, 8)
7. <3, 0, 6, 5>, chord: (0, 5)
8. <4, 9, 2, 8>, chord: (9, 8)
9. <5, 6, 7, 9>, chord: (6, 9)
10. <6, 7, 9, 4>, chord: (7, 4)

Step 3:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
