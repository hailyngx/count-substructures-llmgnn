Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. <0, 8, 6, 2, 1>
2. <0, 8, 6, 9, 3>
3. <0, 8, 4, 7, 5>
4. <1, 5, 7, 6, 9>
5. <2, 6, 9, 3, 0>
6. <2, 6, 7, 5, 1>
7. <3, 5, 7, 4, 8>
8. <3, 9, 6, 7, 5>
9. <4, 7, 5, 1, 6>
10. <4, 8, 2, 6, 7>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <0, 8, 6, 2, 1> - Chord: (6, 1)
2. <0, 8, 6, 9, 3> - Chord: (6, 9)
3. <0, 8, 4, 7, 5> - Chord: (4, 5)
4. <1, 5, 7, 6, 9> - Chord: (5, 9)
5. <2, 6, 9, 3, 0> - Chord: (9, 0)
6. <2, 6, 7, 5, 1> - Chord: (6, 5)
7. <3, 5, 7, 4, 8> - Chord: (5, 4)
8. <3, 9, 6, 7, 5> - Chord: (6, 7)
9. <4, 7, 5, 1, 6> - Chord: (7, 1)
10. <4, 8, 2, 6, 7> - Chord: (2, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.
