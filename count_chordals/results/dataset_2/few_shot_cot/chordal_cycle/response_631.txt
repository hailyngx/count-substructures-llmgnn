Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <0, 16, 19, 7, 17, 1, 5, 13, 4, 8> (length 9)
        - Cycle 2: <2, 11, 16, 19, 7, 17, 0, 10> (length 8)
        - Cycle 3: <3, 5, 13, 1, 17, 0, 10> (length 7)
        - Cycle 4: <4, 15, 3, 5, 13, 1, 12, 6> (length 8)
        - Cycle 5: <6, 8, 4, 15, 3, 5, 1, 12> (length 8)
        - Cycle 6: <7, 17, 0, 10, 2, 11, 16, 19> (length 8)
        - Cycle 7: <8, 4, 15, 3, 5, 13, 1, 12> (length 8)
        - Cycle 8: <9, 8, 4, 15, 3, 5, 13, 1> (length 8)
        - Cycle 9: <12, 8, 4, 15, 3, 5, 13, 1> (length 8)
        - Cycle 10: <13, 5, 1, 12, 14, 18, 7, 17> (length 8)
        - Cycle 11: <14, 18, 7, 17, 0, 16, 11, 2> (length 8)
        - Cycle 12: <16, 11, 2, 10, 0, 17, 7, 19> (length 8)
        - Cycle 13: <17, 1, 12, 14, 18, 9, 8, 6> (length 8)
        - Cycle 14: <18, 9, 8, 4, 13, 5, 3, 15> (length 8)
        - Cycle 15: <19, 16, 11, 2, 10, 0, 17, 7> (length 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - <0, (16, 19), 7, 17, 1, 5, 13, 4, 8> has one chord (16, 19)
        - <2, 11, (16, 19), 7, 17, 0, 10> has one chord (16, 19)
        - <3, 5, 13, 1, 17, (0, 10)> has one chord (0, 10)
        - <4, 15, 3, 5, 13, 1, 12, 6> has one chord (3, 12)
        - <6, 8, 4, 15, 3, 5, 1, 12> has one chord (4, 15)
        - <7, 17, 0, 10, 2, 11, 16, 19> has one chord (11, 2)
        - <8, 4, 15, 3, 5, 13, 1, 12> has one chord (4, 15)
        - <9, 8, 4, 15, 3, 5, 13, 1> has one chord (4, 15)
        - <12, 8, 4, 15, 3, 5, 13, 1> has one chord (4, 15)
        - <13, 5, 1, 12, 14, 18, 7, 17> has one chord (1, 12)
        - <14, 18, 7, 17, 0, 16, 11, 2> has one chord (14, 18)
        - <16, 11, 2, 10, 0, 17, 7, 19> has one chord (11, 2)
        - <17, 1, 12, 14, 18, 9, 8, 6> has one chord (12, 14)
        - <18, 9, 8, 4, 13, 5, 3, 15> has one chord (4, 13)
        - <19, 16, 11, 2, 10, 0, 17, 7> has one chord (16, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are 15 cycles with exactly one chord, so the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [15].
