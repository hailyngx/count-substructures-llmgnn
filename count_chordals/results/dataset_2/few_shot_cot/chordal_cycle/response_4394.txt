Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge):
- The cycle <0, 7, 12, 15> has a chord: (7, 12)
- The cycle <0, 14, 11, 18> has a chord: (11, 14)
- The cycle <1, 10, 8, 6> has a chord: (8, 10)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have a total of [47]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 7, 12, 15>
- <0, 14, 11, 18>
- <1, 10, 8, 6>
