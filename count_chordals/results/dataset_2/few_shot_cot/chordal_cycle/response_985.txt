Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
- <6, 9, 4, 1> with chord (9, 1)
- <6, 9, 4, 10> with chord (9, 10)
- <6, 9, 2, 14> with chord (9, 14)
- <6, 9, 2, 7> with chord (9, 7)
- <6, 9, 10, 8> with chord (9, 8)
- <6, 9, 10, 11> with chord (9, 11)
- <6, 3, 7, 11> with chord (3, 11)
- <6, 3, 7, 0> with chord (3, 0)
- <6, 3, 4, 9> with chord (3, 4)
- <6, 3, 4, 1> with chord (3, 1)
- <1, 4, 10, 8> with chord (4, 10)
- <1, 4, 10, 11> with chord (4, 11)
- <4, 9, 10, 8> with chord (10, 8)
- <4, 9, 10, 11> with chord (10, 11)

Step 3: 
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [14].
