Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 in the graph:

- <0, 9, 4, 8>
- <0, 9, 11, 10>
- <0, 9, 11, 13>
- <0, 14, 3, 11>
- <0, 14, 7, 6>
- <1, 10, 11, 6>
- <1, 10, 7, 2>
- <2, 8, 4, 5>
- <2, 8, 0, 14>
- <2, 12, 6, 7>
- <2, 12, 1, 10>
- <3, 11, 6, 7>
- <3, 11, 13, 5>
- <4, 9, 10, 1>
- <4, 9, 11, 6>
- <5, 11, 6, 7>
- <5, 11, 13, 0>
- <6, 7, 2, 12>
- <6, 7, 10, 1>
- <7, 10, 1, 12>
- <8, 4, 5, 13>
- <8, 4, 9, 0>
- <11, 6, 7, 14>
- <11, 13, 0, 9>
- <12, 6, 7, 14>
- <12, 6, 11, 3>
- <13, 6, 7, 14>
- <13, 6, 11, 3>
- <14, 0, 9, 4>
- <14, 0, 13, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <2, 8, (4, 5), 13>
- <2, 12, (1, 10), 6>
- <3, 11, (6, 7), 13>
- <4, 9, (10, 1), 8>
- <6, 7, (2, 12), 1>
- <8, 4, (9, 0), 5>
- <11, 6, (7, 14), 3>
- <11, 13, (0, 9), 5>
- <12, 6, (7, 14), 11>
- <13, 6, (7, 14), 11>
- <14, 0, (9, 4), 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [11].
