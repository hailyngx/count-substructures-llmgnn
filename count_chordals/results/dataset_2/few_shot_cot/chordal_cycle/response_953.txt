- <4, 15, 23, 20> has a chord: (15, 20)
- <7, 13, 1, 8> has a chord: (8, 1)
- <0, 16, 7, 13> has a chord: (0, 7)
- <0, 10, 25, 8> has a chord: (10, 25)
- <20, 3, 11, 5> has a chord: (3, 5)
- <14, 24, 19, 5> has a chord: (24, 19)
- <14, 27, 12, 26> has a chord: (14, 27)

- <12, 3, 28, 6> has a chord: (3, 28)
- <29, 26, 12, 21> has a chord: (26, 21)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in this graph.
Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles is [0].
