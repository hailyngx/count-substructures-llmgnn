Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 9, 6, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 4, 7, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 2, 8, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 4, 7, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 8, 7, 0)
- Cycle 6: (1, 4, 7, 8, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 5, 9, 3, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 5, 4, 7, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 3, 6, 9, 2)
- Cycle 10: (2, 3, 8, 7, 2)
- Cycle 11: (3, 9, 6, 7, 3)
- Cycle 12: (3, 9, 5, 2, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <0, (4, 7), 5>
- <0, (8, 7), 4>
- <0, (5, 2), 8>
- <1, (4, 7), 8>
- <2, (5, 9), 3>
- <2, (5, 4), 7>
- <2, (3, 6), 9>
- <2, (3, 8), 7>
- <3, (9, 6), 7>
- <3, (5, 9), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 3 chordless cycles found, so the final answer is [3].
