Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- There are no cycles to check for chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Since there are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph, there are no chordal 4-cycles.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
