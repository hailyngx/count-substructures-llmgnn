Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 15, 3, 1, 18, 10, 28, 29, 14, 6, 26, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 26, 14, 29, 2, 19, 23, 4, 11, 24, 20, 27, 8, 15>
- Cycle 3: <1, 18, 25, 22, 9, 10, 28, 21, 17, 13, 16, 23, 19, 2>
- Cycle 4: <3, 15, 8, 12, 1, 25, 11, 4, 23, 19, 29, 14, 13, 28>
- Cycle 5: <4, 11, 25, 17, 13, 28, 10, 16, 23, 26, 0, 15, 8, 27>
- Cycle 6: <5, 4, 23, 16, 10, 18, 25, 22, 3, 15, 0, 26, 14, 29>
- Cycle 7: <6, 14, 29, 2, 19, 23, 16, 10, 18, 1, 3, 22, 9, 22>
- Cycle 8: <7, 27, 8, 15, 0, 26, 14, 29, 20, 24, 11, 25, 17, 21>
- Cycle 9: <27, 8, 15, 0, 28, 29, 14, 26, 23, 19, 2, 29, 20, 27>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (1, 18)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (0, 26)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (1, 18)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (1, 25)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (4, 11)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (4, 23)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (0, 28)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (8, 15)
- Cycle 9 has a chord: (0, 28)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 1 chordless cycle found, therefore, the final number is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 26, 14, 29, 2, 19, 23, 4>
