Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (0, 6, 5, 1, 14, 2, 16, 15, 19, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 6, 5, 11, 8, 12, 18, 3, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 11, 8, 12, 18, 16, 2, 14, 1)
- Cycle 4: (4, 9, 15, 16, 18, 12, 8, 11, 7, 4)
- Cycle 5: (4, 9, 15, 19, 0, 3, 18, 16, 15, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 9, 13, 17, 1, 5, 6, 0, 3, 4)
- Cycle 7: (6, 0, 3, 4, 13, 17, 1, 14, 2, 6)
- Cycle 8: (9, 4, 3, 0, 19, 15, 13, 4)
- Cycle 9: (11, 5, 1, 17, 13, 9, 4, 18, 16, 11)
- Cycle 10: (11, 5, 6, 14, 2, 16, 18, 12, 8, 11)
- Cycle 11: (12, 8, 11, 7, 11, 5, 6, 0, 3, 12)
- Cycle 12: (13, 9, 15, 19, 0, 6, 5, 11, 7, 13)
- Cycle 13: (13, 9, 4, 18, 16, 15, 19, 5, 1, 13)
- Cycle 14: (13, 9, 4, 17, 1, 14, 6, 5, 19, 13)
- Cycle 15: (15, 9, 13, 17, 1, 14, 2, 16, 18, 15)
- Cycle 16: (18, 4, 9, 13, 15, 19, 5, 11, 8, 18)
- Cycle 17: (18, 4, 13, 9, 15, 16, 2, 14, 6, 18)
- Cycle 18: (19, 5, 6, 0, 3, 4, 9, 13, 17, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Cycle 3 has a chord (2, 16). <3, (2, 16)>
- Cycle 6 has a chord (17, 1). <6, (17, 1)>
- Cycle 9 has a chord (13, 9). <9, (13, 9)>
- Cycle 17 has a chord (15, 16). <17, (15, 16)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 14 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [14].
