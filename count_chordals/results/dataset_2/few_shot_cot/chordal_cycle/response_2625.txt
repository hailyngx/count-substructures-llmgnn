Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 9, 2>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 3, 5>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 8, 5>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 8, 6>
- Cycle 6: <2, 5, 8, 1>
- Cycle 7: <3, 5, 8, 7>
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 2, 9>
- Cycle 9: <4, 5, 8, 6>
- Cycle 10: <6, 9, 7, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <0, 6, 9, 2> has one chord: (6, 9)
- <0, 6, 1, 5> has one chord: (6, 5)
- <0, 7, 3, 5> has one chord: (7, 5)
- <0, 7, 8, 5> has one chord: (7, 8)
- <1, 5, 8, 6> has one chord: (1, 8)
- <2, 5, 8, 1> has one chord: (2, 8)
- <3, 5, 8, 7> has one chord: (3, 8)
- <3, 5, 2, 9> has one chord: (5, 9)
- <4, 5, 8, 6> has one chord: (5, 8)
- <6, 9, 7, 3> has one chord: (9, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are no chordless cycles found, so the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
