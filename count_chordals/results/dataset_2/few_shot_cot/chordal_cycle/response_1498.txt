Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 5) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 9, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 3, 1, 7, 4> (chord: (1, 7))
<0, 3, 1, 8, 5> (chord: (3, 5))
<0, 3, 1, 9, 4> (chord: (1, 9))
<0, 3, 1, 8, 4> (chord: (1, 8))
<0, 5, 1, 7, 4> (chord: (1, 7))
<0, 5, 1, 8, 4> (chord: (1, 8))
<2, 4, 7, 1, 3> (chord: (1, 3))
<2, 4, 7, 8, 5> (chord: (5, 8))
<6, 2, 4, 7, 1> (chord: (1, 7))
<6, 2, 3, 1, 8> (chord: (3, 8))
<6, 0, 3, 1, 7> (chord: (1, 7))
<6, 0, 3, 8, 5> (chord: (3, 5))
<6, 0, 5, 1, 7> (chord: (5, 7))
<6, 0, 5, 8, 4> (chord: (5, 8))

Step 2:
Counts of chordal 4-cycles: [7]

Step 3:
Chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 3, 1, 7, 4>
<0, 3, 14, 8, 5>
<0, 3, 1, 94>
<0, 3, 1, 8, 4>
<0, 5, 1, 7, 4>
<0, 5, 1, 8, 4>
<2, 4, 7, 1, 3>
