Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 3, 1> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 3, 2> 
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 7, 3> 
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 4, 1> 
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 4, 2> 
- Cycle 6: <0, 9, 4, 6> 
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 9, 0> 
- Cycle 8: <1, 4, 6, 0> 
- Cycle 9: <1, 4, 6, 7> 
- Cycle 10: <1, 3, 5, 7> 
- Cycle 11: <1, 3, 7, 2> 
- Cycle 12: <2, 4, 9, 0> 
- Cycle 13: <2, 4, 6, 0> 
- Cycle 14: <2, 4, 1, 3> 
- Cycle 15: <2, 7, 5, 0> 
- Cycle 16: <2, 7, 6, 0> 
- Cycle 17: <3, 5, 0, 9> 
- Cycle 18: <3, 5, 7, 6> 
- Cycle 19: <3, 7, 5, 0> 
- Cycle 20: <4, 9, 0, 5>
- Cycle 21: <4, 9, 0, 6>
- Cycle 22: <4, 1, 3, 5>
- Cycle 23: <4, 6, 0, 5>
- Cycle 24: <5, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 25: <5, 7, 6, 4>
- Cycle 26: <6, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 27: <6, 7, 5, 3>
- Cycle 28: <6, 0, 5, 7>
- Cycle 29: <7, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle 30: <7, 3, 5, 0>
- Cycle 31: <8, 6, 4, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 is a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, (1, 3), 1> 
- Cycle 2 is a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, (2, 3), 2> 
- Cycle 3 is a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 5, (3, 7), 3> 
- Cycle 4 is a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, (1, 4), 1> 
- Cycle 5 is a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, (2, 4), 2> 
- Cycle 6 is a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, (4, 6), 6> 
- Cycle 29 is a chordal 4-cycle: <7, 3, (1, 4), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 27 chordless cycles.

The final result is [27].
