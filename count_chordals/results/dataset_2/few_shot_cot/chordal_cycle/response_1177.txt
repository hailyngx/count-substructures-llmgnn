Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 13, 1, 2, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 9, 13, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 14, 10, 12, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 11, 0, 1, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 8, 3, 5, 2, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 8, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 7, 14, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 8, 13, 2, and node 10

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 8, 10, 3>
- <0, 4, 11, 9, 7>
- <0, 5, 3, 10, 8>
- <1, 7, 13, 14, 8>
- <1, 7, 9, 11, 4>
- <1, 6, 13, 7, 0>
- <1, 6, 12, 8, 4>
- <2, 6, 13, 7, 1>
- <2, 6, 12, 9, 7>
- <2, 6, 12, 8, 4>
- <2, 10, 8, 12, 6>
- <2, 10, 14, 13, 7>
- <3, 10, 8, 12, 6>
- <5, 0, 4, 11, 9>
- <5, 3, 8, 12, 6>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 4, 11, 9>
- <1, 7, 13, 14>
- <2, 6, 12, 8>
- <2, 6, 12, 9>
- <2, 10, 8, 12>
- <3, 10, 8, 12>
- <5, 0, 4, 11>

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [8].
