Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (2, 6, 15, 19, 12, 2)
- Cycle 2: (4, 5, 16, 15, 6, 2, 12, 4)
- Cycle 3: (8, 1, 11, 15, 6, 19, 17, 8)
- Cycle 4: (8, 1, 11, 2, 12, 17, 19, 15, 16, 5, 4, 10, 8)

Step 2: Identify the cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (15, 12)
- Cycle 2 has one chord (15, 6)
- Cycle 3 has one chord (15, 17)
- Cycle 4 has one chord (1, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <2, 6, 15, 19> with chord (15, 12)
- <4, 5, 16, 15> with chord (15, 6)
- <8, 1, 11, 15> with chord (15, 17)
- <1, 11, 2, 12> with chord (1, 11)
