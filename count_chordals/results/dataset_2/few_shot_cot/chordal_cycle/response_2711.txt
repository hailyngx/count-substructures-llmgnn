Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 5) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 5
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <0, 7, 1, 4, 6>
        - <0, 7, 1, 9, 6>
        - <1, 9, 6, 4, 5>
        - <1, 9, 6, 2, 3>
        - <1, 9, 4, 5, 3>
        - <3, 1, 7, 5, 4>
        - <3, 1, 9, 6, 2>
        - <3, 1, 9, 4, 5>
        - <4, 6, 9, 1, 3>
        - <4, 6, 2, 3, 5>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
        - <0, 7, 1, 4, 6> has 1 chord: (1, 4)
        - <0, 7, 1, 9, 6> has 1 chord: (1, 9)
        - <1, 9, 6, 4, 5> has 1 chord: (6, 5)
        - <1, 9, 6, 2, 3> has 1 chord: (6, 2)
        - <1, 9, 4, 5, 3> has 1 chord: (4, 3)
        - <3, 1, 7, 5, 4> has 1 chord: (5, 7)
        - <3, 1, 9, 6, 2> has 1 chord: (9, 6)
        - <3, 1, 9, 4, 5> has 1 chord: (9, 4)
        - <4, 6, 9, 1, 3> has 1 chord: (9, 3)
        - <4, 6, 2, 3, 5> has 1 chord: (2, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
        There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
