Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 8, 4, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 6, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 1, 2, 6, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 3, 0, 1, 5>
- Cycle 5: <9, 8, 0, 1, 9>
- Cycle 6: <9, 3, 0, 1, 9>
- Cycle 7: <4, 7, 6, 5, 4>
- Cycle 8: <4, 0, 1, 5, 4>
- Cycle 9: <7, 6, 2, 1, 7>
- Cycle 10: <8, 4, 7, 6, 8>
- Cycle 11: <8, 3, 0, 4, 8>
- Cycle 12: <6, 2, 1, 5, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <5, 9, 8, 4, 5> has one chord: (9, 4). <5, (9, 4), 8, 5>
- <5, 6, 7, 4, 5> has one chord: (6, 7). <5, 6, (6, 7), 4, 5>
- <5, 1, 2, 6, 5> has one chord: (1, 6). <5, 1, (1, 6), 2, 5>
- <5, 3, 0, 1, 5> has one chord: (3, 1). <5, 3, 0, (3, 1), 5>
- <9, 8, 0, 1, 9>, <9, (8, 0), 1, 9>
- <9, 3, 0, 1, 9>, <9, 3, 0, (3, 0), 9>
- <4, 7, 6, 5, 4>, <4, (7, 6), 5, 4>
- <4, 0, 1, 5, 4>, <4, 0, (0, 1), 5, 4>
- <7, 6, 2, 1, 7>, <7, (6, 2), 1, 7>
- <8, 4, 7, 6, 8>, <8, 4, (4, 7), 6, 8>
- <8, 3, 0, 4, 8>, <8, 3, 0, (3, 0), 4, 8>
- <6, 2, 1, 5, 6>, <6, 2, (2, 1), 5, 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [6].
