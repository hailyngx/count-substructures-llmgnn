Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 17, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 17, 13, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 2, 17, 13, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 3, 16, 8, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 3, 4, 5, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 14, 6, 10, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 14, 13, 17, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 0, 7, 17, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 6, 14, 1, 2>
- Cycle 10: <2, 6, 10, 15, 2>
- Cycle 11: <3, 16, 8, 13, 3>
- Cycle 12: <4, 3, 16, 8, 4>
- Cycle 13: <4, 5, 12, 19, 4>
- Cycle 14: <5, 8, 13, 17, 5>
- Cycle 15: <6, 10, 15, 14, 6>
- Cycle 16: <6, 14, 13, 8, 6>
- Cycle 17: <7, 0, 2, 17, 7>
- Cycle 18: <8, 5, 12, 19, 8>
- Cycle 19: <10, 6, 14, 1, 10>
- Cycle 20: <10, 19, 12, 5, 10>
- Cycle 21: <13, 8, 19, 12, 13>
- Cycle 22: <14, 6, 10, 2, 14>
- Cycle 23: <14, 15, 18, 19, 14>

- Cycle 25: <16, 3, 4, 5, 16>
- Cycle 26: <17, 11, 16, 3, 17>
- Cycle 27: <17, 2, 6, 14, 17>
- Cycle 28: <18, 15, 10, 19, 18>
- Cycle 29: <19, 8, 16, 11, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

 Among the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 7, 17, 2, 0> - Chord: (7, 17)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 3, 4, 5, 1> - Chord: (3, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, 6, 10, 15, 2> - Chord: (6, 15)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 3, 16, 8, 4> - Chord: (3, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
