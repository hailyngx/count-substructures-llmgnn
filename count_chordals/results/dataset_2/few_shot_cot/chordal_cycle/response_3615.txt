Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 12, 7, 1>
- <0, 12, 7, 6>
- <0, 12, 9, 1>
- <0, 14, 8, 2>
- <0, 14, 6, 7>
- <1, 3, 9, 8>
- <1, 5, 13, 2>
- <1, 5, 6, 7>
- <2, 3, 9, 8>
- <2, 13, 5, 6>
- <4, 3, 9, 1>
- <4, 3, 9, 8>
- <4, 3, 1, 5>
- <4, 6, 14, 0>
- <4, 10, 7, 1>
- <5, 13, 2, 3>
- <5, 13, 1, 9>
- <6, 14, 8, 2>
- <6, 5, 1, 3>
- <7, 1, 13, 5>
- <7, 12, 0, 14>
- <7, 12, 9, 1>
- <10, 7, 1, 5>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (4-cycle) are:
- <4, 3, 9, 1> with chord (3, 9)
- <4, 3, 1, 5> with chord (3, 1)
- <4, 10, 7, 1> with chord (10, 7)

Step 3:
There are 3 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
