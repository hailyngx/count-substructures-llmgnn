Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the provided graph is <7, (4, 23), 8, 14>.

To count the number of chordless cycles in the graph, we follow the steps outlined in the beginning:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
   - Cycle 1: 7-23-4-1-7
   - Cycle 2: 7-23-8-3-13-11-7
   - Cycle 3: 7-23-8-19-15-5-26-2-7
   - Cycle 4: 7-23-8-19-15-1-24-25-7
   - Cycle 5: 7-23-8-19-15-25-24-28-7
   - Cycle 6: 7-24-28-18-27-21-22-23-7
   - Cycle 7: 7-24-28-18-27-21-0-20-7
   - Cycle 8: 7-24-28-18-27-20-0-29-7
   - Cycle 9: 7-24-28-18-16-5-26-2-7
   - Cycle 10: 7-24-28-18-16-10-29-4-7
   - Cycle 11: 7-9-1-4-23-7
   - Cycle 12: 7-9-14-22-21-27-20-0-7
   - Cycle 13: 7-9-14-22-23-8-4-1-7

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
   Among the listed cycles, only Cycle 11: 7-9-1-4-23-7 has exactly one chord (edge 1-23).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
   There are 12 chordless cycles listed after checking for exactly one chord in each cycle.

Therefore, the final count of chordless cycles in the graph is [12].
