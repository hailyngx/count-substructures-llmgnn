Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 4, 9>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 7, 3>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 9, 8>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 7, 1>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 3, 9>
- Cycle 6: <0, 6, 4, 9, 8>
- Cycle 7: <0, 6, 7, 9, 8>
- Cycle 8: <0, 5, 2, 8>
- Cycle 9: <0, 5, 1, 7>
- Cycle 10: <0, 5, 2, 1>
- Cycle 11: <0, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 12: <0, 5, 1, 7, 3>
- Cycle 13: <0, 5, 2, 8, 9>
- Cycle 14: <0, 5, 1, 2, 8>
- Cycle 15: <1, 7, 3, 9>
- Cycle 16: <1, 7, 6, 4>
- Cycle 17: <1, 7, 9, 8>
- Cycle 18: <1, 2, 8, 9>
- Cycle 19: <1, 2, 5, 8>
- Cycle 20: <1, 2, 0, 6>
- Cycle 21: <1, 2, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 22: <1, 2, 0, 6, 4>
- Cycle 23: <2, 8, 9, 4>
- Cycle 24: <2, 8, 5, 1>
- Cycle 25: <2, 8, 0, 6>
- Cycle 26: <2, 5, 1, 7>
- Cycle 27: <2, 5, 0, 6>
- Cycle 28: <2, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 29: <3, 7, 6, 4>
- Cycle 30: <3, 7, 9, 8>
- Cycle 31: <4, 9, 8, 2>
- Cycle 32: <4, 9, 3, 7>
- Cycle 33: <5, 2, 8, 9>
- Cycle 34: <5, 2, 1, 7>
- Cycle 35: <6, 7, 1, 5>
- Cycle 36: <6, 7, 3, 0>
- Cycle 37: <6, 7, 1, 5, 2>
- Cycle 38: <7, 1, 5, 2>
- Cycle 39: <7, 1, 2, 8>
- Cycle 40: <7, 1, 5, 2, 8>
- Cycle 41: <8, 9, 4, 6>
- Cycle 42: <8, 9, 3, 7>
- Cycle 43: <9, 4, 6, 0>
- Cycle 44: <9, 4, 6, 7>
- Cycle 45: <9, 7, 1, 5>
- Cycle 46: <9, 7, 3, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- <0, 6, 4, 9> has chord (6, 9)
- <0, 6, 7, 3> has chord (6, 3)
- <0, 6, 9, 8> has chord (6, 8)
- <0, 5, 2, 8> has chord (5, 8)
- <1, 7, 3, 9> has chord (7, 9)
- <1, 7, 6, 4> has chord (1, 4)
- <1, 2, 8, 9> has chord (2, 9)
- <2, 8, 9, 4> has chord (8, 4)
- <3, 7, 6, 4> has chord (7, 4)
- <4, 9, 8, 2> has chord (9, 2)
- <5, 2, 8, 9> has chord (2, 9)
- <6, 7, 3, 0> has chord (7, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 35 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [35].
