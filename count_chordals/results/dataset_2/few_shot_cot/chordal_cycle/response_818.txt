Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: (5, 3, 9, 4, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (6, 10, 11, 16, 2, 14, 6)
- Cycle 3: (14, 0, 1, 18, 11, 16, 2, 14)
- Cycle 4: (14, 0, 18, 11, 17, 2, 14)
- Cycle 5: (14, 2, 17, 11, 18, 6, 14)
- Cycle 6: (14, 2, 16, 11, 10, 6, 14)

Step 2: Identifying cycles with only one chord:
- <1, (2, 17), 11, 16>
- <2, 11, 17, (14, 0)>
- <2, 14, 6, 10>
- <11, 17, 2, (16, 14)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
Since there are 4 cycles identified with only one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
