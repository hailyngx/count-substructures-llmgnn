Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
1. (9, 26, 13, 0, 17, 6, 28, 21, 9)
2. (9, 26, 11, 20, 13, 0, 17, 6, 28, 21, 9)
3. (9, 26, 11, 14, 24, 8, 19, 2, 10, 28, 21, 9)
4. (9, 21, 28, 6, 17, 0, 13, 26, 11, 20, 24, 14, 22, 15, 9)
5. (9, 21, 28, 6, 17, 0, 3, 0, 13, 26, 11, 20, 24, 14, 22, 15, 9)
6. (9, 21, 28, 6, 17, 0, 13, 26, 11, 14, 24, 20, 13, 16, 1, 29, 19, 12, 27, 7, 9)
7. (9, 21, 28, 5, 23, 14, 24, 20, 11, 26, 13, 0, 17, 6, 18, 16, 1, 29, 19, 8, 10, 2)
8. (9, 21, 28, 5, 23, 14, 24, 20, 13, 0, 17, 6, 18, 16, 4, 10, 8, 19, 12, 27, 7)

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is: 
<9, (21, 28), 6, 17, 0>

Step 3:
There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
