Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 10, 11, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 12, 5, 4>
- Cycle 3: <2, 7, 11, 10>
- Cycle 4: <2, 7, 8, 14>
- Cycle 5: <2, 13, 8, 1>
- Cycle 6: <3, 4, 5, 12>
- Cycle 7: <3, 10, 0, 9>
- Cycle 8: <4, 5, 6, 2>
- Cycle 9: <4, 9, 7, 11>
- Cycle 10: <5, 6, 10, 3>
- Cycle 11: <8, 14, 5, 4>
- Cycle 12: <8, 13, 1, 9>
- Cycle 13: <11, 7, 2, 13>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycles with exactly one chord are:
  - <0, 12, 5, 4> with chord (4, 5)
  - <2, 7, 11, 10> with chord (7, 10)
  - <2, 13, 8, 1> with chord (8, 13)
  - <4, 9, 7, 11> with chord (7, 9)
  - <8, 13, 1, 9> with chord (1, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 8 chordless cycles found.

Thus, the final count is [8].
