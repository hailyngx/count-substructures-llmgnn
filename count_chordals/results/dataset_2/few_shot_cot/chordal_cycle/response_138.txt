Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- <1, 11, 7, 3, 1>
- <3, 7, 11, 19, 8, 3>
- <3, 7, 13, 18, 12, 3>
- <4, 9, 17, 1, 12, 4>
- <6, 1, 17, 5, 3, 6>
- <8, 14, 4, 9, 7, 8>
- <8, 14, 4, 9, 17, 1, 12, 8>
- <10, 12, 18, 13, 15, 0, 3, 8, 19, 10>
- <10, 12, 18, 13, 15, 0, 3, 7, 11, 10>
- <10, 12, 1, 17, 5, 3, 0, 15, 6, 10>
- <11, 7, 13, 18, 12, 10, 11>
- <14, 4, 9, 17, 5, 3, 0, 15, 13, 14>
- <16, 19, 11, 7, 3, 5, 17, 9, 16>
- <18, 12, 1, 17, 9, 4, 14, 8, 6, 18>
- <19, 11, 7, 13, 18, 12, 1, 6, 15, 19>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord) are:
- <8, 14, 4, (9), 17, 1, 12, 8>
- <3, 7, (11), 19, 8, 3>
- <4, 9, (17), 1, 12, 4>
- <10, 12, (18), 13, 15, 0, 3, 8, 19, 10>
- <19, 11, 7, (13), 18, 12, 1, 6, 15, 19>

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].
