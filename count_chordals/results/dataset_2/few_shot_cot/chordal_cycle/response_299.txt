Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Checking cycle 1: <0, 1, 10, 15, 4> => Chord: (1, 15)
- Checking cycle 2: <1, 11, 14, 5, 19> => Chord: (11, 5)
- Checking cycle 3: <2, 18, 3, 14, 5> => Chord: (18, 14)
- Checking cycle 4: <3, 18, 12, 11, 15> => Chord: (18, 11)
- Checking cycle 5: <4, 15, 11, 1, 0> => Chord: (15, 1)
- Checking cycle 6: <5, 16, 17, 19, 4> => Chord: (16, 19)
- Checking cycle 7: <6, 7, 15, 11, 14> => Chord: (7, 15)
- Checking cycle 8: <7, 15, 10, 1, 0> => Chord: (15, 1)
- Checking cycle 9: <8, 14, 5, 19, 2> => Chord: (14, 19)
- Checking cycle 10: <9, 18, 12, 11, 14> => Chord: (18, 11)
- Checking cycle 11: <10, 15, 4, 19, 17> => Chord: (15, 19)
- Checking cycle 12: <11, 14, 5, 19, 17> => Chord: (14, 19)
- Checking cycle 13: <12, 18, 2, 19, 17> => Chord: (18, 19)
- Checking cycle 14: <13, 2, 19, 17, 12> => Chord: (2, 17)
- Checking cycle 15: <14, 8, 7, 6, 2> => Chord: (8, 6)
- Checking cycle 16: <15, 4, 19, 17, 12> => Chord: (4, 17)
- Checking cycle 17: <16, 5, 19, 17, 12> => Chord: (5, 17)
- Checking cycle 18: <17, 12, 18, 9, 2> => Chord: (12, 18)
- Checking cycle 19: <18, 2, 19, 17, 12> => Chord: (2, 19)
- Checking cycle 20: <19, 17, 12, 18, 3> => Chord: (17, 12)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [0] chordless cycles found in the graph.
