Response:
Step 1: 
The possible cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-10-3-1
- Cycle 2: 1-10-3-4-1
- Cycle 3: 1-6-4-14-1
- Cycle 4: 1-11-2-13-1
- Cycle 5: 2-8-9-6-2
- Cycle 6: 2-11-1-6-2
- Cycle 7: 3-4-13-2-3
- Cycle 8: 3-7-12-14-3
- Cycle 9: 4-6-9-8-4
- Cycle 10: 4-13-2-11-4
- Cycle 11: 4-14-7-12-4
- Cycle 12: 7-3-13-14-7
- Cycle 13: 8-5-10-9-8
- Cycle 14: 12-9-6-1-12
- Cycle 15: 12-14-7-3-12

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (6, 4), 14, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, (13, 2), 11, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <12, (14, 7), 3, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <9, (6, 8), 5, 10>

Step 3:
There are 4 chordless cycles found. Therefore, the final answer is [4].
