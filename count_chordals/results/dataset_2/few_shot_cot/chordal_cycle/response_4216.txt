Response:
Step 1: 
Some cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 0-10-18-2-0
- Cycle 1-7-9-4-15-19-9-7-1
- Cycle 2-13-3-15-4-9-7-1-12-16-17-14-5-13-2
- Cycle 3-15-19-9-4-15
- Cycle 4-15-3-13-5-14-17-16-12-1-16-17-8-14-5-13
- Cycle 5-14-17-16-12-3-15-19-9-7-1-12
- Cycle 6-18-10-0-6-2-13-5-14-8-17-16-1-12-3
- Cycle 7-9-19-15-3-13-5
- Cycle 8-14-17-12-16-1-7-9-4
- Cycle 9-19-15-3-13-14-8-17-12-16-1

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, (10, 18), 2, 0>
- <1, (7, 9), 4, 1>
- <2, (13, 5), 14, 2>
- <5, (13, 14), 17, 5>
- <6, (18, 13), 3, 6>
- <7, (9, 19), 15, 7>
- <8, (14, 17), 16, 8>
- <9, (19, 15), 3, 9>

Step 3:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, as shown above. 
Therefore, the final count is [8].
