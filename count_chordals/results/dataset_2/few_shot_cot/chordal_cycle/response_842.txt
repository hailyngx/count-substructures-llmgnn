Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 1, 2, 0> with edges (0, 14), (14, 2), (2, 1), (1, 0)
- Cycle <2, 4, 8, 3, 2> with edges (2, 4), (4, 8), (8, 3), (3, 2)
- Cycle <5, 6, 11, 8, 5> with edges (5, 6), (6, 11), (11, 8), (8, 5)
- Cycle <7, 9, 13, 7> with edges (7, 9), (9, 13), (13, 7), (7, 7)
- Cycle <10, 11, 13, 10> with edges (10, 11), (11, 13), (13, 10), (10, 10)
- Cycle <12, 3, 14, 6, 12> with edges (12, 3), (3, 14), (14, 6), (6, 12)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 1, 2, 0> has no chord.
- Cycle <2, 4, 8, 3, 2> has no chord.
- Cycle <5, 6, 11, 8, 5> has no chord.
- Cycle <7, 9, 13, 7> has no chord.
- Cycle <10, 11, 13, 10> has no chord.
- Cycle <12, 3, 14, 6, 12> has chord <3, 6>.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
