Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 4, 8) with edges (1, 3), (3, 4), and (4, 8)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 8, 7) with edges (1, 6), (6, 8), and (8, 7)
- Cycle 3: (1, 8, 4, 5) with edges (1, 8), (8, 4), and (4, 5)
- Cycle 4: (2, 7, 8, 4) with edges (2, 7), (7, 8), and (8, 4)
- Cycle 5: (2, 7, 6, 1) with edges (2, 7), (7, 6), and (6, 1)
- Cycle 6: (4, 5, 2, 8) with edges (4, 5), (5, 2), and (2, 8)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 2, 5) with edges (4, 8), (8, 2), and (2, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 2, 8, 4) with edges (5, 2), (2, 8), and (8, 4)
- Cycle 9: (6, 7, 8, 1) with edges (6, 7), (7, 8), and (8, 1)
- Cycle 10: (6, 8, 1, 3) with edges (6, 8), (8, 1), and (1, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 4, 8) is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (3, 8)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 8, 7) is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 3: (1, 8, 4, 5) is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 4: (2, 7, 8, 4) is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (7, 4)
- Cycle 5: (2, 7, 6, 1) is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (7, 6)
- Cycle 6: (4, 5, 2, 8) is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 2, 5) is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (8, 2)
- Cycle 8: (5, 2, 8, 4) is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (2, 8)
- Cycle 9: (6, 7, 8, 1) is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 10: (6, 8, 1, 3) is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (8, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph. Therefore, the answer is [10].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles:
<1, 3, 4, 8>
<1, 6, 8, 7>
<1, 8, 4, 5>
<2, 7, 8, 4>
<2, 7, 6, 1>
<4, 5, 2, 8>
<4, 8, 2, 5>
<5, 2, 8, 4>
<6, 7, 8, 1>
<6, 8, 1, 3>
