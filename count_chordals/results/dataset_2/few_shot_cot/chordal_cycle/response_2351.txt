Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4:
- (0, 10, 5, 9, 0)
- (0, 11, 5, 9, 0)
- (0, 3, 11, 5, 0)
- (0, 8, 6, 3, 0)
- (0, 1, 11, 5, 0)
- (1, 11, 5, 9, 1)
- (1, 2, 10, 5, 1)
- (2, 10, 5, 9, 2)
- (3, 11, 5, 9, 3)
- (3, 6, 8, 0, 3)
- (3, 4, 14, 13, 3)
- (4, 14, 13, 12, 4)
- (4, 3, 11, 6, 4)
- (5, 9, 12, 13, 5)
- (5, 13, 14, 7, 5)
- (5, 7, 10, 2, 5)
- (6, 8, 12, 13, 6)
- (6, 11, 5, 13, 6)
- (6, 4, 3, 11, 6)
- (7, 14, 13, 12, 7)
- (7, 10, 5, 13, 7)
- (7, 9, 12, 13, 7)
- (8, 6, 4, 14, 8)
- (8, 6, 11, 5, 8)
- (9, 5, 13, 14, 9)
- (9, 7, 14, 13, 9)
- (10, 5, 13, 14, 10)
- (10, 7, 14, 13, 10)
- (11, 5, 13, 14, 11)
- (12, 13, 14, 7, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, (1, 11), 5, 9>
- <0, (10, 2), 5, 9>
- <3, (4, 14), 13, 12>
- <5, (7, 14), 13, 9>
- <6, (8, 12), 13, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found: [5]
