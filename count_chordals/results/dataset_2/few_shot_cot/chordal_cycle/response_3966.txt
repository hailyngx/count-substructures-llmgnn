Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 6) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 9) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 1) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 9) (9, 0) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 2, 7, 1, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 0, 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 5, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 6
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 0, 2, 7, 1, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 7, 9, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 2, 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 2, 9, 7, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 9, 3, 4, 0>
- Cycle 8: <0, 9, 1, 8, 0>
- Cycle 9: <1, 8, 4, 5, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 8, 4, 3, 1>
- Cycle 11: <1, 7, 0, 9, 1>
- Cycle 12: <1, 7, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle 13: <2, 4, 8, 5, 2>
- Cycle 14: <2, 4, 3, 6, 2>
- Cycle 15: <2, 0, 8, 5, 2>
- Cycle 16: <2, 0, 7, 9, 2>
- Cycle 17: <2, 9, 3, 6, 2>
- Cycle 18: <3, 4, 5, 6, 3>
- Cycle 19: <4, 8, 5, 6, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 8, 5, 4, 0>, chord (8, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 1, 7, 9, 0>, chord (1, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 8, 4, 5, 1>, chord (8, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, 4, 8, 5, 2>, chord (4, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 4, 3, 6, 2>, chord (4, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:

There are 5 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [5].
