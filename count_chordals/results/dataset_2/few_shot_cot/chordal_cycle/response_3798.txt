Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 17, 14, 25, 0>
- <0, 17, 9, 22, 0>
- <0, 21, 3, 7, 11, 2, 13, 26, 18, 22, 0>
- <0, 21, 12, 29, 18, 22, 0>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 17, (9, 14), 25, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 17, (9, 22), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 21, (3, 13), 26, 18, 22, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 21, 12, 29, 18, 22, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 21, (29, 18), 22, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 28, (25, 14), 17, 9, 3, 7, 11, 2, 13, 26, 18, 22, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 28, 25, (5, 14), 17, 9, 3, 21, 29, 12, 21, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 29, 12, 28, (25, 14), 17, 9, 22, 18, 26, 13, 2, 11, 7, 3, 21, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 11, 7, 3, 21, 0, 17, 9, 22, 18, 26, 13, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 21, 0, 17, 9, 22, 18, 26, 13, 2, 11, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <10, 5, 25, (14, 17), 9, 22, 18, 26, 13, 2, 11, 15, 22, 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <10, (27, 8), 14, 17, 9, 22, 18, 26, 13, 2, 11, 7, 3, 21, 0, 17, 14, 25, 28, 12, 29, 21, 3, 9, 22>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
- There are 12 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [12].
