Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. (10, 1, 7, 11)
2. (10, 9, 11, 6)
3. (10, 9, 14, 4)
4. (10, 9, 14, 8)
5. (10, 12, 6, 11)
6. (10, 13, 7, 11)
7. (10, 2, 7, 11)
8. (11, 5, 8, 14)
9. (11, 6, 12, 10)
10. (11, 6, 1, 7)
11. (11, 9, 10, 13)
12. (4, 14, 8, 3)
13. (4, 3, 0, 5)
14. (4, 2, 7, 13)
15. (7, 13, 0, 5)
16. (7, 1, 6, 2)
17. (12, 6, 2, 10)
18. (5, 11, 7, 2)
19. (5, 8, 14, 4)
20. (13, 0, 3, 4)
21. (13, 2, 4, 14)
22. (13, 10, 2, 6)
23. (1, 14, 4, 3)
24. (1, 6, 2, 10)
25. (6, 2, 10, 13)
26. (3, 0, 5, 11)
27. (3, 4, 14, 8)
28. (9, 0, 5, 11)

Step 2: 
Out of these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <10, (1, 7), 11>
2. <10, (9, 14), 4>
3. <10, (12, 6), 11>
4. <10, (13, 7), 11>
5. <11, (5, 8), 14>
6. <11, (6, 12), 10>
7. <11, (9, 10), 13>
8. <4, (14, 8), 3>
9. <7, (1, 6), 2>
10. <13, (10, 2), 6>
11. <1, (14, 4), 3>
12. <6, (2, 10), 13>
13. <9, (0, 5), 11>

Step 3: 
The number of chordless cycles found is [15].
