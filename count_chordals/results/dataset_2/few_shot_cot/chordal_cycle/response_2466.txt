Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 4, 6, 7>
- Cycle <0, 9, 5, 3>
- Cycle <1, 3, 5, 8>
- Cycle <1, 2, 6, 7>
- Cycle <2, 3, 1, 7>
- Cycle <2, 7, 6, 4>
- Cycle <3, 5, 9, 8>
- Cycle <5, 9, 2, 7>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle <0, 4, 6, 7> has a chord (4, 7).
- Cycle <0, 9, 5, 3> has a chord (9, 3).
- Cycle <1, 3, 5, 8> has a chord (3, 5).
- Cycle <1, 2, 6, 7> has a chord (2, 7).
- Cycle <2, 3, 1, 7> has a chord (3, 7).
- Cycle <2, 7, 6, 4> has a chord (7, 6).
- Cycle <3, 5, 9, 8> has no chords.
- Cycle <5, 9, 2, 7> has no chords.

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [6] 

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 4, 6, 7>, chord (4, 7)
<0, 9, 5, 3>, chord (9, 3)
<1, 3, 5, 8>, chord (3, 5)
<1, 2, 6, 7>, chord (2, 7)
<2, 3, 1, 7>, chord (3, 7)
<2, 7, 6, 4>, chord (7, 6)
