Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 12) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 14) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 13) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 13) (3, 12) (3, 4) (10, 11) (10, 6) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 3) (11, 10) (11, 13) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 13) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 12) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (13, 5) (13, 1) (13, 3) (13, 11) (13, 4) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 12) (7, 9) (7, 10) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 14) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 8) (12, 0) (6, 1) (6, 10) (6, 7) (14, 9) (14, 7)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph where every edge in the cycle exists. 

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 11, 13, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 9, 5, 12, 2)
- Cycle 3: (4, 3, 13, 5, 4)
- Cycle 4: (7, 9, 5, 12, 7)
- Cycle 5: (0, 1, 3, 12, 0)
- Cycle 6: (6, 1, 3, 4, 6)
- Cycle 7: (10, 11, 1, 6, 10)
- Cycle 8: (14, 9, 7, 0, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (13, 3), 11>
- <2, (12, 9), 5>
- <4, (5, 13), 3>
- <7, (5, 9), 12>
- <0, (1, 3), 12>
- <6, (3, 1), 4>
- <10, (6, 1), 11>
- <14, (9, 7), 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the final count is [8].
