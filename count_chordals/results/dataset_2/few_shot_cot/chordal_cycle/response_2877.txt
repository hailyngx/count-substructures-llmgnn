Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 6, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 6, 1, 8>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 8, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 4, 6, 7, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 2, 9, 8>
- Cycle 6: <2, 6, 4, 3, 9>
- Cycle 7: <3, 4, 6, 9, 3>
- Cycle 8: <3, 4, 0, 7, 8>
- Cycle 9: <5, 7, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 10: <5, 8, 7, 6, 4>
- Cycle 11: <9, 6, 4, 0, 3>
- Cycle 12: <9, 8, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 13: <9, 8, 1, 6, 2>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 6, 2, 1> has a chord: (4, 6)
- <0, 4, 6, 1, 8> has a chord: (4, 6)
- <0, 7, 8, 5, 0> has a chord: (7, 8)
- <1, 4, 6, 7, 0> has a chord: (4, 7)
- <1, 6, 2, 9, 8> has no chords
- <2, 6, 4, 3, 9> has a chord: (4, 3)
- <3, 4, 6, 9, 3> has a chord: (4, 9)
- <3, 4, 0, 7, 8> has a chord: (4, 7)
- <5, 7, 6, 1, 4> has no chords
- <5, 8, 7, 6, 4> has no chords
- <9, 6, 4, 0, 3> has no chords
- <9, 8, 7, 5, 0> has no chords
- <9, 8, 1, 6, 2> has no chords

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 6, 2, 9, 8>
- <5, 7, 6, 1, 4>
- <5, 8, 7, 6, 4>
- <9, 6, 4, 0, 3>
- <9, 8, 7, 5, 0>
