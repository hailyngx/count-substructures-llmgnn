- Cycle 2: <1, (11, 14), 4>
- Cycle 3: <1, (7, 14), 4>
- Cycle 4: <13, (2, 12), 4>

- Cycle 6: <9, (0, 13), 7>
- Cycle 7: <7, (3, 12), 5>
- Cycle 8: <7, (8, 9), 6>
- Cycle 9: <7, (8, 9), 5>
- Cycle 10: <9, (2, 14), 7>
- Cycle 11: <4, (7, 13), 5>
- Cycle 12: <4, (13, 6), 5>
- Cycle 13: <7, (4, 13), 9>
- Cycle 14: <7, (13, 8), 6>
- Cycle 15: <7, (13, 8), 6>
- Cycle 16: <11, (3, 9), 7>
- Cycle 17: <11, (3, 9), 7>
- Cycle 18: <7, (0, 10), 9>
- Cycle 19: <7, (0, 13), 12>
- Cycle 20: <6, (7, 9), 5>
- Cycle 21: <6, (0, 13), 12>
- Cycle 22: <6, (13, 2), 11>
- Cycle 23: <8, (7, 5), 12>
- Cycle 24: <8, (7, 5), 12>
- Cycle 25: <3, (4, 13), 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 25 chordal 4-cycles found in total, so the final count is [25].
