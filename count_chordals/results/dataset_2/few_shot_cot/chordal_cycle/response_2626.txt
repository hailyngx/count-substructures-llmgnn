Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
1. <0, 6, 5, 13>
2. <0, 6, 14, 8>
3. <0, 6, 10, 7>
4. <0, 14, 12, 2>
5. <1, 3, 10, 6>
6. <1, 3, 2, 7>
7. <1, 2, 12, 13>
8. <2, 7, 6, 14>
9. <3, 1, 12, 13>
10. <5, 4, 7, 6>
11. <5, 4, 11, 8>
12. <5, 7, 10, 6>
13. <5, 13, 9, 14>
14. <6, 7, 4, 5>
15. <6, 10, 0, 14>
16. <6, 14, 0, 10>
17. <7, 4, 11, 8>
18. <9, 3, 1, 12>
19. <9, 13, 5, 7>
20. <9, 14, 8, 11>
21. <9, 10, 0, 6>
22. <10, 7, 4, 11>
23. <10, 9, 13, 5>
24. <10, 6, 0, 14>
25. <11, 8, 14, 12>
26. <12, 1, 3, 10>
27. <12, 13, 9, 14>
28. <13, 5, 4, 11>
29. <14, 8, 11, 4>
30. <14, 9, 13, 5>

Step 2: Checking for one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 6, 5, 13>: Chord = (6, 5)
- <1, 3, 10, 6>: Chord = (1, 10)
- <2, 7, 6, 14>: Chord = (2, 14)
- <5, 4, 7, 6>: Chord = (5, 7)
- <6, 14, 0, 10>: Chord = (6, 0)
- <9, 3, 1, 12>: Chord = (9, 1)
- <5, 13, 9, 14>: Chord = (5, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 30 cycles in total, and the number of chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord is [7].
