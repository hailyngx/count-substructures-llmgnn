Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 6, 4, 1, 0), chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 3, 9, 1), chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle 3: (1, 4, 2, 5, 1), chord: (2, 5)
- Cycle 4: (1, 3, 0, 6, 1), chord: (0, 6)
- Cycle 5: (2, 5, 7, 8, 2), chord: (2, 7)
- Cycle 6: (3, 9, 1, 6, 3), chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 7: (3, 6, 4, 0, 3), chord: (0, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 6, 0, 1, 4), chord: (0, 1)
- Cycle 9: (5, 9, 3, 8, 5), chord: (3, 8)
- Cycle 10: (5, 7, 8, 2, 5), chord: (2, 8)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Out of the above cycles, the following cycles have exactly one chord:
<1, (1, 6)>  
<2, (1, 9)>  
<3, (2, 5)>
<4, (0, 6)>  
<5, (2, 7)>  
<6, (1, 6)>  
<7, (0, 4)>  
<8, (0, 1)>  
<9, (3, 8)>  
<10, (2, 8)>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [0]
