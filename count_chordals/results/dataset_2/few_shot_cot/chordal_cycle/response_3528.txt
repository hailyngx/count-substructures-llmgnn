- Cycle 27: (1, 2, 5, 9)
- Cycle 28: (1, 2, 7, 9)
- Cycle 29: (1, 2, 5, 0)
- Cycle 30: (1, 2, 7, 9)
- Cycle 31: (3, 9, 8, 6)
- Cycle 32: (3, 9, 8, 0)
- Cycle 33: (3, 9, 8, 1)

- Cycle 40: (0, 5, 9, 8)
- Cycle 41: (0, 5, 1, 4)
- Cycle 42: (0, 5, 6, 8)
- Cycle 43: (7, 9, 8, 6)
- Cycle 44: (7, 9, 3, 0)
- Cycle 45: (7, 9, 8, 6)
- Cycle 46: (7, 9, 8, 1)
- Cycle 47: (8, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 48: (6, 1, 4, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
From the listed cycles above, the following cycles have exactly one chord:
- <5, (6, 8), 9>: Chord: (6, 8)
- <5, (0, 7), 9>: Chord: (0, 7)
- <5, (3, 8), 9>: Chord: (3, 8)
- <5, (1, 4), 6>: Chord: (1, 4)
- <5, (1, 2), 6>: Chord: (1, 2)
- <5, (7, 0), 9>: Chord: (7, 0)
- <3, (0, 9), 8>: Chord: (0, 9)
- <3, (0, 7), 9>: Chord: (0, 7)
- <3, (7, 2), 9>: Chord: (7, 2)
- <2, (1, 4), 5>: Chord: (1, 4)
- <2, (5, 6), 8>: Chord: (5, 6)
- <0, (5, 6), 1>: Chord: (5, 6)
- <0, (5, 9), 8>: Chord: (5, 9)
- <7, (9, 8), 6>: Chord: (9, 8)
- <7, (9, 3), 0>: Chord: (9, 3)
- <7, (8, 1), 9>: Chord: (8, 1)
- <7, (9, 3), 8>: Chord: (9, 3)
- <6, (1, 4), 2>: Chord: (1, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 32 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [32].
