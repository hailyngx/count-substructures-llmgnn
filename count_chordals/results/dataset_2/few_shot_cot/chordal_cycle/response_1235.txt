Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 14, 17, 7, 0>
- <0, 14, 4, 7, 0>
- <0, 10, 17, 7, 0>
- <0, 18, 8, 4, 7, 0>
- <0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 0>
- <2, 5, 6, 16, 14, 17, 10, 0, 18, 15, 12, 2>
- <4, 7, 6, 16, 14, 17, 10, 0, 18, 15, 12, 4>
- <4, 8, 16, 14, 17, 10, 0, 18, 15, 12, 4>
- <4, 11, 13, 2, 5, 6, 7, 0, 18, 15, 12, 4>
- <8, 19, 9, 18, 15, 12, 2, 5, 6, 16, 8>

Step 2: Checking for chords:
- <0, 14, 4, 7, 0> has a chord as (14, 7)
- <4, 7, 6, 16, 14, 17, 10, 0, 18, 15, 12, 4> has a chord as (16, 10)
- <4, 11, 13, 2, 5, 6, 7, 0, 18, 15, 12, 4> has a chord as (13, 2)
- <8, 19, 9, 18, 15, 12, 2, 5, 6, 16, 8> has a chord as (15, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 6 chordless cycles found in the graph: <0, 14, 17, 7, 0>, <0, 10, 17, 7, 0>, <0, 18, 8, 4, 7, 0>, <0, 2, 5, 6, 7, 0>, <2, 5, 6, 16, 14, 17, 10, 0, 18, 15, 12, 2>, <4, 8, 16, 14, 17, 10, 0, 18, 15, 12, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
