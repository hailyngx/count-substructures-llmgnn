Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (7, 1) (7, 0) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 4, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles with length 4:
- (0, 6, 3, 1, 0)
- (0, 6, 5, 3, 0)
- (0, 6, 8, 7, 0)
- (0, 4, 1, 8, 0)
- (0, 4, 3, 5, 0)
- (1, 3, 6, 5, 1)
- (1, 3, 4, 0, 1)
- (1, 4, 9, 2, 1)
- (1, 4, 3, 5, 1)
- (2, 9, 4, 0, 2)
- (2, 9, 3, 5, 2)
- (3, 6, 5, 8, 3)
- (3, 6, 8, 2, 3)
- (3, 4, 1, 7, 3)
- (4, 9, 2, 8, 4)
- (4, 9, 3, 1, 4)
- (5, 6, 3, 9, 5)
- (6, 9, 4, 0, 6)
- (7, 1, 4, 9, 7)
- (8, 6, 5, 3, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal cycles:
- <1, (2, 8), 4, 3>
- <1, (4, 9), 2, 3>
- <4, (0, 9), 2, 3>
- <5, (6, 9), 4, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 20 chordless cycles. Therefore, the final count is [20].
