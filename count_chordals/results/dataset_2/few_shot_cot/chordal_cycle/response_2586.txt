Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 2, 5>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 2, 1>
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 5, 2>
- Cycle 6: <0, 1, 5, 8>
- Cycle 7: <0, 1, 3, 4>
- Cycle 8: <1, 5, 4, 7>
- Cycle 9: <1, 5, 4, 3>
- Cycle 10: <1, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 11: <1, 5, 8, 4>
- Cycle 12: <1, 3, 4, 7>
- Cycle 13: <1, 3, 4, 6>
- Cycle 14: <2, 5, 1, 3>
- Cycle 15: <2, 5, 1, 0>
- Cycle 16: <2, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 17: <2, 5, 8, 4>
- Cycle 18: <2, 1, 3, 4>
- Cycle 19: <2, 1, 3, 6>
- Cycle 20: <3, 4, 7, 0>
- Cycle 21: <3, 4, 7, 2>
- Cycle 22: <3, 4, 6, 8>
- Cycle 23: <3, 4, 6, 0>

Step 2: Identifying Chordal Cycles:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <0, 7, 4, 5> (Chord: (4, 7))
- Chordal Cycle 2: <0, 7, 2, 1> (Chord: (0, 2))
- Chordal Cycle 3: <0, 1, 5, 2> (Chord: (1, 5))
- Chordal Cycle 4: <1, 5, 4, 7> (Chord: (1, 4))
- Chordal Cycle 5: <1, 3, 4, 7> (Chord: (1, 4))
- Chordal Cycle 6: <2, 5, 1, 3> (Chord: (5, 1))
- Chordal Cycle 7: <3, 4, 6, 0> (Chord: (3, 6))
- Chordal Cycle 8: <3, 4, 6, 8> (Chord: (4, 6))

Step 3: Counting Chordless Cycles:
There are a total of 8 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, so the final count is given as [8].
