Response:
Since we have 15 nodes and 60 edges in this graph, we will first list all cycles of length 4 or more:  
- <0, 10, 13, 3>
- <0, 9, 14, 3>
- <0, 9, 14, 5>
- <0, 9, 7, 1>
- <0, 11, 4, 8>
- <1, 6, 14, 3>
- <1, 6, 14, 5>
- <1, 6, 14, 9>
- <1, 7, 12, 3>
- <1, 7, 12, 13>
- <2, 8, 4, 3>
- <2, 8, 4, 9>
- <2, 8, 11, 4>
- <2, 10, 5, 4>
- <2, 10, 5, 14>
- <3, 4, 8, 7>
- <3, 4, 9, 14>
- <3, 12, 7, 1>
- <3, 12, 13, 11>
- <4, 8, 11, 0>
- <4, 9, 0, 11>
- <4, 9, 14, 5>
- <5, 10, 2, 8>
- <5, 10, 13, 3>
- <6, 1, 7, 12>
- <7, 8, 4, 3>
- <8, 11, 13, 3>
- <9, 0, 11, 13>
- <10, 1, 7, 12>
- <11, 4, 9, 0>

Next, we need to check each of these cycles for exactly one chord:
- <0, 10, 13, 3> has chord (10, 13)
- <0, 9, 14, 3> has chord (9, 14)
- <0, 9, 14, 5> has chord (9, 14)
- <0, 9, 7, 1> has chord (7, 1)
- <0, 11, 4, 8> has chord (11, 4)
- <1, 6, 14, 3> has chord (6, 14)
- <1, 6, 14, 5> has chord (6, 14)
- <1, 6, 14, 9> has chord (6, 14)
- <1, 7, 12, 3> has chord (7, 12)
- <1, 7, 12, 13> has chord (12, 13)
- <2, 8, 4, 3> has chord (8, 4)
- <2, 8, 4, 9> has chord (8, 4)
- <2, 8, 11, 4> has chord (11, 4)
- <2, 10, 5, 4> has chord (10, 5)
- <2, 10, 5, 14> has chord (5, 14)
- <3, 4, 8, 7> has chord (4, 8)
- <3, 4, 9, 14> has chord (4, 9)
- <3, 12, 7, 1> has chord (12, 7)
- <3, 12, 13, 11> has chord (12, 13)
- <4, 8, 11, 0> has chord (11, 0)
- <4, 9, 0, 11> has chord (9, 0)
- <4, 9, 14, 5> has chord (9, 14)
- <5, 10, 2, 8> has chord (10, 2)
- <5, 10, 13, 3> has chord (10, 13)
- <6, 1, 7, 12> has chord (1, 7)
- <7, 8, 4, 3> has chord (8, 4)
- <8, 11, 13, 3> has chord (11, 13)
- <9, 0, 11, 13> has chord (0, 11)
- <10, 1, 7, 12> has chord (1, 7)
- <11, 4, 9, 0> has chord (4, 9)

From the above analysis, we can see that all cycles have exactly one chord. Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [29].
