Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph where every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 5, 14, 9>
- <0, 14, 13, 9>
- <0, 12, 1, 13>
- <0, 5, 4, 8>
- <1, 13, 9, 8>
- <1, 8, 7, 4>
- <2, 9, 14, 13>
- <2, 13, 9, 8>
- <3, 7, 4, 8>
- <3, 10, 14, 9>
- <5, 4, 7, 3>
- <5, 14, 9, 8>
- <5, 14, 13, 9>
- <7, 4, 8, 9>
- <9, 8, 4, 7>
- <10, 3, 7, 4>
- <10, 14, 9, 8>
- <11, 6, 12, 1>
- <12, 6, 11, 7>
- <12, 11, 7, 4>
- <13, 9, 8, 7>
- <13, 2, 8, 4>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 5, 14, 9> has chord 5-9
- Cycle <0, 14, 13, 9> has chord 14-9
- Cycle <0, 12, 1, 13> has chord 12-1
- Cycle <0, 5, 4, 8> has chord 5-8
- Cycle <1, 13, 9, 8> has chord 13-8
- Cycle <1, 8, 7, 4> has chord 8-4
- Cycle <2, 9, 14, 13> has chord 9-13
- Cycle <2, 13, 9, 8> has chord 13-8
- Cycle <3, 7, 4, 8> has chord 7-8
- Cycle <3, 10, 14, 9> has chord 10-14
- Cycle <5, 4, 7, 3> has chord 4-7
- Cycle <5, 14, 9, 8> has chord 14-8
- Cycle <5, 14, 13, 9> has chord 14-9
- Cycle <7, 4, 8, 9> has chord 4-9
- Cycle <9, 8, 4, 7> has chord 8-7
- Cycle <10, 3, 7, 4> has chord 3-7
- Cycle <10, 14, 9, 8> has chord 14-9
- Cycle <11, 6, 12, 1> has chord 6-12
- Cycle <12, 6, 11, 7> has chord 6-11
- Cycle <12, 11, 7, 4> has chord 11-4
- Cycle <13, 9, 8, 7> has chord 9-8
- Cycle <13, 2, 8, 4> has chord 2-8

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are [0] chordal 4-cycles found in the graph.
