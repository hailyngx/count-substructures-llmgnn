Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 0, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 1-5-6-4-0-3-1 with edges (1, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (4, 0), (0, 3), (3, 1)
2. Cycle 1-5-6-8-2-9-3 with edges (1, 5), (5, 6), (6, 8), (8, 2), (2, 9), (9, 3)
3. Cycle 1-9-8-7-3-0-4 with edges (1, 9), (9, 8), (8, 7), (7, 3), (3, 0), (0, 4)
4. Cycle 1-9-3-2-8-6-5 with edges (1, 9), (9, 3), (3, 2), (2, 8), (8, 6), (6, 5)
5. Cycle 1-3-0-4-7-8-2 with edges (1, 3), (3, 0), (0, 4), (4, 7), (7, 8), (8, 2)
6. Cycle 3-9-2-8-7-4-0 with edges (3, 9), (9, 2), (2, 8), (8, 7), (7, 4), (4, 0)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle) are:
1. Cycle 1-5-6-4-0-3-1 with chord (4, 3) => <1, (4, 3), 5>
2. Cycle 1-3-0-4-7-8-2 with chord (4, 8) => <2, (4, 8), 1>
3. Cycle 3-9-2-8-7-4-0 with chord (2, 7) => <3, (2, 7), 9>

Step 3:
Total number of chordal 4-cycles found: [3]
