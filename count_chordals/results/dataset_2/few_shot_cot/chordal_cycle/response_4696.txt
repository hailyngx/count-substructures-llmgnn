        - Cycle 30: <9, 14, 12, 1>
        - Cycle 31: <9, 2, 1, 13>
        - Cycle 32: <10, 8, 4, 14>
        - Cycle 33: <10, 8, 3, 0>
        - Cycle 34: <10, 8, 7, 9>
        - Cycle 35: <10, 13, 1, 12>
        - Cycle 36: <11, 5, 2, 1>
        - Cycle 37: <11, 5, 12, 1>
        - Cycle 38: <11, 4, 14, 9>
        - Cycle 39: <11, 4, 3, 0>
        - Cycle 40: <11, 9, 7, 10>

        - Cycle 49: <14, 4, 3, 8>
        - Cycle 50: <14, 4, 12, 1>
        - Cycle 51: <14, 9, 11, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Two chordal 4-cycles are found:
            - <0, 3, 4, 14>, with chord (12, 1)
            - <10, 8, 4, 14>, with chord (9, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        - There are 49 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [49].
