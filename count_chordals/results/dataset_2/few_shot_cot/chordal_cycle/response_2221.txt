Step 2: Checking for chords:

- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 4, 1, 5> with chords (0, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 4, 7, 12> with chords (4, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 2, 13, 8> with chords (2, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 2, 12, 14> with chords (2, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 4, 7, 12> with chords (4, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 5, 13, 8> with chords (5, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 11, 7> with chords (9, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 13, 8, 11> with chords (13, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 13, 8, 11> with chords (13, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

- Number of chordless cycles = [13]
