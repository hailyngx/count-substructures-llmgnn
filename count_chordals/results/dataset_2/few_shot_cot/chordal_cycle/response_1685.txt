Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <3, (14, 27), 29>.

Going through the steps:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 3 - 9 - 1 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 2: 3 - 1 - 19 - 12 - 27 - 14 - 3
- Cycle 3: 3 - 14 - 27 - 19 - 1 - 9 - 3
- Cycle 4: 3 - 14 - 29 - 16 - 26 - 8 - 4 - 13 - 11 - 10 - 23 - 3
- Cycle 5: 14 - 29 - 16 - 0 - 8 - 12 - 19 - 27 - 14
- Cycle 6: 29 - 20 - 9 - 3 - 14 - 27 - 12 - 8 - 0 - 16 - 29
- Cycle 7: 27 - 19 - 1 - 5 - 9 - 3 - 14 - 27
- Cycle 8: 29 - 16 - 0 - 8 - 4 - 13 - 11 - 22 - 0       

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: No chord present.
- Cycle 2: No chord present.
- Cycle 3: No chord present.
- Cycle 4: No chord present.
- Cycle 5: No chord present.
- Cycle 6: No chord present.
- Cycle 7: Chord (14, 27) present.
- Cycle 8: No chord present.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [7].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle is <3, (14, 27), 29>, and the number of chordless cycles in the graph is [7].
