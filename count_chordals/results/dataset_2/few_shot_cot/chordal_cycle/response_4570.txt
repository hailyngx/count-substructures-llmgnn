Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <3, (13, 19), 12>. 

Following the steps mentioned earlier:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (3, 16, 15, 18, 17, 11, 16)
- Cycle 2: (3, 16, 6, 2, 12, 13, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 16, 6, 9, 1, 13, 3)
- Cycle 4: (3, 19, 12, 2, 6, 16, 3)
- Cycle 5: (3, 19, 12, 13, 8, 10, 0, 3)
- Cycle 6: (3, 19, 12, 13, 1, 9, 18, 17, 11, 16, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Only Cycle 4: (3, 16, 6, 2, 12, 13, 3) has exactly one chord 13-19.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found: <3, (13, 19), 12> which represents a chordal 4-cycle.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].
