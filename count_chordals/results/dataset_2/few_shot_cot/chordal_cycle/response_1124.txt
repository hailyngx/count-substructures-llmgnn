Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 5) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 2) (5, 8) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 7, 3, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle <6, 7, 1, 5>
2. Cycle <9, 4, 7, 1>
3. Cycle <4, 2, 3, 5>
4. Cycle <9, 3, 5, 2, 4>
5. Cycle <6, 5, 3, 1>
6. Cycle <0, 2, 8, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

After checking each cycle, we find that cycle <6, 7, 1, 5> has exactly one chord (1, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <6, 7, 1, 5>, with chord (1, 5).
