Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with the given edges are as follows:
- Cycle <4, 6, 5, 13>
- Cycle <4, 14, 8, 12>
- Cycle <4, 14, 11, 3>
- Cycle <4, 14, 9, 0>
- Cycle <6, 5, 2, 10>
- Cycle <6, 5, 1, 13>
- Cycle <6, 10, 12, 8>
- Cycle <6, 10, 2, 5>
- Cycle <6, 10, 12, 4>
- Cycle <5, 2, 3, 11>
- Cycle <5, 1, 7, 8>
- Cycle <5, 1, 13, 4>
- Cycle <5, 1, 11, 2>
- Cycle <2, 10, 12, 4>
- Cycle <2, 10, 6, 5>
- Cycle <2, 5, 1, 13>
- Cycle <2, 5, 6, 10>
- Cycle <2, 3, 14, 11>
- Cycle <2, 3, 9, 0>
- Cycle <8, 12, 10, 6>
- Cycle <8, 12, 4, 14>
- Cycle <8, 12, 10, 2>
- Cycle <8, 14, 4, 13>
- Cycle <8, 14, 0, 9>
- Cycle <1, 13, 4, 14>
- Cycle <1, 13, 5, 6>
- Cycle <1, 13, 4, 12>
- Cycle <1, 11, 3, 9>
- Cycle <1, 11, 0, 14>
- Cycle <12, 4, 13, 5>
- Cycle <12, 8, 14, 4>
- Cycle <12, 8, 14, 0>
- Cycle <10, 2, 5, 6>
- Cycle <10, 2, 6, 4>
- Cycle <10, 2, 3, 11>

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, 6, 5, 13>, chord: (5, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, 14, 8, 12>, chord: (8, 12)

Step 3:
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [33].
