Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 8, 15, 4, 2>
2. <0, 14, 2, 4, 16>
3. <0, 3, 10, 11, 12>
4. <0, 3, 7, 19, 0>
5. <0, 19, 7, 3, 2>
6. <1, 17, 16, 4, 15>
7. <1, 13, 12, 11, 10>
8. <2, 4, 8, 15, 7>
9. <2, 3, 7, 19, 0>
10. <3, 7, 9, 18, 13>
11. <10, 11, 12, 17, 16>

Step 2:  
Identifying the chordal 4-cycles:
- In cycle 1: <0, 8, 15, 4, 2>, the chord is between 8 and 4.
- In cycle 9: <2, 3, 7, 19, 0>, the chord is between 3 and 19.

Step 3:  
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is [2]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:  
<0, 8, 15, 4, 2>  
<2, 3, 7, 19, 0>
