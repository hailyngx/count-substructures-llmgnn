4. <0, 4, 5, 8, 0>
5. <0, 4, 6, 9, 0>
6. <0, 7, 8, 1, 0>
7. <0, 7, 8, 6, 0>
8. <0, 7, 8, 9, 0>
9. <1, 6, 4, 5, 1>
10. <1, 6, 4, 0, 1>
11. <1, 6, 9, 8, 1>
12. <2, 4, 6, 1, 2>
13. <2, 4, 6, 9, 2>
14. <2, 4, 7, 8, 2>
15. <2, 7, 8, 6, 2>
16. <4, 6, 9, 8, 4>
17. <4, 7, 8, 5, 4>
18. <5, 4, 6, 1, 5>
19. <5, 8, 7, 4, 5>
20. <6, 4, 7, 8, 6>

2. <0, 7, 8, 6, 0> (chord: (7, 6))
3. <1, 6, 4, 5, 1> (chord: (6, 5))
4. <1, 6, 9, 8, 1> (chord: (6, 8))
5. <2, 4, 6, 1, 2> (chord: (4, 1))
6. <2, 4, 7, 8, 2> (chord: (4, 8))
7. <4, 6, 9, 8, 4> (chord: (6, 8))
8. <4, 7, 8, 5, 4> (chord: (7, 5))
9. <5, 4, 6, 1, 5> (chord: (4, 1))
10. <5, 8, 7, 4, 5> (chord: (8, 7))
