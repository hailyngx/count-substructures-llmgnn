Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (13, 22, 19, 24)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (13, 22, 25, 23)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (13, 21, 2, 4)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (13, 5, 15, 1)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (22, 9, 29, 24)
- Cycle with 4 nodes: (22, 19, 14, 16)
- Cycle with 5 nodes: (10, 28, 1, 15, 2)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle (13, 22, 19, 24) has a chord (13, 19)
- Cycle (13, 22, 25, 23) has a chord (13, 25)
- Cycle (13, 21, 2, 4) has a chord (13, 2)
- Cycle (13, 5, 15, 1) has a chord (13, 15)
- Cycle (22, 9, 29, 24) has a chord (22, 29)
- Cycle (22, 19, 14, 16) has a chord (22, 14)
- Cycle (10, 28, 1, 15, 2) has a chord (10, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: 
- There are 0 chordless 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
