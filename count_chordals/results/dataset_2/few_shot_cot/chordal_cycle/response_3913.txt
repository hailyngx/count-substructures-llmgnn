Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- There is a 4-cycle: <0, 5, 4, 6>
- There is a 4-cycle: <1, 9, 4, 3>
- There is a 4-cycle: <2, 5, 8, 1>
- There is a 4-cycle: <3, 4, 9, 1>
- There is a 4-cycle: <5, 6, 2, 8>
- There is a 4-cycle: <0, 5, 8, 9>
- There is a 4-cycle: <0, 1, 8, 2>
- There is a 4-cycle: <0, 3, 7, 0>
- There is a 4-cycle: <1, 9, 8, 5>
- There is a 4-cycle: <4, 5, 8, 9>
- There is a 4-cycle: <4, 6, 2, 5>
- There is a 4-cycle: <4, 9, 8, 1>
- There is a 4-cycle: <5, 8, 1, 9>
- There is a 4-cycle: <0, 3, 1, 9>
- There is a 4-cycle: <0, 6, 2, 8>
- There is a 4-cycle: <0, 9, 1, 3>
- There is a 4-cycle: <0, 6, 4, 3>
- There is a 4-cycle: <3, 0, 1, 9>
- There is a 4-cycle: <3, 4, 5, 8>
- There is a 4-cycle: <6, 4, 9, 8>
- There is a 4-cycle: <8, 5, 4, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Among the cycles above, only the cycle <0, 5, 4, 6> has exactly one chord: (0, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 21 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph: [21]
