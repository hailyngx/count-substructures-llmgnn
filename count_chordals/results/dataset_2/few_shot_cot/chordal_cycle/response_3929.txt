- 4-7-10-8-4
- 4-7-11-8-4
- 4-7-2-5-4
- 4-9-14-13-4
- 4-9-13-5-4

- 4-9-3-5-4
- 7-11-1-6-7
- 7-11-12-6-7
- 7-8-10-6-7
- 7-8-11-12-7
- 7-10-9-14-7
- 7-10-6-1-7
- 7-10-9-1-7
- 7-2-0-14-7
- 7-2-5-13-7
- 7-5-3-6-7

- 12-2-7-10-12
- 12-5-13-9-12
- 12-5-3-6-12
- 12-11-8-7-12
- 6-1-9-4-6
- 6-3-5-13-6
- 6-10-7-8-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <4, (7, 10), 8>
- <4, (7, 11), 8>
- <4, (7, 2), 5>
- <4, (9, 14), 13>
- <4, (9, 13), 5>
- <4, (12, 2), 5>
- <4, (12, 11), 7>
- <4, (12, 6), 3>
- <4, (9, 1), 6>
- <4, (9, 3), 5>
- <7, (11, 1), 6>
- <7, (11, 12), 6>
- <7, (8, 10), 6>
- <7, (8, 11), 12>
- <7, (10, 9), 14>
- <7, (10, 6), 1>
- <7, (10, 9), 1>
- <7, (2, 0), 14>
- <7, (2, 5), 13>
- <7, (5, 3), 6>
- <7, (5, 13), 9>
- <11, (1, 6), 12>
- <11, (1, 9), 4>
- <11, (8, 7), 10>
- <11, (12, 5), 13>
- <11, (12, 6), 3>
- <12, (2, 0), 14>
- <12, (2, 7), 10>
- <12, (5, 13), 9>
- <12, (5, 3), 6>
- <12, (11, 8), 7>
- <6, (1, 9), 4>
- <6, (3, 5), 13>
- <6, (10, 7), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 31 chordal 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [31].
