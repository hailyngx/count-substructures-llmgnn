Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (14, 0, 29, 21, 16, 17, 9, 10)
- Cycle 2: (14, 0, 12, 7, 15, 23, 4, 26)
- Cycle 3: (14, 0, 12, 7, 8, 11, 23, 15)
- Cycle 4: (14, 12, 7, 8, 28, 3, 5, 19)
- Cycle 5: (14, 12, 0, 29, 22, 24, 19, 17)
- Cycle 6: (14, 0, 29, 22, 24, 18, 20, 18)
- Cycle 7: (14, 12, 0, 29, 22, 24, 2, 16)
- Cycle 8: (14, 1, 25, 26, 4, 23, 15, 7)
- Cycle 9: (14, 1, 5, 3, 6, 27, 8, 7)
- Cycle 10: (14, 1, 5, 3, 8, 11, 23, 4)
- Cycle 11: (14, 1, 5, 3, 28, 22, 29, 0)
- Cycle 12: (14, 1, 25, 26, 10, 24, 22, 29)
- Cycle 13: (14, 12, 7, 8, 28, 22, 29, 21)
- Cycle 14: (14, 0, 29, 22, 24, 2, 5, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (14, 0), 29, (21, 16), 17> with chord (21, 16) is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <2, (14, 0), 12, (7, 15), 23> with chord (7, 15) is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <3, (14, 0), 12, (7, 8), 11> with chord (7, 8) is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <4, (14, 12), 7, (8, 28), 3> with chord (8, 28) is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <5, (14, 12), 0, (29, 22), 24> with chord (29, 22) is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <6, (14, 0), 29, (22, 24), 18> with chord (22, 24) is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <7, (14, 12), 0, (29, 22), 24> with chord (0, 29) is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <8, (14, 1), 25, (26, 4), 23> with chord (25, 26) is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <9, (14, 1), 5, (3, 6), 27> with chord (3, 6) is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <10, (14, 1), 5, (3, 8), 11> with chord (3, 8) is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <11, (14, 1), 5, (3, 28), 22> with chord (3, 28) is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <12, (14, 1), 25, (26, 10), 24> with chord (26, 10) is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <13, (14, 12), 7, (8, 28), 22> with chord (8, 28) is a chordal 4-cycle.
- <14, (14, 0), 29, (22, 24), 2> with chord (2, 24) is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is [14].
