Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 1 - 3 - 2 - 5 - 1
- Cycle 2: 1 - 14 - 0 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 3: 1 - 9 - 10 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 4: 3 - 2 - 7 - 0 - 3
- Cycle 5: 3 - 1 - 14 - 9 - 3
- Cycle 6: 10 - 11 - 8 - 9 - 10
- Cycle 7: 10 - 4 - 5 - 2 - 10
- Cycle 8: 10 - 6 - 2 - 7 - 10
- Cycle 9: 11 - 0 - 6 - 2 - 11
- Cycle 10: 11 - 8 - 7 - 2 - 11
- Cycle 11: 8 - 13 - 7 - 0 - 8
- Cycle 12: 8 - 9 - 14 - 5 - 8
- Cycle 13: 8 - 12 - 6 - 4 - 8
- Cycle 14: 13 - 7 - 2 - 5 - 13
- Cycle 15: 0 - 14 - 1 - 9 - 0
- Cycle 16: 0 - 4 - 12 - 8 - 0

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (3, 2), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (14, 0), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (9, 10), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <3, (2, 7), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, (1, 14), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <11, (8, 9), 10>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <10, (4, 5), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <10, (6, 7), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <11, (0, 6), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <11, (8, 7), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <8, (13, 7), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <8, (9, 14), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <4, (12, 6), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <13, (7, 2), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <0, (14, 1), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <0, (4, 12), 8>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles: [0]
