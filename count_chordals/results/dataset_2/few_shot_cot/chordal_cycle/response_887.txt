- Cycle 7: <19, 14, 18, 4>
- Cycle 8: <14, 18, 4, 8>
- Cycle 9: <18, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 10: <4, 8, 6, 1>
- Cycle 11: <8, 6, 1, 9>
- Cycle 12: <6, 1, 9, 12>
- Cycle 13: <1, 9, 12, 13>

- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <11, 1, 8, 5>, Chord: (1, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <14, 18, 4, 8>, Chord: (18, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <8, 6, 1, 9>, Chord: (6, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, 18, 4, 16>, Chord: (18, 4)
