Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (0, 5, 1, 6, 0)
- (0, 5, 2, 7, 9, 6, 1, 0)
- (0, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 7, 2, 0)
- (1, 5, 2, 7, 9, 6, 3, 0, 8, 4, 3, 6, 1)
- (2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 4, 8, 0, 2)

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- In cycle (0, 5, 1, 6, 0), there is a chord (1, 6)
- In cycle (0, 5, 2, 7, 9, 6, 1, 0), there is a chord (2, 7)
- In cycle (0, 5, 2, 8, 4, 9, 7, 2, 0), there is no chord
- In cycle (1, 5, 2, 7, 9, 6, 3, 0, 8, 4, 3, 6, 1), there is no chord
- In cycle (2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 4, 8, 0, 2), there is no chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 1, 5, 6, 0> with chord (1, 6)
- <0, 5, 2, 7, 9, 6, 1, 0> with chord (2, 7)
