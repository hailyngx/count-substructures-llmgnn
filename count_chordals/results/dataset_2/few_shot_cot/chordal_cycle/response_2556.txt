Response:
Step 1:  
     - The cycle 1-3-8-4 exists.
     - The cycle 0-15-12-8 exists.
     - The cycle 0-15-12-18 exists.
     - The cycle 0-12-13-2 exists.
     - The cycle 0-2-14-16 exists.
     - The cycle 0-2-17-10 exists.
     - The cycle 7-11-19-4 exists.
     - The cycle 7-11-19-16 exists.
     - The cycle 7-14-6-17 exists.
     - The cycle 7-14-2-13 exists.
     - The cycle 7-17-10-6 exists.
     - The cycle 9-16-19-5 exists.

Step 2:  
    - The cycle 0-15-12-8 has only one chord: (8, 15).
    - The cycle 0-15-12-18 has only one chord: (18, 15).
    - The cycle 0-12-13-2 has only one chord: (2, 13).
    - The cycle 7-11-19-4 has only one chord: (4, 11).
    - The cycle 7-11-19-16 has only one chord: (11, 16).
    - The cycle 7-14-6-17 has only one chord: (6, 14).
    - The cycle 7-14-2-13 has only one chord: (2, 14).
    - The cycle 7-17-10-6 has only one chord: (6, 17).

Step 3:  
    - Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]

Chordal 4-cycles:
    - <0, 15, 12, 8> with only one chord (8, 15)
    - <0, 15, 12, 18> with only one chord (18, 15)
    - <0, 12, 13, 2> with only one chord (2, 13)
    - <7, 11, 19, 4> with only one chord (4, 11)
    - <7, 11, 19, 16> with only one chord (11, 16)
    - <7, 14, 6, 17> with only one chord (6, 14)
    - <7, 14, 2, 13> with only one chord (2, 14)
    - <7, 17, 10, 6> with only one chord (6, 17)
