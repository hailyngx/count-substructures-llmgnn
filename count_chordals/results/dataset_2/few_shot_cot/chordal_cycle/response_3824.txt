Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more -

<5, 4, 15, 6>
<5, 4, 15, 2>
<5, 16, 17, 7>
<5, 16, 17, 14>
<5, 16, 13, 9>
<5, 16, 13, 18>
<5, 16, 17, 13>
<5, 19, 11, 7>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle -

<5, 4, 15, 6> has a chord (5, 6)  
<5, 4, 15, 2> has a chord (5, 2)  
<5, 16, 17, 7> has a chord (16, 7)  
<5, 16, 17, 14> has a chord (16, 14)  
<5, 16, 13, 9> has a chord (16, 9)  
<5, 16, 13, 18> has a chord (16, 18)  
<5, 16, 17, 13> has a chord (16, 17)  
<5, 19, 11, 7> has a chord (19, 7)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found -

The number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
