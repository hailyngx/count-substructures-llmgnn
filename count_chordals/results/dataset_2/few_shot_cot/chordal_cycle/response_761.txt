Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 6)

Response:
Step 1: 
- We can identify the following cycles in the given graph: 
<0, 5, 6, 1, (5, 6)> 
<0, 5, 9, 1, (5, 9)>
<0, 5, 9, 8, (5, 8)>
<0, 7, 9, 1, (7, 9)>
<0, 7, 3, 8, (7, 8)>
<0, 3, 4, 7, (3, 7)>
<0, 3, 8, 2, (3, 8)>
<0, 4, 3, 8, (4, 8)>
<0, 9, 8, 1, (9, 1)>
<0, 9, 8, 2, (9, 2)>
<1, 6, 5, 0, (6, 5)>
<1, 6, 2, 9, (6, 9)>
<1, 9, 5, 0, (9, 5)>
<1, 9, 8, 0, (9, 8)>
<1, 2, 8, 9, (2, 9)>
<3, 0, 5, 6, (0, 6)>
<3, 0, 7, 9, (0, 9)>
<3, 4, 0, 5, (4, 5)>
<3, 4, 7, 9, (4, 9)>
<3, 7, 0, 5, (7, 5)>
<4, 0, 5, 6, (0, 5)>
<4, 0, 7, 9, (0, 9)>
<5, 0, 7, 9, (0, 9)>
<5, 6, 1, 9, (6, 9)>
<7, 0, 5, 9, (0, 9)>
<7, 3, 4, 0, (3, 4)>
<9, 0, 5, 6, (0, 5)>
<9, 1, 6, 5, (1, 6)>
<9, 5, 0, 7, (5, 7)>
<9, 5, 6, 1, (5, 6)>

Step 2:
- Checking for exactly one chord in each of the identified cycles:
We find that <0, 5, 9, 1, (5, 9)>, <0, 7, 9, 1, (7, 9)>, <0, 9, 8, 1, (9, 1)>, <1, 6, 5, 0, (6, 5)> have exactly one chord in each cycle.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [4].
