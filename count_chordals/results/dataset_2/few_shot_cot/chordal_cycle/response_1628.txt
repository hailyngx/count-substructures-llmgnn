Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7

Response:
First, let's identify all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

Cycles:
1. <0, 5, 1, 6> 
2. <0, 5, 8, 7> 
3. <0, 5, 1, 4> 
4. <0, 2, 6, 1> 
5. <0, 2, 6, 4> 
6. <0, 3, 6, 1> 
7. <0, 3, 6, 4> 
8. <0, 1, 6, 4> 
9. <0, 1, 6, 9> 
10. <0, 1, 4, 7> 
11. <0, 3, 5, 8> 
12. <0, 8, 7, 9> 
13. <1, 5, 8, 7> 
14. <1, 5, 0, 3> 
15. <1, 5, 0, 2> 
16. <1, 6, 4, 7> 
17. <1, 6, 4, 9> 
18. <1, 6, 9, 7> 
19. <1, 6, 2, 0> 
20. <2, 6, 1, 5> 
21. <2, 6, 1, 0> 
22. <3, 5, 0, 1> 
23. <3, 5, 0, 2> 
24. <3, 6, 1, 5> 
25. <4, 6, 1, 5> 
26. <4, 6, 1, 0> 
27. <4, 6, 2, 0> 
28. <4, 7, 8, 5> 
29. <4, 7, 8, 0> 
30. <7, 9, 6, 3> 
31. <8, 5, 0, 1> 
32. <8, 5, 0, 3> 
33. <8, 7, 4, 6> 

Now, let's identify the unique chordal 4-cycles:
- The chordal 4-cycles in this graph are <0, 5, 1, 6> with the chord (4, 9) and <0, 5, 1, 4> with the chord (6, 9).
- Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [1].
