Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <5, 11, 23, 6>
2. <5, 11, 23, 18>
3. <5, 11, 23, 14>
4. <5, 11, 23, 19>
5. <5, 11, 23, 6, 9>
6. <5, 11, 23, 6, 22>
7. <5, 11, 23, 6, 2>
8. <5, 11, 23, 18, 2>
9. <5, 11, 23, 18, 21>
10. <5, 11, 23, 14, 28>
11. <5, 11, 23, 14, 12>
12. <5, 11, 23, 19, 13>
13. <5, 11, 23, 19, 7>
14. <5, 11, 23, 19, 14>
15. <5, 0, 22, 6>
16. <5, 0, 22, 7>
17. <5, 0, 22, 6, 9>
18. <5, 0, 22, 6, 23>
19. <5, 0, 22, 6, 2>
20. <5, 0, 22, 7, 19>
21. <5, 0, 22, 7, 17>
22. <5, 0, 22, 7, 19, 13>
23. <5, 0, 22, 7, 19, 14>
24. <5, 0, 22, 7, 17, 15>
25. <5, 0, 22, 6, 23, 11>
26. <5, 0, 22, 6, 23, 18>
27. <5, 0, 22, 6, 23, 14>
28. <5, 0, 22, 6, 23, 19>
29. <5, 0, 22, 6, 9, 13>
30. <5, 0, 22, 6, 9, 6> 
... (additional cycles)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle.
1. <5, 11, 23, 6> (Chord: (11, 6))
2. <5, 11, 23, 18> (Chord: (11, 18))
3. <5, 11, 23, 14> (Chord: (11, 14))
4. <5, 11, 23, 19> (Chord: (11, 19))
5. <5, 0, 22, 6> (Chord: (0, 6))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 0 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
