Step 2:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:

There are 92 cycles listed above. 
We now need to find the chordal 4-cycles, which are those with exactly one chord. 

Chordal cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 17, 14, 16, (19)>
- <2, 17, 14, 16, (19)>
- <5, 2, 17, 14, (16)>
- <9, 5, 2, 17, (14)>
- <10, 0, 7, 5, (2)>
- <12, 4, 19, 16, (14)>
- <13, 11, 16, 14, (19)>

Step 3:

Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord, 
the total is [7].
