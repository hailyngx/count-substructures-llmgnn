Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 10, 15, 5>: No chord
- <0, 10, 19, 3>: Chord: (10, 3)
- <1, 0, 10, 15>: No chord
- <1, 0, 13, 5>: No chord
- <2, 0, 10, 15>: Chord: (0, 15)
- <2, 0, 13, 5>: Chord: (0, 5)
- <3, 11, 19, 10>: Chord: (11, 10)
- <3, 11, 19, 0>: Chord: (11, 0)
- <3, 11, 5, 13>: Chord: (11, 13)
- <3, 16, 15, 7>: Chord: (3, 15)
- <4, 12, 13, 5>: No chord
- <5, 13, 12, 4>: No chord
- <5, 13, 0, 10>: No chord
- <5, 13, 18, 1>: No chord
- <5, 15, 10, 0>: No chord
- <5, 15, 16, 7>: No chord
- <6, 9, 7, 15>: Chord: (9, 15)
- <7, 9, 6, 2>: Chord: (9, 6)
- <7, 9, 6, 17>: Chord: (9, 6)
- <7, 9, 17, 6>: Chord: (9, 17)
- <7, 15, 10, 0>: No chord
- <7, 15, 16, 3>: Chord: (15, 3)
- <7, 17, 6, 2>: Chord: (17, 2)
- <7, 17, 6, 9>: Chord: (17, 9)
- <10, 15, 5, 13>: No chord
- <10, 19, 3, 11>: No chord
- <11, 3, 19, 10>: No chord
- <11, 3, 16, 15>: Chord: (3, 15)
- <13, 0, 10, 15>: No chord
- <13, 5, 3, 11>: No chord
- <13, 5, 15, 10>: No chord
- <15, 7, 9, 6>: No chord
- <15, 10, 0, 1>: No chord
- <15, 10, 19, 3>: Chord: (10, 3)
- <15, 16, 7, 9>: No chord
- <16, 3, 11, 19>: No chord
- <16, 7, 9, 6>: No chord
- <16, 7, 15, 10>: Chord: (7, 10)
- <18, 1, 0, 10>: No chord
- <18, 1, 5, 13>: No chord

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles: 29
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [29].
