Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:

- <2, 7, 12, 6>
- <2, 10, 7, 14>
- <2, 13, 6, 1>
- <3, 5, 0, 6>
- <3, 8, 4, 14>
- <3, 10, 7, 12>
- <3, 11, 1, 6>
- <6, 1, 11, 9>
- <6, 12, 7, 14>
- <7, 10, 2, 8>
- <7, 14, 13, 2>
- <9, 1, 6, 13>
- <9, 10, 7, 14>
- <10, 7, 12, 0>

- <11, 3, 8, 2>
- <11, 13, 6, 12>
- <13, 14, 7, 10>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 4, 8, 2>  [Chord: (4, 8)]
- <0, 5, 3, 8>  [Chord: (5, 8)]
- <0, 6, 12, 7>  [Chord: (6, 12)]
- <0, 13, 14, 7>  [Chord: (13, 14)]
- <1, 6, 12, 0>  [Chord: (6, 12)]
- <1, 11, 3, 8>  [Chord: (11, 8)]
- <1, 13, 14, 7>  [Chord: (13, 14)]
- <2, 3, 8, 4>  [Chord: (3, 4)]
- <2, 7, 12, 6>  [Chord: (7, 12)]
- <2, 10, 7, 14>  [Chord: (10, 7)]
- <2, 13, 6, 1>  [Chord: (13, 6)]
- <3, 5, 0, 6>  [Chord: (5, 6)]
- <3, 8, 4, 14>  [Chord: (4, 14)]

- <3, 11, 1, 6>  [Chord: (1, 6)]
- <6, 1, 11, 9>  [Chord: (1, 11)]
- <6, 12, 7, 14>  [Chord: (7, 14)]
- <7, 10, 2, 8>  [Chord: (10, 2)]
- <7, 14, 13, 2>  [Chord: (13, 2)]
- <9, 1, 6, 13>  [Chord: (1, 6)]
- <9, 10, 7, 14>  [Chord: (10, 7)]
- <10, 7, 12, 0>  [Chord: (7, 12)]
- <10, 9, 1, 6>  [Chord: (9, 1)]
- <11, 3, 8, 2>  [Chord: (3, 8)]
- <11, 13, 6, 12>  [Chord: (13, 6)]
- <13, 14, 7, 10>  [Chord: (7, 10)]
