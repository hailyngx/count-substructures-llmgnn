Step 2:
Checking for chords:
- <6, 9, 15, 18, 6> (Chord: 15-18)
- <6, 15, 18, 13, 6> (Chord: 15-13)
- <9, 3, 17, 1, 9> (Chord: 3-1)
- <18, 10, 7, 5, 18> (Chord: 10-5)
- <2, 10, 7, 5, 2> (Chord: 10-7)
- <0, 7, 10, 18, 0> (Chord: 7-18)
- <5, 11, 1, 17, 5> (Chord: 11-17)
- <1, 11, 2, 6, 1> (Chord: 11-2)
- <17, 8, 7, 5, 17> (Chord: 8-5)
- <15, 6, 12, 19, 15> (Chord: 6-19)

Step 3:
Counting the chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
