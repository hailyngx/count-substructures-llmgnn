Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 12, 4, 7, 11, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 14, 12, 9, 6, 11, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 14, 12, 9, 8, 10, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 8, 9, 6, 11, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 8, 7, 11, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 11, 0, 14, 12, 9, 13, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 9, 13, 4, 12, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 6, 9, 13, 1, 5, 8, 10, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 6, 9, 7, 11, 0, 14, 12, 2>
- Cycle 10: <2, 7, 4, 13, 1, 5, 8, 10, 2>
- Cycle 11: <2, 7, 4, 13, 9, 12, 2>
- Cycle 12: <3, 5, 8, 9, 13, 4, 3>
- Cycle 13: <3, 5, 8, 7, 11, 3>
- Cycle 14: <3, 11, 6, 9, 13, 4, 3>
- Cycle 15: <4, 7, 11, 0, 14, 12, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 14, (12, 4), 7, 11, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 5, 8, (9, 6), 11, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 11, 0, 14, (12, 9), 13, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, 6, 9, 13, (4, 12), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <3, 5, 8, 7, (11, 9), 13, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, 7, 11, 0, 14, (12, 9), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 9 chordless 4-cycles, so the final count is [9].
