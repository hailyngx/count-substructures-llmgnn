Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 0, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, 6, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 4, 0, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 3, 7, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 6, 1, 7, 5)
- Cycle 4: (9, 4, 8, 3, 9)
- Cycle 5: (9, 3, 7, 5, 9)
- Cycle 6: (4, 8, 3, 6, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 0, 7, 5, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 3, 8, 9, 4)
- Cycle 9: (8, 4, 2, 1, 8)
- Cycle 10: (6, 1, 2, 7, 6)

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 4: (9, 4, 8, 3, 9), Chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 5: (9, 3, 7, 5, 9), Chord: (9, 5)
- Cycle 7: (4, 0, 7, 5, 4), Chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 8: (4, 3, 8, 9, 4), Chord: (4, 8)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles: 
There are 6 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <9, (4, 8), 3>
- <9, (9, 5), 3>
- <4, (4, 7), 0>
- <4, (4, 8), 9>
