Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0, 7, 8, 6, 0> has a chord (6, 8)
<0, 7, 8, 2, 0> has a chord (2, 8)
<0, 7, 8, 1, 0> has a chord (1, 8)
<1, 7, 8, 6, 1> has a chord (8, 6)
<1, 13, 5, 14, 1> has a chord (5, 14)
<2, 6, 8, 7, 2> has a chord (7, 8)
<3, 1, 8, 6, 3> has a chord (8, 6)
<3, 1, 7, 5, 3> has a chord (7, 5)
<3, 9, 11, 13, 3> has a chord (11, 13)
<4, 12, 13, 9, 4> has a chord (13, 9)
<4, 14, 5, 7, 4> has a chord (5, 7)
<5, 7, 8, 6, 5> has a chord (8, 6)
<9, 3, 10, 12, 9> has a chord (10, 12)
<10, 4, 14, 5, 10> has a chord (14, 5)
<11, 7, 8, 2, 11> has a chord (8, 2)
<12, 4, 14, 5, 12> has a chord (14, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 15 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [15].
