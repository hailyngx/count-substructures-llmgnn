Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, 9, 4, 6> has chord (9, 4).
- <6, 4, 12, 6> has chord (4, 12).
- <6, 4, 10, 6> has chord (4, 10).
- <6, 4, 14, 6> has chord (4, 14).
- <6, 0, 13, 6> has chord (0, 13).
- <9, 11, 12, 9> has chord (11, 12).
- <9, 1, 13, 9> has chord (1, 13).
- <2, 0, 13, 5, 10, 14, 4, 12, 2> has chord (5, 14) or (10, 4).
- <8, 10, 5, 13, 0, 6, 7, 2, 12, 8> has chord (10, 5).
- <8, 7, 13, 5, 10, 4, 12, 11, 6, 9, 1, 8> has chord (13, 5).
- <13, 5, 14, 4, 12, 11, 3, 10, 8, 7, 6, 9, 1, 13> has chord (5, 14) or (10, 4).
- <12, 11, 3, 10, 14, 5, 13, 1, 9, 0, 6, 4, 10, 2, 12> has chord (1, 9).
- <1, 13, 5, 14, 10, 4, 12, 11, 6, 7, 2, 0, 9, 3, 1> has chord (10, 4) or (5, 14).

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found: [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <6, 9, 4, 6>
- <6, 4, 12, 6>
- <6, 4, 10, 6>
- <6, 4, 14, 6>
- <6, 0, 13, 6>
- <9, 11, 12, 9>
- <9, 1, 13, 9>
- <8, 10, 5, 13, 0, 6, 7, 2, 12, 8>
- <8, 7, 13, 5, 10, 4, 12, 11, 6, 9, 1, 8>
