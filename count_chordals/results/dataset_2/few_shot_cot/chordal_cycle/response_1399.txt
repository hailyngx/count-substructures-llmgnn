Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles in the graph, however, we will focus on the cycles with 4 or more nodes:

- Cycle 3: (1, 4, 2, 7)
- Cycle 4: (3, 0, 9, 5)
- Cycle 5: (3, 4, 10, 6)
- Cycle 6: (4, 2, 10, 6)
- Cycle 7: (4, 8, 7, 2)
- Cycle 8: (5, 9, 0, 3)
- Cycle 9: (5, 9, 11, 7)
- Cycle 10: (5, 9, 14, 8)
- Cycle 11: (5, 11, 7, 2)

- Cycle 30: (9, 10, 6, 5)
- Cycle 31: (9, 13, 1, 4)
- Cycle 32: (9, 13, 7, 2)
- Cycle 33: (9, 14, 11, 7)
- Cycle 34: (10, 4, 2, 7)

- Cycle 52: (14, 8, 4, 1)
- Cycle 53: (14, 8, 5, 12)

Step 2:
After examining each cycle, we find only one chordal 4-cycle:  
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (8, 13), 7, 11> 

Step 3:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, so the final count is [1].
