Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 in the graph:

<0, 10, 18, 7>  
<0, 10, 19, 15>  
<0, 12, 1, 5>  
<0, 12, 5, 14>  
<0, 17, 3, 11>  
<0, 17, 3, 13>  
<0, 18, 7, 4>  
<0, 18, 7, 4>  
<0, 18, 13, 4>  
<0, 18, 13, 3>  
<1, 4, 6, 19>  
<1, 4, 7, 18>  
<1, 4, 13, 3>  
<1, 5, 12, 2>  
<1, 5, 14, 14>  
<1, 12, 0, 10>  
<1, 12, 0, 17>  
<1, 12, 2, 12>  
<1, 14, 5, 12>  
<1, 14, 5, 12>  
<2, 12, 0, 10>  
<2, 12, 0, 17>  
<3, 9, 16, 8>  
<3, 9, 16, 8>  
<3, 11, 3, 17>  
<3, 11, 3, 13>  
<3, 17, 0, 10>  
<3, 17, 0, 18>  
<4, 1, 12, 2>  
<4, 1, 5, 14>  
<4, 6, 15, 19>  
<4, 13, 3, 11>  
<5, 1, 12, 2>  
<5, 1, 14, 14>  
<6, 15, 19, 10>  
<6, 19, 10, 18>  
<7, 4, 13, 3>  
<8, 15, 19, 10>  
<8, 16, 9, 3>  
<8, 18, 13, 3>  
<8, 18, 13, 4>  

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

From the listed cycles above, we find that the cycle <0, 17, 3, 11> has exactly one chord: (0, 3)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

Based on the analysis, there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph, so the final count is [1].

<0, 17, 3, 11> with chord (0, 3)
