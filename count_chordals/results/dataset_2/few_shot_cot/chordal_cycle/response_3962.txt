Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 17) (10, 15) (10, 12) (10, 13) (17, 10) (17, 19) (17, 5) (17, 7) (4, 8) (4, 15) (4, 3) (8, 4) (8, 11) (8, 7) (15, 10) (15, 4) (15, 6) (6, 15) (6, 13) (0, 18) (0, 19) (0, 2) (7, 17) (7, 8) (7, 16) (7, 9) (7, 2) (16, 7) (16, 13) (16, 5) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 19) (14, 9) (14, 19) (14, 13) (12, 10) (12, 13) (12, 9) (13, 10) (13, 6) (13, 16) (13, 14) (13, 12) (18, 0) (5, 17) (5, 16) (11, 8) (11, 2) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 11) (19, 17) (19, 0) (19, 3) (19, 14) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 14) (9, 12)

Node 18 is connected to node 0
Node 19 is connected to node 17, 0, 3, and node 14

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 2, 11, 8, 4, 3, 9, 7, 16, 5, 17, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 2, 7, 8, 4, 15, 6, 13, 12, 10, 17, 5, 16, 13, 14, 19, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 2, 11, 8, 4, 3, 9, 7, 16, 5, 17, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19, 0> has one chord: (10, 17)
- The cycle <0, 2, 7, 8, 4, 15, 6, 13, 12, 10, 17, 5, 16, 13, 14, 19, 0> has one chord: (5, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
