Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 8) (8, 7) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 9, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
Possible 4-cycles in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-6-5 
- Cycle 2: 0-1-8-6
- Cycle 3: 0-3-9-6
- Cycle 4: 1-0-5-4
- Cycle 5: 1-8-9-6
- Cycle 6: 2-4-7-5
- Cycle 7: 2-4-9-6
- Cycle 8: 2-6-9-3
- Cycle 9: 3-0-5-7
- Cycle 10: 4-2-6-9
- Cycle 11: 4-5-7-8
- Cycle 12: 5-0-6-9
- Cycle 13: 6-1-8-7
- Cycle 14: 7-4-9-8
- Cycle 15: 8-1-6-9
- Cycle 16: 8-2-9-4
- Cycle 17: 9-3-0-5

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles found by adding exactly one chord:
- <0, (1, 6), 5> with chord 1-6
- <1, (0, 8), 6> with chord 0-8
- <2, (4, 6), 9> with chord 4-6
- <3, (0, 9), 6> with chord 0-9
- <4, (2, 9), 6> with chord 2-9
- <5, (0, 6), 9> with chord 0-6
- <6, (1, 8), 9> with chord 1-8
- <7, (4, 8), 9> with chord 4-8
- <8, (2, 4), 7> with chord 2-4
- <9, (0, 5), 7> with chord 0-5

Step 3:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [10].
