Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (8, 3) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 9
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 3, 8, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 3, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 9, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 9, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 5, 3, 8, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 5, 7, 1, 9, 2, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 5, 7, 3, 8, 5, 0>
- Cycle 6: <2, 6, 9, 1, 7, 3, 5, 2>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 9, 4, 6, 5, 7, 1, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 6, 5, 3, 8, 5, 7, 1, 2>
- Cycle 9: <4, 9, 1, 7, 5, 3, 8, 5, 4>
- Cycle 10: <4, 9, 2, 1, 7, 5, 3, 8, 5, 4>

Step 2:
The chordal cycles among the cycles listed above are:
- Chordal cycle 1: <0, (1, 9), 1, 0>
- Chordal cycle 2: <0, (4, 9), 4, 0>
- Chordal cycle 3: <0, (3, 8), 5, 0>
- Chordal cycle 4: <0, (1, 7), 1, 0>
- Chordal cycle 5: <0, (3, 7), 3, 0>
- Chordal cycle 6: <2, (1, 7), 1, 2>
- Chordal cycle 7: <2, (4, 6), 5, 2>
- Chordal cycle 8: <2, (1, 7), 1, 2>
- Chordal cycle 9: <4, (1, 7), 5, 4>
- Chordal cycle 10: <4, (1, 9), 1, 4>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
