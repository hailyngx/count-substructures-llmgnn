Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 6, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 6, 3, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 2, 6, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 7, 4, 6, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 6, 4, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 5, 9, 7, 2>
- Cycle 8: <4, 5, 9, 7, 4>
- Cycle 9: <4, 6, 1, 3, 8, 4>
- Cycle 10: <4, 7, 0, 9, 5, 4>
- Cycle 11: <6, 4, 7, 9, 5, 6>
- Cycle 12: <6, 7, 2, 5, 9, 6>
- Cycle 13: <7, 4, 0, 9, 8, 7>
- Cycle 14: <7, 9, 5, 2, 6, 7>
- Cycle 15: <8, 3, 6, 4, 8>
- Cycle 16: <9, 5, 2, 7, 4, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 6, 2, 0> has chord (4, 6)
- <0, 4, 6, 3, 8, 4, 0> has chord (4, 8)
- <0, 4, 7, 2, 0> has chord (4, 2)
- <0, 7, 2, 6, 0> has chord (7, 6)
- <0, 7, 4, 6, 0> has chord (7, 4)
- <1, 3, 6, 4, 1> has chord (3, 4)
- <2, 5, 9, 7, 2> has chord (5, 7)
- <4, 5, 9, 7, 4> has chord (5, 7)
- <4, 6, 1, 3, 8, 4> has chord (1, 8)
- <4, 7, 0, 9, 5, 4> has chord (7, 9)
- <6, 4, 7, 9, 5, 6> has chord (4, 9)
- <6, 7, 2, 5, 9, 6> has chord (7, 5)
- <7, 4, 0, 9, 8, 7> has chord (4, 8)
- <7, 9, 5, 2, 6, 7> has chord (5, 6)
- <8, 3, 6, 4, 8> has chord (3, 6)
- <9, 5, 2, 7, 4, 9> has chord (5, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final result is [0].
