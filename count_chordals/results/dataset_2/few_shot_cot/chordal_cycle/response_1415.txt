Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in this graph are as follows:
1. Chordal 4-cycle <0, 4, 13, 1> with chord (1, 13)
2. Chordal 4-cycle <0, 6, 14, 1> with chord (6, 14)
3. Chordal 4-cycle <0, 9, 12, 6> with chord (9, 12)
4. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 7, 3, 14> with chord (7, 14)
5. Chordal 4-cycle <2, 8, 13, 4> with chord (8, 13)
6. Chordal 4-cycle <2, 8, 10, 11> with chord (8, 10)
7. Chordal 4-cycle <4, 11, 10, 0> with chord (4, 10)
8. Chordal 4-cycle <5, 13, 8, 2> with chord (13, 2)
9. Chordal 4-cycle <6, 12, 9, 10> with chord (12, 10)

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
