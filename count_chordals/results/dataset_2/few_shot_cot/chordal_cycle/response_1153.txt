Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are as follows:
1. 0-5-9-6-0
2. 0-5-2-6-0
3. 0-5-1-6-0
4. 0-9-6-7-0
5. 0-9-8-7-0
6. 0-9-8-4-2
7. 0-9-8-3-5
8. 0-6-2-4-8
9. 0-6-2-5-1
10. 0-8-9-5-3
11. 0-8-4-2-6
12. 0-8-3-5-9
13. 1-5-9-8-4
14. 1-6-2-4-8
15. 1-6-2-0-5
16. 2-5-9-8-4
17. 2-6-1-5-3
18. 3-5-9-8-4
19. 6-9-5-3-7
20. 8-9-5-3-7

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chord at (9, 5) in cycle 2
- Chord at (9, 8) in cycle 4
- Chord at (8, 4) in cycle 6
- Chord at (8, 3) in cycle 8
- Chord at (5, 1) in cycle 10
- Chord at (3, 7) in cycle 19
- Chord at (5, 3) in cycle 20

Step 3:
There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, which are:
<0, 5, 2, 6, 0>
<0, 9, 6, 7, 0>
<0, 9, 8, 7, 0>
<0, 9, 8, 4, 2>
<0, 9, 8, 3, 5>
<1, 5, 9, 8, 4>
<6, 9, 5, 3, 7>

Therefore, the final count is [7].
