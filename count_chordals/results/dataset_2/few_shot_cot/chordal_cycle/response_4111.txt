Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 1, 7, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 5, 14, 4, 11, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 5, 14, 4, 2, 13, 7, 1>
- Cycle 4: <10, 6, 12, 9, 4, 11, 10>
- Cycle 5: <10, 6, 12, 14, 4, 11, 10>
- Cycle 6: <11, 0, 3, 5, 14, 4, 2, 13, 11>
- Cycle 7: <11, 0, 7, 13, 2, 4, 11>
- Cycle 8: <11, 4, 2, 13, 7, 0, 11>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal Cycle 1: <0, 3, 1, 7, 0> (Chord: 1-7)
- Chordal Cycle 2: <0, 3, 5, 14, 4, 11, 0> (Chord: 4-11)
- Chordal Cycle 3: <1, 3, 5, 14, 4, 2, 13, 7, 1> (Chord: 4-13)
- Chordal Cycle 4: <10, 6, 12, 9, 4, 11, 10> (Chord: 9-11)
- Chordal Cycle 5: <10, 6, 12, 14, 4, 11, 10> (Chord: 6-12)
- Chordal Cycle 6: <11, 0, 3, 5, 14, 4, 2, 13, 11> (Chord: 3-14)
- Chordal Cycle 7: <11, 0, 7, 13, 2, 4, 11> (Chord: 7-13)
- Chordal Cycle 8: <11, 4, 2, 13, 7, 0, 11> (Chord: 2-7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are [8] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
