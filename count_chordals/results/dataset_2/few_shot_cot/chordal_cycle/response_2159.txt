Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 2) (3, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 9, 3>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 2, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 5, 7>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 1, 2>
- Cycle 5: <2, 1, 8, 6>
- Cycle 6: <2, 3, 5, 6>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 8, 4>
- Cycle 8: <4, 6, 8, 2>
- Cycle 9: <4, 6, 8, 7>
- Cycle 10: <4, 9, 3, 5>
- Cycle 11: <5, 3, 2, 6>
- Cycle 12: <5, 6, 8, 7>
- Cycle 13: <7, 0, 4, 9>
- Cycle 14: <7, 0, 3, 5>
- Cycle 15: <7, 1, 2, 6>
- Cycle 16: <7, 1, 8, 4>

Step 2: Checking for one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has a chord <3, 5>.
- Cycle 4 has a chord <0, 1>.
- Cycle 5 has a chord <1, 6>.
- Cycle 6 has a chord <3, 6>.
- Cycle 7 has a chord <2, 8>.
- Cycle 8 has a chord <6, 2>.
- Cycle 9 has a chord <6, 8>.
- Cycle 10 has no chord.
- Cycle 11 has a chord <2, 6>.
- Cycle 12 has a chord <3, 8>.
- Cycle 13 has no chord.
- Cycle 14 has a chord <0, 7>.
- Cycle 15 has a chord <1, 6>.
- Cycle 16 has no chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
