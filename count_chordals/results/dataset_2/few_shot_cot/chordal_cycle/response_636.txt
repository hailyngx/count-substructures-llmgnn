Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph are:
<0, 4, 9, 11> 
<0, 6, 14, 13>
<2, 5, 4, 9>
<2, 5, 11, 10>
<2, 8, 12, 16>
<5, 11, 19, 7>
<6, 12, 8, 16>
<9, 11, 5, 2>
<9, 7, 19, 11>
<16, 15, 17, 13>

Among these, only the following chordal 4-cycles have exactly one chord:
<0, 4, 9, 11> with the chord (4, 11)
<0, 6, 14, 13> with the chord (6, 13)
<2, 8, 12, 16> with the chord (8, 12)
<9, 11, 5, 2> with the chord (11, 5)

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
