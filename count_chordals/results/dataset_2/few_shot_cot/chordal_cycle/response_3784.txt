Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of all cycles of length 4 or more: 
- <0, 5, 1, 9, 0> 
- <0, 5, 9, 2, 1, 0> 
- <0, 5, 9, 4, 2, 1, 0> 
- <0, 9, 3, 7, 5, 0> 
- <0, 9, 4, 2, 8, 3, 0> 
- <0, 9, 4, 8, 3, 0> 
- <0, 9, 5, 6, 8, 3, 0> 
- <1, 5, 6, 8, 2, 9, 1> 
- <2, 9, 4, 8, 6, 5, 2> 
- <3, 9, 5, 7, 3> 

Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 5, 1, 9, 0> has 1 chord: (1, 9)
- <0, 5, 9, 2, 1, 0> has 1 chord: (2, 5) 
- <0, 5, 9, 4, 2, 1, 0> is chordless 
- <0, 9, 3, 7, 5, 0> has 1 chord: (3, 7) 
- <0, 9, 4, 2, 8, 3, 0> has 1 chord: (4, 8) 
- <0, 9, 4, 8, 3, 0> is chordless 
- <0, 9, 5, 6, 8, 3, 0> has 1 chord: (6, 8) 
- <1, 5, 6, 8, 2, 9, 1> has 1 chord: (6, 8)
- <2, 9, 4, 8, 6, 5, 2> is chordless 
- <3, 9, 5, 7, 3> is chordless 

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [4]

The unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 5, 9, 4, 2, 1, 0>
