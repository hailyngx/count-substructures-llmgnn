Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 14>
        - Cycle 2: <0, 4, 13, 1>
        - Cycle 3: <0, 4, 6, 19>
        - Cycle 4: <0, 7, 15, 2>
        - Cycle 5: <2, 5, 18, 17>
        - Cycle 6: <2, 15, 7, 0>
        - Cycle 7: <3, 8, 4, 13>
        - Cycle 8: <3, 6, 19, 14>
        - Cycle 9: <5, 2, 18, 17>
        - Cycle 10: <6, 4, 8, 3>
        - Cycle 11: <6, 4, 13, 1>
        - Cycle 12: <6, 12, 17, 18>
        - Cycle 13: <6, 19, 14, 8>
        - Cycle 14: <7, 0, 4, 13>
        - Cycle 15: <8, 4, 13, 1>
        - Cycle 16: <8, 14, 19, 10>
        - Cycle 17: <9, 1, 13, 4>
        - Cycle 18: <12, 11, 16, 17>
        - Cycle 19: <16, 11, 13, 1>
        - Cycle 20: <16, 12, 6, 4>
        - Cycle 21: <17, 18, 2, 5>
        - Cycle 22: <18, 5, 2, 15>
        - Cycle 23: <18, 17, 16, 11>
        - Cycle 24: <19, 14, 8, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <0, 4, 8, 14> has a chord: (8, 14)
        - <0, 4, 6, 19> has a chord: (4, 19)
        - <2, 5, 18, 17> has a chord: (5, 17)
        - <3, 8, 4, 13> has a chord: (4, 13)
        - <3, 6, 19, 14> has a chord: (6, 14)
        - <6, 12, 17, 18> has a chord: (12, 18)
        - <8, 14, 19, 10> has a chord: (14, 10)
        - <12, 11, 16, 17> has a chord: (11, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [17]
