Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 4, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 3, 9>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 9, 3>
- Cycle 5: <0, 8, 3, 9>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 9, 4>
- Cycle 7: <1, 7, 5, 6>
- Cycle 8: <1, 5, 6, 8>
- Cycle 9: <1, 6, 5, 8>
- Cycle 10: <2, 9, 4, 3>
- Cycle 11: <2, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 12: <2, 7, 5, 6>
- Cycle 13: <2, 7, 1, 6>
- Cycle 14: <2, 7, 5, 8>
- Cycle 15: <2, 5, 6, 8>
- Cycle 16: <3, 9, 4, 8>
- Cycle 17: <3, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 18: <3, 4, 0, 6>
- Cycle 19: <4, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 20: <4, 9, 3, 8>
- Cycle 21: <4, 3, 8, 5>
- Cycle 22: <5, 6, 8, 2>
- Cycle 23: <5, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 24: <5, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle 25: <5, 8, 3, 9>
- Cycle 26: <6, 1, 7, 9>
- Cycle 27: <6, 1, 5, 8>
- Cycle 28: <6, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle 29: <8, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 30: <8, 6, 5, 2>
- Cycle 31: <8, 4, 0, 5>
- Cycle 32: <9, 4, 3, 8>
- Cycle 33: <9, 3, 8, 6>
- Cycle 34: <9, 7, 5, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 3, 9> has a chord: (4, 3)
- <0, 4, 8, 6> has a chord: (4, 8)
- <1, 7, 5, 6> has a chord: (7, 5)
- <1, 6, 5, 8> has a chord: (6, 5)
- <2, 9, 4, 3> has a chord: (9, 3)
- <2, 7, 5, 8> has a chord: (7, 8)
- <3, 4, 8, 6> has a chord: (4, 6)
- <4, 9, 7, 1> has a chord: (9, 1)
- <5, 8, 4, 0> has a chord: (8, 4)
- <8, 6, 5, 2> has a chord: (6, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [24]
