Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <2, (18, 10), 24, 27)>.

Here is the step-by-step process of counting the chordal 4-cycles:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (1, 2, 26, 4)
- Cycle 2: (1, 2, 18, 25)
- Cycle 3: (1, 2, 16, 23)
- Cycle 4: (1, 26, 4, 17)
- Cycle 5: (1, 26, 24, 7)
- Cycle 6: (1, 26, 24, 27)
- Cycle 7: (1, 2, 18, 20)
- Cycle 8: (2, 18, 25, 5)
- Cycle 9: (2, 18, 20, 27)
- Cycle 10: (18, 25, 5, 29)
- Cycle 11: (18, 25, 12, 22)
- Cycle 12: (18, 20, 3, 25)
- Cycle 13: (18, 20, 21, 27)
- Cycle 14: (18, 5, 29, 19)
- Cycle 15: (26, 4, 17, 29)
- Cycle 16: (26, 4, 17, 28)
- Cycle 17: (26, 24, 7, 29)
- Cycle 18: (26, 24, 10, 19)
- Cycle 19: (26, 2, 18, 5)
- Cycle 20: (26, 2, 16, 23)
- Cycle 21: (24, 7, 29, 19)
- Cycle 22: (24, 7, 29, 5)
- Cycle 23: (24, 26, 4, 17)
- Cycle 24: (24, 26, 4, 17)
- Cycle 25: (24, 26, 1, 2)
- Cycle 26: (24, 26, 1, 14)
- Cycle 27: (27, 21, 20, 3)
- Cycle 28: (27, 21, 20, 18)
- Cycle 29: (27, 20, 18, 25)
- Cycle 30: (27, 20, 18, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <2, (18, 10), 24, 27)>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
The number of chordless cycles found is [30 - 1 = 29].
