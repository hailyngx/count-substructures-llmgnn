Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 6) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 8, 4, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, 6, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 2, 0, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 8, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 9, 2, 6, 8, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 5, 9, 2, 6, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 3, 9, 4, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 5, 8, 7, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 9, 4, 3, 7, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 9, 5, 8, 0, 6, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 9, 5, 0, 8, 7, 1, 9>
- Cycle 10: <3, 5, 9, 4, 3>
- Cycle 11: <4, 9, 5, 8, 0, 6, 2, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 9, 2, 6, 0, 8, 7, 4>
- Cycle 13: <5, 9, 2, 6, 0, 8, 5>
- Cycle 14: <5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 1, 9, 5>
- Cycle 15: <1, 9, 3, 7, 8, 5, 0, 6, 2, 4, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 9, 2, 6, 8, 0> has a chord (5, 8)
- <0, 3, 5, 9, 2, 6, 0> has a chord (3, 6)
- <2, 9, 5, 0, 8, 7, 1, 9> has a chord (5, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 12 chordless cycles identified.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [12].
