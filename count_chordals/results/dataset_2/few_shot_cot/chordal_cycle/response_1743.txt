Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (0, 4, 8, 1, 0)
- (0, 4, 12, 3, 0)
- (0, 5, 10, 14, 0)
- (1, 8, 4, 0, 1)
- (1, 8, 12, 3, 1)
- (1, 13, 7, 3, 1)
- (2, 11, 13, 1, 2)
- (2, 7, 13, 3, 2)
- (3, 12, 8, 1, 3)
- (3, 12, 4, 0, 3)
- (4, 8, 12, 3, 4)
- (7, 9, 4, 0, 7)
- (7, 9, 13, 3, 7)
- (8, 12, 4, 0, 8)
- (9, 4, 12, 3, 9)
  
Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <1, (8, 12), 3, 1>: Chord (8, 12) is present.
- <1, (13, 7), 3, 1>: Chord (13, 7) is present.
- <2, 11, 13, (1, 2)>: Chord (1, 2) is present.
- <3, 12, (8, 1), 3>: Chord (8, 1) is present.
- <3, (12, 4), 0, 3>: Chord (12, 4) is present.
- <4, (8, 12), 3, 4>: Chord (8, 12) is present.
- <7, (9, 4), 0, 7>: Chord (9, 4) is present.
- <7, 9, (13, 3), 7>: Chord (13, 3) is present.
- <8, 12, (4, 0), 8>: Chord (4, 0) is present.
- <9, 4, 12, (3, 9)>: Chord (3, 9) is present.
  
Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: [10]
