Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 27, 26, 8, 7, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 17, 23, 7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 1, 18, 2)
- Cycle 4: (3, 13, 23, 17, 3)
- Cycle 5: (4, 20, 24, 19, 4)
- Cycle 6: (5, 9, 18, 5)
- Cycle 7: (6, 0, 27, 21, 6)
- Cycle 8: (8, 26, 27, 16, 8)
- Cycle 9: (10, 11, 21, 27, 16, 10)
- Cycle 10: (12, 23, 17, 19, 12)
- Cycle 11: (14, 0, 27, 21, 25, 14)
- Cycle 12: (15, 22, 2, 18, 14, 25, 15)
- Cycle 13: (16, 27, 21, 25, 16)
- Cycle 14: (18, 5, 9, 18)

- Cycle 17: (21, 27, 26, 8, 22, 21)
- Cycle 18: (23, 13, 3, 17, 23)
- Cycle 19: (24, 19, 28, 25, 24)
- Cycle 20: (25, 14, 0, 27, 26, 25)
- Cycle 21: (26, 27, 0, 6, 21, 26)
- Cycle 22: (27, 21, 25, 28, 27)
- Cycle 23: (28, 13, 3, 17, 1, 18, 14, 25, 28)
- Cycle 24: (29, 28, 13, 23, 17, 1, 18, 5, 9, 29)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (5, 9), 18, (14, 25)>
- <2, (1, 18), 22>
- <3, (13, 23), 17>
- <4, (20, 24), 19>
- <6, (0, 27), 21>
- <8, (26, 27), 16>
- <10, (11, 21), 27>
- <12, (23, 17), 19>
- <13, (3, 19), 28>
- <15, (22, 2), 14>
- <16, (27, 21), 25>
- <18, (9, 5), 14>
- <19, (28, 13), 3>
- <20, (4, 20), 24>
- <21, (27, 26), 8>
- <23, (23, 13), 17>
- <24, (19, 28), 25>
- <25, (14, 0), 27>
- <26, (26, 27), 0>
- <27, (21, 27), 16>
- <28, (13, 3), 17>
- <29, (28, 13), 23>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 19 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [19].
