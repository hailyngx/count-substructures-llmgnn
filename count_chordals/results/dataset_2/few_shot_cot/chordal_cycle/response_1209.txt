Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <1, 3, 4, 7>
- <11, 15, 4, 7>
- <1, 3, 4, 15>
- <1, 17, 7, 4>
- <9, 10, 15, 11>
- <10, 15, 4, 7>
- <1, 17, 13, 0>
- <1, 8, 3, 4>
- <1, 17, 7, 6>
- <1, 2, 19, 11>
- <1, 2, 11, 14>
- <1, 8, 12, 16>
- <9, 12, 16, 10>
- <9, 16, 12, 8>
- <6, 2, 19, 11>
- <6, 7, 4, 15>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 3, 4, 7> has one chord: (3, 7)
- <11, 15, 4, 7> has one chord: (15, 7)
- <1, 3, 4, 15> has one chord: (3, 15)
- <1, 17, 7, 4> has one chord: (17, 4)
- <9, 10, 15, 11> has one chord: (10, 11)
- <10, 15, 4, 7> has one chord: (15, 7)
- <1, 17, 13, 0> has one chord: (17, 0)
- <1, 8, 3, 4> is chordal
- <1, 17, 7, 6> has one chord: (17, 6)
- <1, 2, 19, 11> has one chord: (2, 11)
- <1, 2, 11, 14> is chordal
- <1, 8, 12, 16> is chordal
- <9, 12, 16, 10> is chordal
- <9, 16, 12, 8> is chordal
- <6, 2, 19, 11> has one chord: (2, 19)
- <6, 7, 4, 15> has one chord: (7, 15)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found:
- There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [5].
