Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <0, 16, 4, 7> has a chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 2: <0, 16, 27, 29> has a chord (16, 27)
- Cycle 5: <1, 24, 4, 7> has a chord (4, 24)
- Cycle 8: <3, 6, 14, 7> has a chord (6, 14)
- Cycle 9: <3, 6, 14, 13> has a chord (6, 14)
- Cycle 10: <4, 16, 27, 11> has a chord (16, 27)
- Cycle 11: <4, 7, 22, 26> has a chord (7, 22)
- Cycle 13: <5, 21, 9, 12> has a chord (9, 21)
- Cycle 19: <9, 21, 14, 23> has a chord (14, 23)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 30 cycles in total, and 8 of them have exactly one chord.
So, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [22].
