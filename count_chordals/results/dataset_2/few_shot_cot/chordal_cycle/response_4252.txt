- <19, 1, 4, 18>
- <19, 1, 16, 8>
- <19, 5, 15, 17>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, 4, 18, 3> (Chord: (1, 18))
- <1, 4, 15, 5> (Chord: (4, 15))
- <1, 16, 8, 10> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <1, 16, 8, 16> (Chord: (16, 1))
- <2, 12, 17, 15> (Chord: (12, 17))
- <5, 15, 17, 12> (Chord: (15, 17))
- <6, 9, 7, 10> (Chord: (7, 9))
- <8, 10, 2, 12> (Chord: (10, 2))
- <7, 10, 13, 11> (Chord: (10, 13))
- <7, 14, 16, 8> (Chord: (14, 16))
- <13, 16, 8, 10> (Chord: (16, 8))
- <15, 17, 12, 2> (Chord: (17, 12))
- <18, 9, 11, 6> (Chord: (9, 11))
- <19, 1, 4, 18> (Chord: (1, 4))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found = 14
Therefore, the final number is [14].
