Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 15, 3, 10, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 16, 6, 14, 4>
- Cycle 3: <0, 16, 4, 17, 15>
- Cycle 4: <1, 8, 5, 12, 3>
- Cycle 5: <1, 8, 18, 11, 15>
- Cycle 6: <1, 8, 18, 10, 7>
- Cycle 7: <1, 13, 4, 17, 15>
- Cycle 8: <2, 7, 10, 3, 15>
- Cycle 9: <4, 13, 1, 8, 5>
- Cycle 10: <4, 13, 18, 11, 15>
- Cycle 11: <4, 13, 18, 10, 7>
- Cycle 12: <4, 17, 15, 11, 6>
- Cycle 13: <4, 17, 15, 3, 10>
- Cycle 14: <5, 12, 3, 15, 11>
- Cycle 15: <6, 14, 9, 11, 18>
- Cycle 16: <6, 14, 9, 11, 15>
- Cycle 17: <7, 10, 3, 15, 11>
- Cycle 18: <11, 15, 17, 4, 13>
- Cycle 19: <11, 15, 3, 12, 5>
- Cycle 20: <11, 18, 10, 7, 2>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for a chord:

From the cycles listed above, we find that the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 16, 6, 14, 4> with a chord connecting 16 and 14

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 20 cycles found, and [1] of them is a chordal 4-cycle.

Therefore, the final result is [1].
