Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <1, 9, 5, 4, 1> (of length 4)
- Cycle 2: <1, 9, 6, 4, 1> (of length 4)
- Cycle 3: <1, 9, 6, 8, 4, 1> (of length 5)
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 5, 8, 4, 1> (of length 5)
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 4, 5, 1> (of length 4)
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 8, 4, 5, 1> (of length 5)
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 8, 5, 9, 1> (of length 5)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1: <1, 9, 5, 4, 1> has the chord (9, 4)
- Cycle 2: <1, 9, 6, 4, 1> has the chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 3: <1, 9, 6, 8, 4, 1> has the chord (9, 8)
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 5, 8, 4, 1> has the chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 4, 5, 1> has the chord (6, 5)
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 8, 4, 5, 1> has the chord (6, 8)
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 8, 5, 9, 1> has the chord (3, 5)
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0] (No chordless cycles found)
  
Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, 9, 5, 4, 1> with the chord (9, 4).
