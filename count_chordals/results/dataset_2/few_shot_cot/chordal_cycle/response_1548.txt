Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 9, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 7, 3, 4, 1>
- Cycle 4: <3, 4, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 5: <4, 5, 8, 6, 4>
- Cycle 6: <5, 7, 3, 6, 5>
- Cycle 7: <5, 9, 2, 4, 5>
- Cycle 8: <5, 8, 4, 3, 5>
- Cycle 9: <7, 5, 9, 2, 7>
- Cycle 10: <8, 5, 9, 2, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 9, 2, 0> has a chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 7, 1, 0> has a chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 3: <1, 7, 3, 4, 1> has a chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 4: <3, 4, 5, 8, 3> has a chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 5: <4, 5, 8, 6, 4> has a chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 6: <5, 7, 3, 6, 5> has a chord (7, 3)
- Cycle 7: <5, 9, 2, 4, 5> has a chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 8: <5, 8, 4, 3, 5> has a chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 9: <7, 5, 9, 2, 7> has a chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 10: <8, 5, 9, 2, 8> has a chord (5, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: 
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final number is [10].
