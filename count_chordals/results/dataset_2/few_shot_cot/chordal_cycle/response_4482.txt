Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: 
- Cycle <3, 15, 5, 21> with chord (5,15)
- Cycle <3, 15, 16, 5> with chord (3,16)
- Cycle <3, 24, 25, 14> with chord (14,25)
- Cycle <15, 5, 21, 13> with chord (15,13)
- Cycle <0, 16, 5, 15> with chord (0,5)
- Cycle <0, 16, 27, 22> with chord (0,27)
- Cycle <0, 11, 23, 19> with chord (0,23)
- Cycle <27, 16, 12, 6> with chord (16,6)
- Cycle <1, 7, 14, 25> with chord (1,14)
- Cycle <1, 27, 16, 0> with chord (1,0)
- Cycle <2, 8, 18, 4> with chord (8,4)
- Cycle <2, 10, 22, 0> with chord (10,0)
- Cycle <4, 26, 19, 23> with chord (26,23)
- Cycle <17, 27, 16, 0> with chord (17,0)
- Cycle <9, 19, 26, 11> with chord (19,11)
- Cycle <21, 13, 29, 6> with chord (13,6)

Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycles: <3, 15, 16, 5> (3,16), <0, 16, 27, 22> (0,27), <2, 8, 18, 4> (8,4), <4, 26, 19, 23> (26,23)

Step 3:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]
