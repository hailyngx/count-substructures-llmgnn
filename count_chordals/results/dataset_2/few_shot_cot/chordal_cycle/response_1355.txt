Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (3, 0) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2: 
- There are no chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Step 3: 
- Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles found in the graph is [0].
