Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (5, 4) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 5) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 0, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 6, 2>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 7, 5>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 5, 3>
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 4, 5>
- Cycle 6: <1, 0, 4, 9>
- Cycle 7: <1, 0, 9, 3>
- Cycle 8: <1, 2, 6, 8>
- Cycle 9: <1, 2, 5, 4>
- Cycle 10: <1, 2, 9, 3>
- Cycle 11: <1, 3, 4, 9>
- Cycle 12: <1, 7, 5, 3>
- Cycle 13: <2, 6, 1, 9>
- Cycle 14: <2, 6, 8, 3>
- Cycle 15: <2, 9, 4, 5>
- Cycle 16: <3, 5, 4, 9>
- Cycle 17: <4, 9, 3, 8>

Step 2: Check for cycles with one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <1, 6>, making it a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 1, 6, 2>
- Cycle 2 has a chord <1, 7>, making it a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 1, 7, 5>
- Cycle 3 has a chord <0, 9>, making it a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle 4 has a chord <0, 4>, making it a chordal 4-cycle: <0, 4, 5, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are <0, 1, 6, 2>, <0, 1, 7, 5>, <0, 4, 9, 1>, and <0, 4, 5, 3>.
