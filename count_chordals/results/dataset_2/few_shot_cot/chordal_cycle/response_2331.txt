Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 8, 7, 10, 4, 3, 12, 0)
- Cycle 3: (1, 2, 7, 10, 4, 3, 13, 9, 8, 11, 17, 12, 16, 15, 10, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 1, 10, 4, 3, 12, 0, 8, 9, 13, 3, 4, 2)
- Cycle 5: (3, 12, 17, 19, 11, 8, 9, 13, 3)
- Cycle 6: (4, 3, 12, 17, 11, 8, 9, 13, 3, 4)
- Cycle 7: (6, 7, 2, 1, 10, 4, 3, 12, 0, 5, 6)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: No chords
- Cycle 2: Chord (0, 12)
- Cycle 3: Chord (2, 9)
- Cycle 4: Chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 5: Chord (12, 9)
- Cycle 6: Chord (3, 12)
- Cycle 7: Chord (1, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
- <0, 5, 12, 8> 
- <0, 12, 17, 11>
