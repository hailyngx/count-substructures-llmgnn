Response:
Step 1: 
We can identify the cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 13, 4, 2> 
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 13, 18, 10> 
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 19, 14, 6> 
- Cycle 4: <0, 8, 15, 12, 16> 
- Cycle 5: <1, 13, 18, 10, 3> 
- Cycle 6: <2, 5, 11, 3, 7>
- Cycle 7: <2, 7, 19, 14, 6> 
- Cycle 8: <3, 11, 5, 8, 15>
- Cycle 9: <3, 10, 18, 13, 1>
- Cycle 10: <4, 13, 18, 10, 2>
- Cycle 11: <5, 8, 0, 7, 3>
- Cycle 12: <5, 15, 12, 16, 6> 
- Cycle 13: <9, 17, 19, 10, 3> 
- Cycle 14: <11, 5, 8, 15, 12> 
- Cycle 15: <14, 19, 10, 18, 13> 
- Cycle 16: <16, 12, 15, 8, 5> 
- Cycle 17: <17, 9, 16, 12, 15> 

Step 2: 
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycles: 
- Unique chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 11, 3, 7> with chord (5, 7) 
- Unique chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 1, 13, 18> with chord (1, 18) 
- Unique chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 7, 19, 14> with chord (7, 19) 
- Unique chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 8, 15, 12> with chord (8, 15) 
- Unique chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, 13, 18, 10> with chord (13, 10) 
- Unique chordal 4-cycle 6: <2, 7, 19, 14> with chord (7, 19) 
- Unique chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, 10, 18, 13> with chord (10, 18) 
- Unique chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, 8, 15, 12> with chord (8, 15) 

Step 3: 
There are a total of 8 unique chordal 4-cycles as listed above, so the final count is [8].
