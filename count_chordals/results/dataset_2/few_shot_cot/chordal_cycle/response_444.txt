Response:
Following the steps outlined, let's find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 27, 29, 26>
- Cycle 2: <4, 7, 5, 6>
- Cycle 3: <4, 13, 20, 18>
- Cycle 4: <4, 15, 17, 0>
- Cycle 5: <5, 14, 11, 3>
- Cycle 6: <9, 29, 26, 12>
- Cycle 7: <11, 17, 15, 4>
- Cycle 8: <18, 20, 13, 4>
- Cycle 9: <18, 25, 19, 16>
- Cycle 10: <18, 25, 6, 5>
- Cycle 11: <19, 21, 24, 19>
- Cycle 12: <22, 26, 29, 27>
- Cycle 13: <23, 19, 16, 4>
- Cycle 14: <25, 18, 12, 26>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

- From Cycle 1, <0, 27, 29, 26>, the chord is (27, 26)
- From Cycle 3, <4, 13, 20, 18>, the chord is (13, 20)
- From Cycle 4, <4, 15, 17, 0>, the chord is (15, 17)
- From Cycle 8, <18, 20, 13, 4>, the chord is (13, 20)
- From Cycle 9, <18, 25, 19, 16>, the chord is (19, 16)
- From Cycle 10, <18, 25, 6, 5>, the chord is (6, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found:

The number of chordal 4-cycles is counted as [5].
