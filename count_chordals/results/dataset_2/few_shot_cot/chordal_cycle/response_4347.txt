Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
1. <0, 5, 1, 9> (Chord: (0, 1))
2. <0, 5, 1, 14> (Chord: (1, 5))
3. <0, 4, 8, 6> (Chord: (4, 8))
4. <0, 4, 3, 12> (Chord: (3, 12))
5. <0, 4, 10, 12> (Chord: (4, 10))
6. <1, 5, 3, 11> (Chord: (3, 11))
7. <1, 5, 3, 6> (Chord: (3, 6))
8. <1, 8, 13, 9> (Chord: (9, 13))
9. <2, 6, 3, 12> (Chord: (3, 12))
10. <2, 6, 3, 14> (Chord: (3, 14))
11. <4, 8, 1, 10> (Chord: (1, 10))
12. <6, 8, 1, 14> (Chord: (8, 14))

In this graph, there are a total of [12] unique chordal 4-cycles.
