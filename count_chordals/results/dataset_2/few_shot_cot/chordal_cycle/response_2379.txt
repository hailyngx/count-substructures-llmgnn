Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle <0, 1, 8, 9> with chord (0, 8)
- Cycle <0, 3, 11, 5> with chord (0, 11)
- Cycle <1, 7, 12, 8> with chord (1, 12)
- Cycle <2, 4, 9, 6> with chord (2, 9)
- Cycle <2, 7, 12, 6> with chord (2, 12)
- Cycle <3, 4, 9, 6> with chord (3, 9)
- Cycle <3, 4, 14, 6> with chord (3, 14)
- Cycle <5, 7, 12, 6> with chord (5, 12)
- Cycle <0, 4, 9, 6> with chord (0, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Among the listed cycles, <0, 1, 8, 9>, <0, 3, 11, 5>, <1, 7, 12, 8>, <2, 4, 9, 6>, <2, 7, 12, 6>, <3, 4, 9, 6>, <3, 4, 14, 6>, <5, 7, 12, 6>, and <0, 4, 9, 6> have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- From the above list, there are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles. Therefore, the final count is [9].
