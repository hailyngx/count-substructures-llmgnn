Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - (0, 15, 0)
        - (0, 19, 0)
        - (0, 13, 0)
        - (1, 2, 1)
        - (1, 18, 1)
        - (1, 13, 1)
        - (2, 18, 2)
        - (2, 5, 2)
        - (2, 6, 2)
        - (3, 14, 3)
        - (3, 16, 3)
        - (3, 5, 3)
        - (3, 12, 3)
        - (4, 13, 4)
        - (4, 6, 4)
        - (5, 11, 5)
        - (5, 18, 5)
        - (6, 2, 6)
        - (6, 16, 6)
        - (6, 4, 6)
        - (7, 14, 7)
        - (7, 10, 7)
        - (7, 11, 7)
        - (10, 11, 10)
        - (10, 12, 10)
        - (11, 19, 11)
        - (11, 9, 11)
        - (12, 10, 12)
        - (12, 3, 12)
        - (12, 13, 12)
        - (13, 0, 13)
        - (13, 1, 13)
        - (13, 4, 13)
        - (13, 6, 13)
        - (14, 17, 14)
        - (14, 3, 14)
        - (16, 17, 16)
        - (16, 3, 16)
        - (16, 6, 16)
        - (17, 14, 17)
        - (17, 16, 17)
        - (19, 17, 19)
        - (19, 11, 19)
        - (19, 0, 19)
        - (19, 8, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <1, (2, 18), 5>
        - <1, (13, 4), 6>
        - <2, (18, 5), 6>
        - <3, (14, 7), 10>
        - <3, (16, 6), 4>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. Since we have found 5 unique chordal 4-cycles, the final count is [5].
