Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 6, 7, 19> (chordless)
- <0, 6, 9, 15> (chordless)
- <0, 6, 8, 11> (chordless)
- <0, 5, 13, 10> (chordless)
- <0, 5, 15, 9> (chordless)
- <0, 5, 13, 14> (chordless)
- <1, 11, 3, 15> (chordless)
- <1, 11, 8, 6> (chordless)
- <1, 11, 18, 3> (chordless)
- <1, 17, 0, 6> (chordless)
- <1, 17, 0, 5> (chordless)
- <1, 17, 1, 11> (chordless)
- <1, 18, 3, 15> (chordless)
- <1, 18, 11, 8> (chordless)
- <1, 18, 11, 3> (chordless)
- <2, 4, 19, 7> (chordless)
- <2, 4, 19, 7> (chordless)
- <2, 4, 14, 13> (chordless)
- <2, 4, 14, 13> (chordless)
- <2, 7, 6, 9> (chordless)
- <2, 7, 6, 8> (chordless)
- <2, 7, 19, 4> (chordless)
- <2, 7, 16, 12> (chordless)
- <2, 7, 16, 7> (chordless)
- <2, 7, 16, 12> (chordless)
- <2, 7, 19, 4> (chordless)
- <2, 10, 13, 14> (chordless)
- <2, 10, 13, 14> (chordless)
- <3, 15, 9, 6> (chordless)
- <3, 15, 9, 6> (chordless)
- <3, 15, 13, 5> (chordless)
- <3, 15, 13, 5> (chordless)
- <3, 15, 13, 14> (chordless)
- <3, 15, 13, 14> (chordless)
- <3, 18, 11, 8> (chordless)

- <4, 19, 7, 6> (chordless)
- <4, 19, 7, 6> (chordless)
- <5, 13, 10, 2> (chordless)
- <5, 13, 10, 2> (chordless)
- <5, 15, 9, 6> (chordless)
- <5, 15, 9, 6> (chordless)
- <5, 15, 13, 10> (chordless)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- There are no cycles with exactly one chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 44 chordless cycles.

Final result: [44]
