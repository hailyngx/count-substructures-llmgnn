Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 3, 4, 10> has a chord (3, 10)
- <0, 3, 18, 10> has a chord (3, 18)
- <1, 9, 16, 10> has a chord (9, 10)
- <2, 9, 14, 10> has a chord (9, 14)
- <2, 15, 7, 5> has a chord (7, 15)
- <2, 15, 7, 6> has a chord (7, 15)
- <2, 17, 11, 13> has a chord (11, 13)
- <3, 4, 10, 16> has a chord (4, 16)
- <3, 14, 9, 16> has a chord (14, 16)
- <4, 10, 16, 9> has a chord (10, 9)
- <5, 6, 7, 0> has a chord (6, 7)
- <5, 6, 8, 19> has a chord (6, 8)
- <5, 19, 1, 9> has a chord (1, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [46]
