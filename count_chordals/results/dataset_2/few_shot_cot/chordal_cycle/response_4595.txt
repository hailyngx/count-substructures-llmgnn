Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph can be listed as follows:

Step 1:
- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 12, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 14, 2, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 5, 13, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 12, 6, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 12, 10, 13, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 12, 10, 11, 6, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 12, 10, 13, 5, 0>
- Cycle 8: <1, 4, 12, 10, 11, 6, 1>
- Cycle 9: <2, 6, 0, 14, 2>
- Cycle 10: <3, 8, 5, 7, 3>
- Cycle 11: <4, 12, 10, 11, 6, 4>
- Cycle 12: <5, 7, 6, 2, 5>
- Cycle 13: <6, 7, 5, 4, 6>
- Cycle 14: <7, 10, 12, 6, 7>
- Cycle 15: <8, 3, 2, 14, 8>
- Cycle 16: <9, 1, 4, 12, 9>
- Cycle 17: <10, 12, 14, 2, 10>
- Cycle 18: <11, 10, 13, 2, 11>
- Cycle 19: <13, 5, 7, 10, 13>
  
Step 2:
- Only Cycle 14: <7, 10, 12, 6, 7> has exactly one chord: (10, 6).
  
Step 3:
- Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
