Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (11, 16) (16, 11) (16, 0) (16, 3) (14, 17) (14, 3) (14, 15) (14, 2) (14, 13) (17, 14) (17, 6) (8, 13) (8, 7) (8, 12) (13, 14) (13, 8) (13, 0) (10, 6) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 9) (7, 8) (7, 10) (7, 18) (7, 9) (12, 8) (12, 18) (5, 19) (5, 18) (5, 3) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 2) (19, 9) (0, 16) (0, 13) (0, 18) (1, 10) (1, 4) (6, 17) (6, 10) (6, 2) (18, 7) (18, 12) (18, 5) (18, 19) (18, 0) (15, 14) (15, 9) (3, 16) (3, 14) (3, 5) (2, 14) (2, 19) (2, 6) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 19) (9, 15) (4, 1)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 16, 3, 14>
- Cycle 2: <0, 13, 8, 12>
- Cycle 3: <1, 10, 6, 17>
- Cycle 4: <1, 10, 9, 15>
- Cycle 5: <2, 14, 17, 6>
- Cycle 6: <3, 16, 11, 0>
- Cycle 7: <3, 14, 17, 6>
- Cycle 8: <5, 19, 9, 15>
- Cycle 9: <5, 18, 7, 10>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (3, 14)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (8, 13)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (6, 10)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (9, 10)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (6, 17)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (0, 16)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (3, 14)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (9, 15)
- Cycle 9 has a chord (7, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0].
