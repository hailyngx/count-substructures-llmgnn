Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 8, 14> 
- Cycle 2: <1, 7, 18, 5> 
- Cycle 3: <2, 9, 13, 5> 
- Cycle 4: <4, 17, 15, 9> 
- Cycle 5: <5, 13, 9, 6> 
- Cycle 6: <6, 9, 16, 8> 
- Cycle 7: <8, 13, 9, 6> 
- Cycle 8: <12, 18, 5, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1/Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 3, 8, 14> with a chord (8, 12)
- Cycle 2/Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 7, 18, 5> with a chord (7, 19)
- Cycle 3/Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 9, 13, 5> with a chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 4/Chordal 4-cycle: <4, 17, 15, 9> with a chord (17, 4)
- Cycle 5/Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 13, 9, 6> with a chord (13, 8)
- Cycle 6/Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 9, 16, 8> with a chord (9, 16)
- Cycle 7/Chordal 4-cycle: <8, 13, 9, 6> with a chord (9, 16)
- Cycle 8/Chordal 4-cycle: <12, 18, 5, 0> with a chord (18, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]
