Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 8) (2, 6) (2, 4) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (1, 5) (1, 8) (1, 0)

Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph. We will list all of them:
1. <0, 4, 5, 1, 0>
2. <0, 4, 7, 9, 0>
3. <0, 4, 7, 8, 0>
4. <0, 4, 3, 5, 0>
5. <1, 5, 4, 7, 1>
6. <1, 5, 8, 7, 1>
7. <2, 6, 9, 7, 2>
8. <2, 6, 8, 7, 2>
9. <3, 4, 7, 9, 3>
10. <3, 4, 7, 8, 3>
11. <4, 7, 9, 6, 4>
12. <4, 7, 8, 5, 4>
13. <5, 3, 4, 7, 5>
14. <5, 3, 8, 7, 5>
15. <6, 3, 4, 7, 6>
16. <7, 9, 6, 2, 7>
17. <7, 9, 5, 1, 7>
18. <8, 7, 4, 0, 8>
19. <8, 7, 4, 3, 8>

Step 2:
From the list above, the unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 4, 5, 1> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 4 and 1)
2. <0, 4, 7, 9> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 4 and 9)
3. <0, 4, 7, 8> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 4 and 8)
4. <0, 4, 3, 5> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 4 and 5)
5. <1, 5, 4, 7> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 5 and 7)
6. <2, 6, 9, 7> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 6 and 7)
7. <2, 6, 8, 7> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 6 and 8)
8. <3, 4, 7, 9> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 4 and 9)
9. <3, 4, 7, 8> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 4 and 8)
10. <4, 7, 9, 6> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 7 and 6)
11. <4, 7, 8, 5> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 7 and 5)
12. <5, 3, 4, 7> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 3 and 7)
13. <6, 3, 4, 7> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 3 and 7)
14. <7, 9, 6, 2> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 9 and 2)
15. <7, 9, 5, 1> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 9 and 1)
16. <8, 7, 4, 0> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 7 and 0)
17. <8, 7, 4, 3> (Connecting non-adjacent nodes 7 and 3)

Step 3:
Hence, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [17].
