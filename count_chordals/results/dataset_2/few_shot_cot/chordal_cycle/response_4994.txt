Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 9, 5, 4, 0>
- <1, 10, 4, 2, 1>
- <2, 8, 5, 4, 2>
- <3, 5, 8, 3, 13>
- <4, 5, 9, 13, 4>
- <6, 11, 0, 7, 6>
- <7, 0, 9, 13, 14>
- <13, 9, 5, 8, 13>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <1, (10, 4), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle with one chord: <3, (5, 8), 13>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]
