Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

<4, 1, 5, 8>
<4, 1, 11, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

The only cycle with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycle) is:
<<4, 1, 11, 5, (4, 11)>> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
