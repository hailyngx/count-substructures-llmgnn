2. <0, 5, 7, 12, 9>
3. <0, 5, 9, 8, 4>
4. <0, 5, 9, 12, 7>
5. <0, 5, 9, 14, 2>
6. <0, 6, 12, 9, 5>
7. <0, 6, 12, 13, 1>
8. <0, 6, 14, 2, 7>
9. <0, 10, 2, 14, 6>
10. <1, 4, 8, 9, 5>
11. <1, 4, 11, 13, 12>
12. <1, 4, 11, 8, 9>
13. <1, 4, 3, 5, 9>
14. <1, 0, 5, 9, 8>
15. <1, 0, 6, 12, 9>
16. <1, 0, 13, 12, 9>
17. <2, 7, 5, 9, 12>
18. <2, 7, 12, 13, 1>
19. <2, 7, 12, 0, 5>
20. <2, 7, 12, 9, 5>
21. <2, 7, 12, 13, 11>
22. <2, 10, 0, 5, 9>
23. <2, 14, 6, 0, 5>
24. <2, 14, 9, 5, 7>
25. <3, 5, 9, 8, 4>
26. <3, 5, 9, 12, 7>
27. <3, 5, 7, 2, 14>
28. <4, 8, 9, 12, 7>
29. <4, 8, 9, 12, 13>

35. <13, 12, 9, 8, 4>
36. <13, 12, 7, 5, 9>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 5, 7, 12, 9>
- <0, 5, 9, 8, 4>
- <1, 4, 11, 8, 9>
- <1, 0, 5, 9, 8>
- <2, 7, 12, 13, 1>
- <2, 10, 0, 5, 9>
- <4, 8, 9, 12, 7>
- <10, 8, 4, 11, 13>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [28].
