Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 6) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <0, 5, 9, 1>.
So, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
