Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 7) (3, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 6, 4, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 3, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 1, 2, 5)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 0, 2, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 8, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 6: (2, 3, 7, 8, 2)
- Cycle 7: (7, 9, 6, 4, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (1, 6) and (4, 5)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (5, 3)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (1, 2)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (1, 0)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (2, 8)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (7, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, (1, 6), (4, 5), 5)>
<2, (5, 3), 7)>
<3, (1, 2), 5)>
<4, (1, 0), 1)>
<5, (1, 7), 2)>
<6, (2, 8), 5)>
