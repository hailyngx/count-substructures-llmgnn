Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 3, 1, 4, 6>
2. <0, 3, 1, 5, 2>
3. <0, 3, 10, 5, 6>
4. <0, 3, 10, 14, 6>
5. <0, 5, 1, 4, 6>
6. <0, 5, 10, 3, 2>
7. <0, 5, 10, 14, 6>
8. <1, 3, 10, 5, 6>
9. <1, 5, 4, 13, 2>
10. <1, 5, 10, 3, 2>
11. <1, 5, 10, 14, 6>
12. <3, 1, 5, 4, 6>
13. <3, 10, 14, 6, 0>
14. <5, 1, 4, 13, 2>
15. <14, 10, 5, 1, 4>

Step 2:
Out of the above cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <0, 3, 1, 4, (5, 6)>
2. <0, 3, 1, 5, (2, 6)>
3. <0, 3, 10, 5, (6, 14)>
4. <1, 3, 10, 5, (6, 14)>
5. <1, 5, 4, 13, (2, 1)>
6. <1, 5, 10, 3, (2, 6)>
7. <3, 1, 5, 4, (6, 3)>
8. <5, 1, 4, 13, (2, 5)>
9. <14, 10, 5, 1, (4, 14)>

Step 3:
As there are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [9].
