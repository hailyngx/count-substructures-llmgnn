Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: <0, 12, 6, 1, 2, 10, 5, 9>
        - Cycle 2: <0, 12, 6, 8, 15, 19, 7, 14>
        - Cycle 3: <0, 11, 3, 16, 14, 7, 12>
        - Cycle 4: <3, 11, 0, 12, 7, 19, 8, 6>
        - Cycle 5: <5, 9, 18, 3, 16, 2, 10, 4>
        - Cycle 6: <5, 9, 18, 6, 8, 15, 4, 10>
        - Cycle 7: <5, 10, 4, 15, 8, 6, 18, 9>
        - Cycle 8: <5, 13, 5, 9, 18, 3, 16, 14>
        - Cycle 9: <7, 12, 0, 11, 3, 18, 6, 17>
        - Cycle 10: <7, 12, 17, 6, 8, 19, 15, 4>
        - Cycle 11: <7, 14, 16, 3, 11, 0, 12, 6>
        - Cycle 12: <8, 6, 17, 12, 0, 11, 3, 18>
        - Cycle 13: <8, 15, 4, 10, 2, 16, 14, 7>
        - Cycle 14: <8, 15, 19, 7, 14, 2, 1, 6>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 12, 6, 1, 2, 10, 5, 9> (Chord: (1, 5))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 12, 6, 8, 15, 19, 7, 14> (Chord: (8, 14))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, 11, 0, 12, 7, 19, 8, 6> (Chord: (3, 6))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, 13, 5, 9, 18, 3, 16, 14> (Chord: (13, 9))
        - Chordal 4-cycle 5: <8, 15, 19, 7, 14, 2, 1, 6> (Chord: (15, 1))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        [10]
