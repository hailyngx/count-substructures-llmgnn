Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (6, 9) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 3) (5, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 9) (2, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 9, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 9, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 6, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <4, 9, 1, 7> with chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 2: <4, 9, 1, 3> with chord (9, 1)
- Cycle 3: <4, 9, 6, 0> with chord (4, 6)
- Cycle 4: <4, 5, 7, 1> with chord (5, 7)
- Cycle 5: <4, 5, 2, 1> with chord (5, 2)
- Cycle 6: <4, 5, 3, 7> with chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 7: <4, 5, 2, 9> with chord (5, 9)
- Cycle 8: <4, 2, 1, 7> with chord (2, 7)
- Cycle 9: <4, 2, 9, 1> with chord (2, 9)
- Cycle 10: <4, 2, 5, 7> with chord (2, 5)
- Cycle 11: <9, 4, 8, 7> with chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 12: <9, 4, 5, 7> with chord (4, 5)
- Cycle 13: <9, 4, 2, 5> with chord (4, 2)
- Cycle 14: <9, 4, 5, 3> with chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 15: <9, 1, 7, 3> with chord (1, 3)
- Cycle 16: <9, 1, 3, 5> with chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 17: <9, 1, 2, 5> with chord (1, 2)
- Cycle 18: <9, 7, 5, 3> with chord (5, 3)
- Cycle 19: <9, 7, 1, 3> with chord (7, 1)
- Cycle 20: <9, 7, 8, 4> with chord (7, 8)

Step 2:
From the above list, we observe that Cycle 4: <4, 5, 7, 1> and Cycle 20: <9, 7, 8, 4> are the only chordal 4-cycles.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [18].
