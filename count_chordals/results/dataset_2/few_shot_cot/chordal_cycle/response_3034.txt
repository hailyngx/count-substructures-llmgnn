Response:
Step 1: Listing cycles of length 4 or more where every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle 1: (5, 11, 16, 12, 5)
2. Cycle 2: (6, 17, 18, 5, 6)
3. Cycle 3: (6, 17, 18, 9, 6)
4. Cycle 4: (8, 13, 14, 19, 11, 10, 2, 4, 1, 8)
5. Cycle 5: (11, 16, 15, 6, 19, 14, 13, 8, 12, 16)
6. Cycle 6: (0, 8, 12, 16, 15, 6, 19, 11, 10, 2, 4, 1, 9, 18, 17, 6)
7. Cycle 7: (0, 8, 1, 4, 13, 8, 12, 3, 7, 0)
8. Cycle 8: (0, 8, 1, 9, 18, 17, 6, 15, 16, 11, 19, 14, 13, 4, 2)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 6 has exactly one chord which is the edge between nodes 17 and 15.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There is only 1 chordless 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<Cycle 1, (17, 15)>
