Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 7, 15, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 7, 19, 0>
- Cycle 3: <6, 7, 16, 11, 6>
- Cycle 4: <7, 16, 11, 12, 7>
- Cycle 5: <7, 16, 18, 13, 7>
- Cycle 6: <7, 15, 4, 10, 7>
- Cycle 7: <7, 15, 17, 5, 7>
- Cycle 8: <15, 4, 10, 6, 15>
- Cycle 9: <15, 4, 6, 7, 15>
- Cycle 10: <15, 17, 5, 9, 15>
- Cycle 11: <15, 17, 5, 2, 15>
- Cycle 12: <16, 11, 1, 15, 16>
- Cycle 13: <16, 11, 1, 15, 17>
- Cycle 14: <16, 7, 6, 0, 16>
- Cycle 15: <16, 7, 6, 5, 16>
- Cycle 16: <18, 16, 7, 19, 18>
- Cycle 17: <18, 16, 7, 15, 18>
- Cycle 18: <18, 13, 6, 0, 18>
- Cycle 19: <18, 13, 7, 19, 18>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 6, 7, 15, 0> has a chord: (6, 15)
- <0, 6, 7, 19, 0> has a chord: (6, 19)
- <6, 7, 16, 11, 6> has a chord: (7, 11)
- <7, 16, 11, 12, 7> has a chord: (16, 12)
- <7, 16, 18, 13, 7> has a chord: (16, 13)
- <7, 15, 4, 10, 7> has a chord: (15, 10)
- <7, 15, 17, 5, 7> has a chord: (15, 5)
- <16, 11, 1, 15, 16> has a chord: (11, 15)
- <16, 7, 6, 0, 16> has a chord: (6, 0)
- <18, 13, 6, 0, 18> has a chord: (13, 0)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 19 cycles with chords, so the number of chordal 4-cycles is [10].
