Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <3, (25, 28), 10> because it forms a cycle 3-24-7-1-16-4-10 with only one chord, which is the edge between nodes 25 and 28. 

To count the number of chordless cycles, we need to calculate the number of cycles of length 4 or more first. After listing all cycles and checking for chords, we find that there is only one chordal 4-cycle in the graph. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
