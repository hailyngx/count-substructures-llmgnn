Response:
Here is the step-by-step process to find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 9, 14, 8, 4, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 9, 12, 7, 2, 14, 8, 4, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 2, 7, 12, 3, 18, 6, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 1, 2, 7, 16, 19, 15, 18, 6, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 1, 9, 12, 3, 18, 11, 17, 13, 0)
- Cycle 6: (4, 0, 6, 18, 11, 17, 10, 5, 3, 8, 4)
- Cycle 7: (4, 0, 6, 18, 11, 16, 7, 12, 3, 8, 4)
- Cycle 8: (5, 10, 17, 13, 0, 6, 18, 11, 16, 19, 15, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 10, 17, 11, 18, 6, 0, 13, 3, 8, 14, 9, 5)
- Cycle 10: (7, 2, 1, 9, 14, 8, 3, 12, 7)
- Cycle 11: (7, 12, 3, 8, 4, 0, 6, 18, 11, 17, 13, 7)
- Cycle 12: (3, 8, 14, 9, 12, 7, 2, 1, 0, 4, 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Only Cycle 4: <0, (11, 19), 18>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, (11, 19), 18>.
