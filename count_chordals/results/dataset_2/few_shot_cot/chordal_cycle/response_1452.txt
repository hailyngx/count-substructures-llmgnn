Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 1) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 0, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 0, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <5, 1, 4, 9, 5>
- <5, 1, 8, 7, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 1, 4, 9, 5> has a chord (9, 4) *(Chordal 4-cycle)*
- <5, 1, 8, 7, 5> does not have exactly one chord *(Chordless cycle)*

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
