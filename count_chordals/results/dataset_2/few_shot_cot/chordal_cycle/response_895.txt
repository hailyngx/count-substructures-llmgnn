Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 6) (1, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 8, 7, 6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 2)
- Cycle 3: (3, 9, 5, 2, 1, 6, 3)
- Cycle 4: (4, 5, 9, 2, 1, 6, 4)
- Cycle 5: (6, 7, 9, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 6)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for a chord:
- Cycle 1: <1, (8, 4), 7, 6>
- Cycle 2: <2, (8, 4), 3>
- Cycle 3: <3, (5, 2), 1, 6>
- Cycle 4: <4, (2, 9), 1, 6>
- Cycle 5: No chord in this cycle

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (8, 4), 7, 6>
- <3, (5, 2), 1, 6>
- <4, (2, 9), 1, 6>
