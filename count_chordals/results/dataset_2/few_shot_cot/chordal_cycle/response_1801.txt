Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
1. Cycle: 0 - 4 - 8 - 7 - 0
2. Cycle: 0 - 3 - 2 - 0
3. Cycle: 1 - 5 - 3 - 1
4. Cycle: 1 - 3 - 2 - 0 - 1
5. Cycle: 5 - 6 - 8 - 4 - 5
6. Cycle: 5 - 1 - 9 - 6 - 5
7. Cycle: 3 - 5 - 4 - 9 - 3
8. Cycle: 4 - 7 - 8 - 6 - 4
9. Cycle: 1 - 8 - 7 - 9 - 1

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (7, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 4 chordless cycles:
- <0, 3, 2, 0>
- <1, 5, 3, 1>
- <5, 6, 8, 4, 5>
- <4, 7, 8, 6, 4>

Therefore, the final answer is [4].
