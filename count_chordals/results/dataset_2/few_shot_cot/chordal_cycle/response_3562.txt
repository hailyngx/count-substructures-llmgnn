Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 2, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (0, 5, 4, 7)
- (0, 5, 1, 7)
- (0, 5, 4, 3)
- (0, 5, 1, 8)
- (0, 9, 7, 4)
- (0, 9, 7, 3)
- (0, 9, 3, 8)
- (0, 6, 8, 3)
- (1, 5, 4, 7)
- (1, 5, 4, 3)
- (1, 7, 4, 3)
- (1, 7, 3, 8)
- (2, 7, 4, 3)
- (2, 7, 3, 8)
- (3, 9, 7, 4)
- (3, 9, 7, 2)
- (4, 5, 1, 7)
- (4, 5, 1, 0)
- (4, 7, 1, 5)
- (4, 7, 1, 0)
- (4, 7, 3, 9)
- (5, 1, 7, 4)
- (5, 1, 7, 3)
- (6, 0, 5, 1)
- (6, 0, 8, 3)
- (7, 9, 3, 8)
- (8, 6, 0, 5)
- (8, 6, 0, 1)
- (8, 6, 0, 3)
- (8, 2, 7, 4)
- (8, 2, 7, 3)
- (8, 2, 3, 9)
- (9, 3, 4, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 8, 1, 5>, chord: (0, 1)
- <0, 9, 3, 8>, chord: (9, 8)
- <1, 7, 3, 9>, chord: (7, 9)
- <4, 7, 3, 9>, chord: (4, 9)
- <4, 5, 1, 7>, chord: (5, 7)
- <7, 3, 9, 4>, chord: (3, 4)
- <8, 6, 0, 1>, chord: (6, 1)
- <8, 2, 7, 3>, chord: (2, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 32 chordless cycles in the graph.

Final answer: [32]
