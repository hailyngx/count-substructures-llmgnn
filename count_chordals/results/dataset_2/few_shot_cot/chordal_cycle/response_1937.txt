Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 13, 12, 2, 5, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 13, 7, 6, 2, 12>
- Cycle 3: <0, 13, 7, 8, 5, 1>
- Cycle 4: <0, 11, 14, 9, 5, 1>
- Cycle 5: <0, 11, 12, 2, 6, 7>
- Cycle 6: <2, 6, 10, 13, 7, 3>
- Cycle 7: <5, 1, 10, 13, 7, 8>
- Cycle 8: <5, 1, 10, 6, 7, 3>
- Cycle 9: <5, 9, 4, 14, 11, 1>
- Cycle 10: <6, 2, 3, 7, 13, 8>
- Cycle 11: <6, 7, 3, 9, 4, 14>
- Cycle 12: <7, 6, 10, 13, 8, 5>
- Cycle 13: <7, 6, 10, 1, 5, 8>
- Cycle 14: <7, 8, 13, 10, 12, 11>
- Cycle 15: <9, 5, 1, 11, 14, 4>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord <1, 5>
- Cycle 2 has chord <7, 13>
- Cycle 3 has chord <7, 8>
- Cycle 4 has chord <11, 14>
- Cycle 5 has chord <6, 7>
- Cycle 6 has chord <6, 13>
- Cycle 7 has chord <1, 10>
- Cycle 8 has chord <1, 10>
- Cycle 9 has chord <1, 11>
- Cycle 10 has chord <7, 8>
- Cycle 11 has chord <7, 6>
- Cycle 12 has chord <5, 8>
- Cycle 13 has chord <5, 8>
- Cycle 14 has chord <7, 11>
- Cycle 15 has chord <1, 11>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
We found 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [15].
