Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 1) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 6, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <0, 8, 9, 5>.

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-8-9-5-1-7-6-2-0

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: 0-8

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
