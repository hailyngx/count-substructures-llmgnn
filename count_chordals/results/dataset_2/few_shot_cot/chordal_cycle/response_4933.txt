Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (2, 3) (2, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

Cycles of length 4:
1. (1, 9, 3, 1)
2. (1, 9, 7, 1)
3. (1, 3, 6, 1)
4. (3, 1, 7, 3)
5. (3, 1, 4, 3)
6. (3, 7, 8, 3)
7. (4, 1, 8, 4)
8. (4, 8, 0, 4)
9. (8, 1, 7, 8)
10. (8, 7, 9, 8)
11. (6, 1, 3, 6)
12. (6, 3, 2, 6)
13. (6, 2, 3, 6)
14. (0, 8, 7, 0)
15. (0, 7, 9, 0)
16. (2, 3, 7, 2)
17. (7, 1, 9, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (9, 3), 6)>
- <1, (9, 7), 1)>
- <3, (1, 7), 3)>
- <4, (1, 8), 4)>
- <8, (1, 7), 8)>
- <6, (1, 3), 6)>
- <6, (2, 3), 6)>
- <0, (8, 7), 0)>
- <2, (3, 7), 6)>
- <7, (1, 9), 7)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
Thus, the final number inside brackets is [10].
