Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 4, 3, 9> (chordless cycle)
- <0, 4, 14, 12>
- <0, 13, 5, 12>
- <2, 3, 9, 1>
- <2, 3, 4, 11> (chordless cycle)
- <2, 11, 6, 12>
- <4, 3, 2, 11> (chordless cycle)
- <4, 14, 3, 9>
- <5, 12, 10, 1>
- <6, 7, 2, 11>
- <7, 2, 3, 9>
- <9, 1, 10, 11>
- <10, 1, 11, 14> (chordless cycle)
- <10, 12, 6, 7>
- <11, 2, 0, 4>
- <12, 6, 7, 2>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, 4, 3, 9, (13, 5)>
- <0, 13, 5, 12, (4, 14)>
- <2, 3, 9, 1, (11, 6)>
- <2, 11, 6, 12, (7, 3)>
- <4, 14, 3, 9, (0, 13)>
- <10, 1, 11, 14, (12, 6)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is 3, and the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is 5. Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [5].
