Response:
Step 1: 
1. Cycle <0, 9, 6, 10, 0>
2. Cycle <0, 9, 3, 1, 0>
3. Cycle <0, 9, 3, 4, 10, 0>
4. Cycle <0, 9, 3, 8, 6, 10, 0>
5. Cycle <0, 9, 3, 8, 7, 2, 10, 0>
6. Cycle <0, 1, 3, 4, 10, 0>
7. Cycle <0, 1, 3, 8, 6, 10, 0>
8. Cycle <0, 1, 3, 8, 7, 2, 10, 0>
9. Cycle <0, 7, 8, 13, 6, 10, 0>
10. Cycle <0, 14, 10, 6, 9, 3, 1, 0>
11. Cycle <0, 14, 10, 6, 9, 3, 4, 10, 0>
12. Cycle <0, 14, 10, 6, 9, 3, 8, 7, 2, 10, 0>
13. Cycle <1, 3, 4, 10, 0>
14. Cycle <1, 3, 8, 6, 10, 0>
15. Cycle <1, 3, 8, 7, 2, 10, 0>
16. Cycle <3, 8, 6, 10, 0>

Step 2:
Out of the above cycles, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 6, 10, 0> with chord (6, 10)

Step 3:
There is only one chordal 4-cycle found, so the final answer is [1].
