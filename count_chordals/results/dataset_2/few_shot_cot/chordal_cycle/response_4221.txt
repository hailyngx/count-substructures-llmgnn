Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 3) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 7, 0, 4, 5)
- Cycle 3: (9, 7, 0, 8, 9)
- Cycle 4: (6, 8, 9, 5, 6)
- Cycle 5: (2, 7, 5, 9, 2)
- Cycle 6: (3, 1, 9, 5, 3)
- Cycle 7: (4, 0, 8, 6, 4)
- Cycle 8: (0, 7, 5, 2, 0)

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, we can identify the chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, (1, 9), 4>

Step 3:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
