Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (7, 2) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-5-9-0-1
- Cycle 2: 1-5-9-2-1
- Cycle 3: 1-5-6-0-1
- Cycle 4: 1-4-8-5-1
- Cycle 5: 1-4-3-8-1
- Cycle 6: 1-4-2-5-1
- Cycle 7: 1-4-2-7-1
- Cycle 8: 1-2-5-9-1
- Cycle 9: 1-2-4-8-1
- Cycle 10: 1-2-7-1
- Cycle 11: 1-0-9-5-1
- Cycle 12: 1-0-4-8-1

Step 2:
Among the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 5, 9, (0, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 5, 9, (2, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 5, 6, (0, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, 4, 8, (5, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, 4, 3, (8, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, 4, 2, (5, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, 4, 2, (7, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, 0, 9, (5, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <1, 0, 4, (8, 1)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [3].
