- <16, 3, 7, 14> 
- <16, 3, 9, 6> 
- <16, 19, 6, 17> 

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 14, 17, 10>  (Chord: (1, 17))
- <1, 13, 9, 3>  (Chord: (1, 9))
- <3, 15, 10, 17>  (Chord: (15, 10))
- <3, 7, 14, 17>  (Chord: (3, 14))
- <3, 9, 6, 17>  (Chord: (9, 6))
- <3, 16, 19, 6>  (Chord: (16, 6))
- <4, 8, 13, 1>  (Chord: (4, 13))
- <4, 8, 6, 17>  (Chord: (8, 6))
- <5, 11, 4, 8>  (Chord: (5, 4))
- <6, 17, 14, 1>  (Chord: (6, 14))
- <8, 4, 12, 4>  (Chord: (4, 12))
- <10, 15, 3, 7>  (Chord: (15, 3))
- <13, 1, 19, 6>  (Chord: (1, 6))

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [6].
