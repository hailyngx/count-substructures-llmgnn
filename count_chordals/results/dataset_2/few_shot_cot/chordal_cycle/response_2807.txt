Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 3, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 1, 13, 7, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 7, 4, 9, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 7, 12, 11, 3, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 6, 14, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 6: <5, 6, 8, 1, 5>
- Cycle 7: <1, 3, 8, 14, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 3, 11, 12, 9, 4, 7, 5, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 13, 2, 7, 5, 6, 14, 8, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 13, 6, 8, 3, 5, 7, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle 11: <3, 0, 4, 7, 5, 1, 13, 7, 12, 11, 3>
- Cycle 12: <3, 0, 10, 7, 5, 1, 13, 6, 8, 14, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle 13: <3, 8, 1, 5, 7, 4, 9, 12, 11, 3>
- Cycle 14: <4, 7, 2, 13, 6, 5, 1, 3, 11, 12, 9, 4>

Step 2: Check for chords:
- Cycle 1 has no chord
- Cycle 2 has chord <1, 7>
- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has no chord
- Cycle 5 has chord <4, 7>
- Cycle 6 has chord <1, 5>
- Cycle 7 has chord <3, 9>
- Cycle 8 has chord <1, 7>
- Cycle 9 has chord <7, 13>
- Cycle 10 has chord <1, 6>
- Cycle 11 has chord <4, 7>
- Cycle 12 has chord <3, 14>
- Cycle 13 has chord <1, 9>
- Cycle 14 has chord <4, 13>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles = 4
Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [4].
