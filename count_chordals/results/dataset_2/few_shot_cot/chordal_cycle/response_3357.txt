Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 13, 4, 9>
- Cycle 2: <0, 2, 7, 19, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 6, 5, 8>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 13, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 7, 2>
- Cycle 6: <1, 15, 8, 5>
- Cycle 7: <1, 15, 7, 6>
- Cycle 8: <1, 19, 14, 16>
- Cycle 9: <2, 0, 13, 4>
- Cycle 10: <2, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 11: <2, 7, 19, 12>
- Cycle 12: <2, 12, 8, 5>
- Cycle 13: <2, 12, 18, 11>
- Cycle 14: <2, 16, 14, 19>
- Cycle 15: <4, 9, 11, 18>
- Cycle 16: <5, 6, 1, 15>
- Cycle 17: <5, 8, 15, 7>
- Cycle 18: <7, 6, 13, 10>
- Cycle 19: <8, 5, 17, 18>
- Cycle 20: <8, 12, 19, 14>
- Cycle 21: <12, 8, 15, 7>
- Cycle 22: <13, 10, 4, 9>
- Cycle 23: <14, 19, 7, 6>
- Cycle 24: <16, 14, 19, 1>
- Cycle 25: <16, 18, 12, 8>
- Cycle 26: <17, 5, 8, 15>
- Cycle 27: <17, 18, 11, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, 6, 5, 8>, Chord: (6, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 19, 14, 16>, Chord: (19, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, 12, 8, 5>, Chord: (12, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <7, 6, 13, 10>, Chord: (6, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [23] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
