Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. <5, 9, 1, 7, 5>
2. <5, 9, 4, 1, 5>
3. <5, 8, 9, 4, 5>
4. <5, 8, 3, 1, 5>
5. <5, 6, 1, 9, 5>
6. <5, 6, 2, 0, 5>
7. <9, 4, 1, 7, 9>
8. <9, 4, 1, 6, 9>
9. <9, 7, 1, 3, 9>
10. <4, 1, 7, 0, 4>
11. <7, 5, 6, 1, 7>
12. <7, 5, 9, 8, 7>
13. <7, 0, 2, 6, 7>
14. <1, 9, 5, 6, 1>
15. <1, 9, 7, 0, 1>
16. <1, 3, 8, 9, 1>
17. <3, 1, 6, 5, 3>
18. <3, 8, 5, 9, 3>
19. <8, 5, 6, 1, 8>
20. <8, 0, 2, 5, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

From the above cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <5, 9, 1, 7, 5> with a chord between nodes 1 and 7.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [19].
