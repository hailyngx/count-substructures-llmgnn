Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 14) (6, 11) (9, 6) (9, 10) (9, 16) (8, 13) (8, 10) (8, 16) (8, 0) (13, 8) (13, 5) (13, 12) (13, 18) (3, 11) (3, 19) (3, 12) (3, 18) (11, 6) (11, 3) (11, 7) (11, 17) (11, 2) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 15) (0, 8) (0, 10) (10, 9) (10, 8) (10, 0) (10, 4) (12, 13) (12, 3) (12, 16) (12, 1) (16, 9) (16, 8) (16, 12) (16, 4) (7, 11) (7, 14) (2, 11) (2, 5) (2, 19) (17, 11) (15, 5) (19, 3) (19, 2) (14, 6) (14, 7) (14, 18) (14, 4) (18, 13) (18, 3) (18, 14) (4, 10) (4, 16) (4, 14) (1, 12)

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <3, 11, 7, 14> with the chord (11, 14).

Following Step 3, the final number of chordless cycles found is [0].
