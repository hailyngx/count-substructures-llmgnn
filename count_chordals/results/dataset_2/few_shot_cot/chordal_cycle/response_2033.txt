Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycle <5, 2, 1, 5> exists with chord (1, 2)
- The cycle <5, 1, 4, 5> exists with chord (1, 4)
- The cycle <5, 1, 3, 5> exists with chord (1, 3)
- The cycle <5, 8, 2, 5> exists with chord (2, 8)
- The cycle <2, 1, 4, 2> exists with chord (1, 4)
- The cycle <2, 1, 3, 2> exists with chord (1, 3)
- The cycle <2, 8, 5, 2> exists with chord (5, 8)
- The cycle <1, 4, 7, 1> exists with chord (1, 7)
- The cycle <1, 3, 7, 1> exists with chord (1, 7)
- The cycle <1, 6, 7, 1> exists with chord (1, 7)
- The cycle <3, 1, 4, 3> exists with chord (1, 4)
- The cycle <3, 1, 7, 3> exists with chord (1, 7)
- The cycle <4, 1, 7, 4> exists with chord (1, 7)
- The cycle <7, 4, 0, 7> exists with chord (0, 4)
- The cycle <7, 0, 2, 7> exists with chord (0, 2)

Step 2:
- Removing cycles that have more than one chord: 
    - The cycle <5, 2, 1, 5> with chord (1, 2)
    - The cycle <5, 1, 4, 5> with chord (1, 4)
    - The cycle <5, 1, 3, 5> with chord (1, 3)
    - The cycle <5, 8, 2, 5> with chord (2, 8)
    - The cycle <2, 1, 4, 2> with chord (1, 4)
    - The cycle <2, 1, 3, 2> with chord (1, 3)
    - The cycle <2, 8, 5, 2> with chord (5, 8)
    - The cycle <1, 6, 7, 1> with chord (1, 7)
    - The cycle <3, 1, 4, 3> with chord (1, 4)
    - The cycle <3, 1, 7, 3> with chord (1, 7)
    - The cycle <4, 1, 7, 4> with chord (1, 7)
    - The cycle <7, 4, 0, 7> with chord (0, 4)
    - The cycle <7, 0, 2, 7> with chord (0, 2)

Step 3: 
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [8].
