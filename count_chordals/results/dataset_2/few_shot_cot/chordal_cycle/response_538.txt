Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: <0, 10, 4, 8, 13, 1, 7, 5>
        - Cycle 2: <0, 1, 7, 6, 12, 3, 11, 2, 9>
        - Cycle 3: <0, 10, 4, 11, 2, 9, 5>
        - Cycle 4: <1, 7, 6, 8, 14, 11, 4, 10>
        - Cycle 5: <2, 9, 5, 7, 6, 12, 13, 8>
        - Cycle 6: <3, 11, 2, 9, 5, 13, 12>
        - Cycle 7: <4, 8, 14, 6, 12, 13, 5>
        - Cycle 8: <7, 5, 9, 2, 11, 4, 10>
        - Cycle 9: <7, 6, 12, 10, 4, 8, 13>
        - Cycle 10: <7, 1, 13, 12, 6, 14, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has a chord 8-13
        - Cycle 2 has a chord 6-12
        - Cycle 3 has a chord 4-11
        - Cycle 5 has a chord 9-8
        - Cycle 6 has a chord 9-5
        - Cycle 7 has a chord 8-6
        - Cycle 8 has a chord 5-9
        - Cycle 9 has a chord 6-8
        - Cycle 10 has a chord 1-14

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
        <0, 10, 4, 8, 13, 1, 7, 5>
        <7, 1, 13, 12, 6, 14, 11>
