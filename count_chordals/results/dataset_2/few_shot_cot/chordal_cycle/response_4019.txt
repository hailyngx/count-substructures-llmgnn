Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, (14, 9), 5, (10, 18, 6)>
- <0, (14, 9), 5, 4>
- <0, 14, 9, 5>
- <0, 14, 9, 12>
- <0, 14, 9, 5>
- <0, 14, 9, 12>
- <0, 19, 6, 16>
- <0, 19, 6, 18>
- <0, 19, 18, 17>
- <1, 17, 7, 4>
- <1, 17, 7, 2>
- <1, 17, 15, 5>
- <1, 17, 15, 8>
- <2, 4, 5, 9>
- <2, 4, 7, 17>
- <2, 7, 17, 18>
- <2, 16, 12, 9>
- <2, 16, 6, 19>
- <2, 16, 6, 18>

- <13, 5, 9, 12>
- <17, 7, 4, 5>
- <17, 15, 5, 9>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <<2, 4, 5, 9>, (2, 13)>
- <<2, 7, 17, 1>, (1, 15)>
- <<6, 18, 17, 1>, (1, 7)>
- <<6, 18, 17, 15>, (15, 5)>

Step 3:
There are a total of [4] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
