- Cycle: <1, 3, 7, 6, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 4, 9, 2, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 5, 2, 3, 1>
- Cycle: <1, 8, 7, 0, 1>
- Cycle: <2, 0, 6, 3, 2>
- Cycle: <2, 3, 7, 6, 2>
- Cycle: <2, 5, 1, 4, 2>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (0, 5), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, (0, 6), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, (3, 7), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, (1, 4), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, (2, 5), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <6, (0, 1), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <7, (3, 6), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <7, (2, 5), 8>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]
