Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- (0, 5, 2, 0)
- (0, 8, 1, 9, 4, 7, 2, 0)
- (1, 9, 6, 4, 1)
- (2, 5, 6, 4, 7, 2)
- (3, 4, 9, 8, 0, 3)
- (4, 9, 6, 5, 2, 7, 4)
- (5, 6, 9, 8, 0, 2, 5)
- (6, 9, 8, 1, 7, 4, 6)
- (7, 4, 6, 8, 1, 7)
- (8, 9, 6, 5, 0, 8)

Step 2:
Among these cycles, one of them has exactly one chord which is (4, 1):
- <4, 9, 6, 8, 1, 7, 4>

Step 3: 
There is only one chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
