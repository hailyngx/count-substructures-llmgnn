Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (1, 4, 7, 3, 1)
- (2, 7, 4, 3, 1, 2)
- (2, 7, 4, 11, 6, 2)
- (2, 7, 4, 12, 8, 2)
- (2, 7, 10, 5, 6, 2)
- (2, 7, 10, 8, 1, 2)
- (3, 4, 7, 2, 10, 3)
- (4, 7, 10, 5, 6, 4)
- (4, 7, 10, 8, 1, 4)
- (4, 11, 6, 5, 10, 4)
- (4, 11, 6, 2, 7, 4)
- (4, 11, 12, 8, 1, 4)
- (6, 7, 4, 11, 12, 6)
- (7, 10, 5, 6, 11, 7)
- (7, 10, 8, 12, 11, 7)
- (8, 12, 11, 6, 5, 8)
- (9, 2, 7, 4, 11, 9)
- (9, 2, 7, 10, 5, 9)
- (9, 2, 7, 10, 8, 9)
- (9, 12, 8, 2, 7, 9)
- (10, 7, 4, 11, 6, 10)
- (10, 7, 4, 3, 1, 10)
- (11, 4, 7, 10, 5, 11)
- (11, 6, 5, 10, 8, 11)
- (12, 4, 3, 1, 8, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Chordal 4-cycles: 
  - <4, (7, 2), 3, 1>
  - <7, (4, 11), 6, 2>
  - <7, (4, 12), 8, 2>
  - <7, (4, 10), 5, 6>
  - <7, (4, 10), 1, 8>
  - <4, (7, 10), 5, 6>
  - <4, (7, 10), 1, 8>
  - <4, (11, 6), 5, 10>
  - <4, (11, 6), 2, 7>
  - <4, (11, 12), 8, 1>
  - <6, (7, 4), 11, 12>
  - <10, (7, 4), 11, 6>
  - <10, (7, 4), 1, 8>
  - <12, (8, 1), 4, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are [0] chordless 4-cycles.
