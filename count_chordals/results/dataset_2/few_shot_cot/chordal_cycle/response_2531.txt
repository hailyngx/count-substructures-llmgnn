Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <4, 7, 2, 6>
- Cycle 2: <4, 8, 11, 9>
- Cycle 3: <4, 9, 10, 5>
- Cycle 4: <4, 10, 3, 11>
- Cycle 5: <7, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 6: <7, 6, 12, 3>
- Cycle 7: <7, 2, 1, 5>
- Cycle 8: <7, 2, 9, 4>
- Cycle 9: <8, 11, 3, 10>
- Cycle 10: <5, 1, 2, 9>
- Cycle 11: <5, 10, 3, 13>
- Cycle 12: <6, 12, 14, 5>
- Cycle 13: <9, 2, 13, 6>
- Cycle 14: <13, 1, 5, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has chord <7, 6>
- Cycle 2 has chord <8, 9>
- Cycle 3 has chord <9, 10>
- Cycle 4 has chord <4, 11>
- Cycle 5 has chord <2, 1>
- Cycle 6 has chord <6, 3>
- Cycle 7 has chord <2, 5>
- Cycle 8 has chord <2, 9>
- Cycle 9 has chord <11, 3>
- Cycle 10 has chord <2, 9>
- Cycle 11 has chord <10, 3>
- Cycle 12 has chord <12, 5>
- Cycle 13 has chord <9, 6>
- Cycle 14 has chord <1, 5>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 14 unique chordal 4-cycles found. So, the final count is [14].
