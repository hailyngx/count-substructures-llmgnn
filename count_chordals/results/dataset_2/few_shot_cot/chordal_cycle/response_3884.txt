Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- (2, 5, 14, 1)
- (2, 5, 8, 10)
- (2, 5, 13, 12)
- (2, 5, 9, 0)
- (2, 5, 14, 7)
- (2, 11, 0, 10)
- (2, 11, 4, 7)
- (4, 11, 12, 3)
- (4, 11, 2, 5)
- (4, 11, 0, 10)
- (4, 13, 12, 3)
- (4, 13, 7, 14)
- (4, 13, 5, 2)
- (5, 9, 0, 10)
- (5, 9, 0, 11)
- (5, 9, 0, 8)
- (5, 13, 4, 7)
- (5, 13, 7, 14)
- (5, 13, 12, 4)
- (7, 4, 11, 0)
- (7, 4, 12, 3)
- (7, 4, 13, 5)
- (7, 14, 5, 9)
- (7, 14, 2, 5)
- (8, 5, 9, 0)
- (8, 5, 14, 7)
- (8, 5, 2, 11)
- (8, 10, 0, 9)
- (8, 10, 3, 12)
- (8, 10, 1, 4)
- (12, 4, 7, 6)
- (12, 4, 13, 5)
- (12, 4, 11, 2)
- (13, 5, 2, 11)
- (13, 5, 14, 7)
- (13, 5, 9, 0)
- (14, 5, 9, 0)
- (14, 5, 13, 4)
- (14, 5, 2, 11)

Step 2: 
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- <2, 5, 14, 1> (Chord: (2, 14))
- <2, 11, 4, 7> (Chord: (11, 4))
- <4, 13, 7, 14> (Chord: (13, 7))
- <5, 9, 0, 8> (Chord: (9, 0))

Step 3: 
Since there are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [4].
