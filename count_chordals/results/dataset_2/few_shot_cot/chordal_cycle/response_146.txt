Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the provided graph are as follows:
<1, (7, 23), 19)>
<1, (22, 17), 23)>
<4, (22, 17), 23)>
<6, (24, 10), 15)>
<6, (14, 19), 23)>
<11, (14, 19), 23)>
<14, (1, 11), 4)>
<14, (19, 23), 17)>
<17, (29, 20), 18)>
<19, (23, 17), 15)>
<22, (1, 14), 11)>
<23, (17, 15), 10)>
<24, (10, 15), 17)>
<25, (13, 10), 24)>
