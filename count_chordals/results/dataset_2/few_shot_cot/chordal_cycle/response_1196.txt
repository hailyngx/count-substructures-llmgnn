    - Cycle 38: (18, 5, 12, 13)
    - Cycle 39: (19, 9, 13, 12)

Step 2:
- The chordal 4-cycles are as follows:
    - <1, (14, 15), 19>
    - <3, (0, 8), 17>
    - <4, (8, 17), 11>
    - <6, (4, 6), 18>
    - <10, (2, 17), 11>
    - <15, (12, 13), 9>
    - <17, (9, 13), 12>
    - <18, (5, 12), 13>
    - <19, (9, 13), 12>

Step 3:
- There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
