Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 9) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 1) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, 9, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 0, 2, 9, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 2, 4, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 2, 5, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 5, 1>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 9, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 3, 9, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 4, 1, 5>
- Cycle 7: <2, 5, 1, 7>
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 1, 7>
- Cycle 9: <4, 1, 5, 7>
- Cycle 10: <5, 2, 6, 4>
- Cycle 11: <5, 2, 7, 6>
- Cycle 12: <5, 3, 9, 1>

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 1: <0, 2, 4, 1> has a chord (2, 4), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 2: <0, 2, 5, 1> has a chord (2, 5), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 5, 1> has a chord (3, 5), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 9, 1> has a chord (3, 9), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 5: <2, 3, 9, 1> is chordless.
- Cycle 6: <2, 4, 1, 5> has a chord (4, 1), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 7: <2, 5, 1, 7> has a chord (5, 7), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 1, 7> has a chord (5, 7), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 9: <4, 1, 5, 7> has a chord (1, 5), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.
- Cycle 10: <5, 2, 6, 4> is chordless.
- Cycle 11: <5, 2, 7, 6> is chordless.
- Cycle 12: <5, 3, 9, 1> has a chord (3, 9), so it is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [2]

Therefore, the total number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].
