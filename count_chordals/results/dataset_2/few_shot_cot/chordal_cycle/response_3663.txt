Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (6, 1) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: Identifying all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 4>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 7, 2>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 1, 7>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 9, 8>
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 4, 9>
- Cycle 7: <1, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 8: <2, 9, 5, 7>
- Cycle 9: <2, 4, 6, 1>
- Cycle 10: <2, 7, 1, 3>
- Cycle 11: <2, 7, 0, 5>
- Cycle 12: <4, 9, 8, 7>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 7> with chord (5, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 4> with chord (5, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 6, 4, 9> with chord (6, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, 9, 5, 7> with chord (9, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- The number of chordless cycles found is 8, so the final answer is [8].
