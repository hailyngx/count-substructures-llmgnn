Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord. Based on the list of cycles above, the cycle with exactly one chord is cycle <0, 2, 9, 17>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
