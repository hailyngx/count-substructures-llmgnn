Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 9, 7, 27, 0> - Chord: (7, 0)
- <5, 14, 28, 13, 8> - Chord: (28, 13)
- <9, 7, 11, 18, 19> - Chord: (7, 18)
- <0, 14, 28, 22, 19> - Chord: (14, 22)
- <27, 7, 9, 5, 14> - Chord: (7, 5)
- <15, 13, 28, 22, 19> - Chord: (13, 22)
- <17, 13, 28, 14, 5> - Chord: (13, 14)
- <18, 11, 27, 0, 14> - Chord: (11, 0)
- <19, 22, 28, 14, 5> - Chord: (22, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found, which is 8.
Therefore, the final answer is [8].
