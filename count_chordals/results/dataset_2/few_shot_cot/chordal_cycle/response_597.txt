Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-4-2-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-3-7-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-7-2-0
- Cycle 4: 1-5-8-6-1
- Cycle 5: 1-3-7-2-1
- Cycle 6: 3-5-8-6-3
- Cycle 7: 2-4-6-8-2
- Cycle 8: 2-7-3-0-2
- Cycle 9: 4-6-2-8-4
- Cycle 10: 4-9-3-7-4
- Cycle 11: 6-8-5-1-6
- Cycle 12: 7-9-8-5-7
- Cycle 13: 5-8-4-9-5

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord (1, 8): <4, (1, 8), 6)>
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord (2, 8): <7, (2, 8), 6)>
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord (3, 7): <8, (3, 7), 2)>
- Cycle 9 has exactly one chord (4, 8): <9, (4, 8), 6)>
- Cycle 10 has exactly one chord (3, 7): <10, (3, 7), 4)>
- Cycle 11 has exactly one chord (1, 5): <11, (1, 5), 6)>
- Cycle 12 has exactly one chord (5, 8): <12, (5, 8), 7)>
- Cycle 13 has exactly one chord (4, 9): <13, (4, 9), 5)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [6]

Therefore, the final unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<4, (1, 8), 6>
<7, (2, 8), 6>
<8, (3, 7), 2>
<9, (4, 8), 6>
<10, (3, 7), 4>
<11, (1, 5), 6>
<12, (5, 8), 7>
<13, (4, 9), 5>
