Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
    - <0, (10, 14), 24>
    - <0, (17, 2), 24>
    - <2, (6, 7), 9>
    - <2, (6, 16), 28>
    - <2, (6, 18), 13>
    - <2, (17, 21), 20>
    - <2, (24, 14), 12>

    - <4, (13, 11), 29>
    - <4, (13, 18), 19>
    - <4, (22, 21), 17>
    - <4, (22, 21), 20>
    - <5, (24, 2), 17>
    - <11, (13, 18), 6>
    - <12, (14, 10), 0>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found gives us a total of [8].
