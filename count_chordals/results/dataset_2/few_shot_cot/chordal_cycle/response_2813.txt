Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 25, 2, 4, 20, 7, 12, 11, 24, 15>
- Cycle 2: <0, 25, 2, 4, 15, 3, 14, 17>
- Cycle 3: <0, 25, 28, 1, 29, 6, 12, 7, 22>
- Cycle 4: <1, 29, 6, 12, 7, 22, 23, 8>
- Cycle 5: <3, 14, 17, 22, 23, 16>
- Cycle 6: <4, 20, 7, 22, 23, 16>
- Cycle 7: <10, 3, 15, 24, 11, 9>
- Cycle 8: <10, 3, 14, 17, 22, 27>
- Cycle 9: <11, 9, 12, 7, 22, 23>
- Cycle 10: <12, 7, 22, 27, 29, 1>
- Cycle 11: <13, 1, 29, 6, 20, 7, 22>
- Cycle 12: <16, 3, 14, 17, 22, 27>

- Cycle 19: <20, 7, 22, 27, 29, 1>
- Cycle 20: <22, 17, 3, 15, 24, 11>
- Cycle 21: <22, 8, 5, 17, 14, 3>
- Cycle 22: <23, 22, 17, 3, 10, 19>
- Cycle 23: <25, 28, 1, 29, 27, 22>

Step 2: 
Among these cycles, after checking for exactly one chord, we find the chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, (14, 17), 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <12, (7, 22), 27>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have a total of [21] chordless cycles in the given graph.
