Response:
From the given graph, let's count the number of chordal 4-cycles using the steps provided:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- We will identify all possible cycles of length 4 within the graph.

Cycles of length 4: 
<0, 5, 1, 8, 0>
<0, 7, 4, 6, 2, 0>
<0, 13, 8, 1, 5, 0>
<2, 6, 1, 9, 2>
<3, 5, 1, 9, 3>
<6, 9, 5, 0, 6>
<7, 4, 6, 1, 8, 7>
<10, 9, 5, 0, 10>
<12, 7, 4, 6, 12>
<13, 8, 1, 6, 13>
<14, 7, 4, 6, 14>
<14, 11, 10, 9, 14>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Among these cycles, identify the ones with exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Unique chordal 4-cycles (with one chord):
<0, 5, 1, (8), 0>
<0, 7, 4, (6), 2, 0>
<0, 13, 8, (1), 5, 0>
<2, 6, 1, (9), 2>
<3, 5, 1, (9), 3>
<6, 9, 5, (0), 6>
<7, 4, 6, (1), 8, 7>
<10, 9, 5, (0), 10>
<12, 7, 4, (6), 12>
<13, 8, 1, (6), 13>
<14, 7, 4, (6), 14>
<14, 11, 10, (9), 14>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
As there are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found, the count of chordless cycles is [12].
