Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 9) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 4) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 8, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in this graph is:

<0, 4, 1, 9>, with a chord (0, 9)

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
