Step 2:
Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (14, 18), 2, 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (7, 24), 4, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <8, (5, 14), 18, 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <13, (22, 18), 14, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <17, (23, 8), 3, 29>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <21, (0, 19), 22, 26>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 32.

So, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
