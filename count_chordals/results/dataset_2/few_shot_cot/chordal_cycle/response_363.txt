Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <7, (11, 23), 19>. 

Now, let's determine the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (7, 11, 23, 19)
- (7, 29, 15, 5)
- (11, 23, 9, 14)
- (15, 29, 2, 28)
- (19, 22, 16, 28)
- (19, 23, 20, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle (7, 11, 23, 19) has chord (11, 23)
- Cycle (7, 29, 15, 5) has no chord
- Cycle (11, 23, 9, 14) has no chord
- Cycle (15, 29, 2, 28) has no chord
- Cycle (19, 22, 16, 28) has no chord
- Cycle (19, 23, 20, 1) has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found, which is 1.

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
