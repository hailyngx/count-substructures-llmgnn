Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (6, 7) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 5) (1, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 9) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 8, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, 5, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, and node 0

Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 1-4-7-2-1
- Cycle 2: 1-4-3-0-1
- Cycle 3: 1-4-3-2-1
- Cycle 4: 1-7-9-8-1
- Cycle 5: 1-7-2-8-1
- Cycle 6: 3-4-8-2-3
- Cycle 7: 3-4-8-5-3
- Cycle 8: 3-4-7-6-3
- Cycle 9: 3-2-5-8-3
- Cycle 10: 3-2-7-6-3

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 4: 1-7-9-8-1 has the chord (7, 8)
- Cycle 6: 3-4-8-2-3 has the chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 9: 3-2-5-8-3 has the chord (2, 8)

Now, let's count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 7.

Therefore, the final answer is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, 7, 9, 8>.
