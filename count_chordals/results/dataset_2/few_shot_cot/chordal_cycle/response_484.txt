Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 4, 7, 3>
2. Cycle <1, 5, 4, 7>
3. Cycle <1, 5, 2, 7>
4. Cycle <1, 4, 7, 8>
5. Cycle <1, 4, 0, 9>
6. Cycle <1, 3, 7, 6>
7. Cycle <2, 5, 4, 1>
8. Cycle <2, 5, 7, 8>
9. Cycle <2, 1, 4, 0>
10. Cycle <2, 1, 3, 7>
11. Cycle <4, 5, 2, 7>
12. Cycle <4, 7, 3, 8>
13. Cycle <6, 7, 2, 5>
14. Cycle <6, 7, 8, 3>

Step 2:  
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
1. Chordal cycle <0, 4, 7, 3> with chord (4, 7)
2. Chordal cycle <1, 5, 4, 7> with chord (5, 4)
3. Chordal cycle <1, 5, 2, 7> with chord (5, 2)
4. Chordal cycle <1, 4, 0, 9> with chord (4, 9)
5. Chordal cycle <2, 1, 3, 7> with chord (1, 3)
6. Chordal cycle <4, 5, 2, 7> with chord (5, 2)

Step 3:  
Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [8].
