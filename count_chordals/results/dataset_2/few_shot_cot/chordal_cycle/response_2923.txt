Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 2) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, 8, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
- One cycle of length 4: (1, 3, 7, 1)
- Two cycles of length 5: (1, 3, 7, 2, 1), (4, 3, 0, 6, 4)
- One cycle of length 6: (1, 3, 7, 2, 0, 6, 1)
- One cycle of length 6: (4, 3, 0, 8, 1, 7, 4)
- One cycle of length 6: (1, 3, 0, 8, 1, 6, 4)

Step 2:
- The cycle (1, 3, 7, 1) has a chord 1-7 <1, (1, 7), 3)>
- The cycle (1, 3, 7, 2, 1) has a chord 1-2 <2, (1, 2), 3)>
- The cycle (4, 3, 0, 6, 4) has a chord 4-6 <3, (4, 6), 0)>
- The cycle (1, 3, 7, 2, 0, 6, 1) has a chord 1-0 <4, (1, 0), 3)>
- The cycle (4, 3, 0, 8, 1, 7, 4) has a chord 4-8 <5, (4, 8), 0)>
- The cycle (1, 3, 0, 8, 1, 6, 4) has a chord 1-8 <6, (1, 8), 3)>

Step 3:
After identifying the unique chordal 4-cycles, we find that there are 6 such cycles.
Therefore, the final count is [6].
