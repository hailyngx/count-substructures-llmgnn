Response:
Step 1: 
- There are 4-cycles: <2, 8, 18, 11>, <4, 12, 0, 16>, <5, 13, 17, 6>, <8, 18, 9, 3>, <8, 15, 0, 2>, <9, 18, 11, 4>, <12, 2, 15, 0>, <13, 6, 7, 17>, <13, 16, 0, 14>, <13, 17, 3, 0>, <14, 1, 19, 18>, <15, 0, 12, 2>
- There are no 4-cycles longer than 4 in the graph.

Step 2:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle with a single chord is <13, 16, 14, 5>, where the chord is (13, 14).

Step 3:
- The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [11].
