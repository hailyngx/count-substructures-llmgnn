Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, 10, 23, 20> with the chord (10, 20).

Following the steps for counting chordal 4-cycles:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 10, 23, 20, 24>
- Cycle 2: <0, 10, 23, 20, 25>
- Cycle 3: <0, 10, 23, 6, 25>
- Cycle 4: <10, 0, 14, 6, 25>
- Cycle 5: <23, 10, 0, 25, 24>
- Cycle 6: <23, 10, 0, 14, 6>
- Cycle 7: <20, 23, 10, 0, 14>
- Cycle 8: <20, 23, 10, 0, 25>
- Cycle 9: <24, 20, 23, 10, 0>
- Cycle 10: <24, 25, 0, 14, 6>
- Cycle 11: <24, 25, 0, 10, 23>
- Cycle 12: <6, 25, 0, 14, 10>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 10, 23, 20> with chord (10, 20)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is [1].
