Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 9) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 0) (0, 5) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 9, 4, 3>
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 9, 4, 3>
- Cycle 3: <2, 9, 4, 3, 1>
- Cycle 4: <3, 5, 9, 4, 3>
- Cycle 5: <4, 9, 5, 3, 1>
- Cycle 6: <5, 9, 4, 3, 0>
- Cycle 7: <6, 5, 9, 4, 3>
- Cycle 8: <7, 9, 4, 3, 1>
- Cycle 9: <8, 5, 9, 4, 3>
- Cycle 10: <9, 4, 3, 1, 2>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <3, 5, 9, 4, 3> with the chord (3, 9).

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [9].
