Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (3, 4) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 4) (8, 9) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 5) (0, 6) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 5) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 7) (2, 5) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 7, 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 7, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 0, 7, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 0, 6, 9, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
- <0, 1, 5, 4, 0>
- <0, 1, 5, 7, 0>
- <0, 1, 2, 7, 0>
- <0, 6, 7, 5, 0>

Step 2:
The cycle <0, 1, 2, 7, 0> has exactly one chord 2-7.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [3]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, 1, 2, 7, 0>
