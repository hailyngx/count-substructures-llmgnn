Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
  - Cycle 1: <3, 15, 1, 9, 3>
  - Cycle 2: <3, 17, 14, 12, 6, 3>
  - Cycle 3: <3, 5, 2, 8, 4, 19, 6, 12, 14, 17, 3>
  - Cycle 4: <3, 8, 4, 16, 10, 14, 17, 3>
  - Cycle 5: <3, 7, 18, 2, 5, 12, 6, 0, 18, 7, 11, 1, 15, 3>
  - Cycle 6: <15, 1, 9, 19, 6, 12, 14, 17, 10, 16, 4, 8, 3, 15>

Step 2:
- The cycles with exactly one chord (one non-adjacent edge within the cycle) are:
  - Chordal Cycle 1: <3, 15, 1, 9, 3>. Chord: (15, 9)
  - Chordal Cycle 2: <3, 17, 14, 12, 6, 3>. Chord: (17, 12)
  - Chordal Cycle 3: <3, 5, 2, 8, 4, 19, 6, 12, 14, 17, 3>. Chord: (4, 17)
  - Chordal Cycle 4: <3, 8, 4, 16, 10, 14, 17, 3>. Chord: (4, 10)
  - Chordal Cycle 5: <3, 7, 18, 2, 5, 12, 6, 0, 18, 7, 11, 1, 15, 3>. Chord: (5, 18) 
  - Chordal Cycle 6: <15, 1, 9, 19, 6, 12, 14, 17, 10, 16, 4, 8, 3, 15>. Chord: (9, 6)

Step 3:
- Count of chordless cycles found: [0] (There are no chordless cycles in this graph)

Therefore, the final count is [6].
