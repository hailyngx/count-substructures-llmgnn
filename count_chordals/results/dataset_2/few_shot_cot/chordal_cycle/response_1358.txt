Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 2) (5, 4) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 9) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 5, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 0, 5, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 9, 8, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph, some of them are as follows:
1. <0, 4, 7, 2>
2. <0, 4, 5, 6>
3. <1, 6, 3, 9>
4. <2, 7, 4, 5>
5. <3, 6, 4, 7>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles mentioned above:
- In cycle <0, 4, 7, 2>, the chord is (4, 7)
- In cycle <0, 4, 5, 6>, the chord is (4, 6)
- In cycle <1, 6, 3, 9>, the chord is (6, 3)
- In cycle <2, 7, 4, 5>, the chord is (7, 5)
- In cycle <3, 6, 4, 7>, the chord is (6, 4)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles, we see that there are no chordless cycles.
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
