Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 8) (2, 10) (2, 14) (2, 7) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 12) (0, 6) (0, 10) (0, 11) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 9) (14, 12) (13, 12) (13, 4) (13, 3) (1, 6) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 7) (10, 2) (10, 0) (10, 3) (10, 4) (10, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 14) (7, 1) (7, 11) (7, 9) (11, 0) (11, 1) (11, 7) (4, 13) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 9) (9, 14) (9, 10) (9, 7) (9, 4) (12, 8) (12, 14) (12, 13) (12, 3) (3, 5) (3, 13) (3, 10) (3, 12)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- The only cycle of length 4 in the graph is <0, 6, 1, 4>.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

- The cycle <0, 6, 1, 4> has exactly one chord: (0, 1).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- As the only cycle of length 4 has a chord, there are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
