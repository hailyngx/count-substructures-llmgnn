Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 9) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 5) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 5) (0, 6) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 6, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 5, 6, 4>
2. <0, 5, 2, 4>
3. <1, 7, 4, 8>
4. <1, 7, 9, 6>
5. <2, 4, 7, 9>
6. <3, 7, 9, 6>
7. <2, 4, 8, 6>
8. <2, 4, 7, 6>
9. <3, 7, 4, 6>
10. <5, 3, 9, 6>
11. <0, 5, 3, 9>

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. Cycles 1, 2, 4, 7 each have a unique chord. 
So, [4] chordal 4-cycles were found in the graph.

Step 3: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, 5, 6, 4> with chord (5, 2)
2. <0, 5, 2, 4> with chord (5, 3)
3. <1, 7, 4, 8> with chord (7, 9)
4. <1, 7, 9, 6> with chord (7, 4)
