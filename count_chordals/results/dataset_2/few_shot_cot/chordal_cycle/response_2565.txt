Response:
Step 1: 
List of all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 6, 11, 14, 3, 13, 10>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 11, 7, 14, 6, 2, 13>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 5, 8>
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 4, 6, 14, 7>
- Cycle 7: <1, 9, 4, 11, 7, 14>
- Cycle 8: <1, 9, 4, 12, 10, 13>
- Cycle 9: <1, 10, 13, 3, 11, 7>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 6, 14, 7, 11, 3, 1> has chord (4, 11)
- Cycle 2: <1, 9, 5, 8> has chord (5, 8)
- Cycle 3: <1, 9, 4, 12, 10, 13> has chord (4, 10)

Step 3:
Number of unique chordal 4-cycles found: [3]
