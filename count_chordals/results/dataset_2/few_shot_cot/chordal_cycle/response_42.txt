Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 1, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 8, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 9, 5, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 3, 2, 1, 5, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 3, 4, 9, 5, 0>
- Cycle 7: <1, 5, 9, 6, 4, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 7, 8, 5, 0, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 7, 8, 6, 5, 2>
- Cycle 10: <2, 8, 5, 9, 6, 2>
- Cycle 11: <3, 9, 4, 6, 5, 3>
- Cycle 12: <4, 9, 5, 8, 6, 4>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- In Cycle 1, <0, 5, 1, 2, 0> has chord {1, 2}.
- In Cycle 2, <0, 5, 9, 1, 2, 0> has chord {1, 9}.
- In Cycle 3, <0, 5, 8, 2, 0> has chord {5, 8}.
- In Cycle 4, <0, 3, 9, 5, 0> has chord {3, 9}.
- In Cycle 5, <0, 3, 2, 1, 5, 0> has chord {1, 2}.
- In Cycle 6, <0, 3, 4, 9, 5, 0> has chord {3, 4}.
- In Cycle 7, <1, 5, 9, 6, 4, 1> has chord {5, 6}.
- In Cycle 8, <2, 7, 8, 5, 0, 2> has chord {5, 8}.
- In Cycle 9, <2, 7, 8, 6, 5, 2> has chord {5, 6}.
- In Cycle 10, <2, 8, 5, 9, 6, 2> has chord {5, 9}.
- In Cycle 11, <3, 9, 4, 6, 5, 3> has chord {4, 6}.
- In Cycle 12, <4, 9, 5, 8, 6, 4> has chord {5, 8}.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 12 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [12].
