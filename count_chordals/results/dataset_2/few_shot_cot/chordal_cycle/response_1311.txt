Response:
Step 1: 
- <5, 9, 18, 15>
- <2, 6, 12, 14>
- <3, 1, 13, 15>
- <5, 16, 13, 14>
- <0, 7, 10, 17>
- <0, 4, 18, 11>
- <9, 15, 13, 11>
- <8, 17, 18, 11>
- <3, 1, 14, 12>
- <2, 16, 13, 11>
- <2, 12, 14, 5>
- <7, 0, 4, 18>
- <7, 10, 2, 6>
- <9, 11, 13, 1>
- <18, 0, 4, 7>
- <15, 19, 3, 1>
- <5, 16, 2, 6>
- <9, 5, 8, 17>
- <15, 13, 1, 3>
- <18, 17, 8, 5>

Step 2:
- <5, 16, 13, 14> has chord (13, 16)
- <2, 16, 13, 11> has chord (13, 16)
- <9, 15, 13, 11> has chord (13, 15)
- <18, 17, 8, 5> has chord (8, 17)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]
