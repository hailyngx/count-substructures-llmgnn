Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <0, 4, 13, 14>.

Following the steps provided above to count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more ensuring every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 15 - 10 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 4 - 8 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 15 - 10 - 17 - 0
- Cycle 4: 2 - 3 - 8 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 5: 2 - 8 - 18 - 9 - 2
- Cycle 6: 2 - 18 - 0 - 4 - 2
- Cycle 7: 2 - 18 - 8 - 3 - 2
- Cycle 8: 4 - 8 - 3 - 10 - 4
- Cycle 9: 4 - 8 - 12 - 13 - 4
- Cycle 10: 8 - 12 - 1 - 2 - 8
- Cycle 11: 10 - 15 - 4 - 8 - 10
- Cycle 12: 10 - 16 - 13 - 4 - 10
- Cycle 13: 11 - 17 - 10 - 15 - 11
- Cycle 14: 11 - 17 - 10 - 3 - 11
- Cycle 15: 13 - 14 - 7 - 11 - 13
- Cycle 16: 13 - 14 - 7 - 1 - 13
- Cycle 17: 14 - 13 - 16 - 10 - 14
- Cycle 18: 15 - 10 - 3 - 2 - 15
- Cycle 19: 18 - 2 - 3 - 8 - 18
- Cycle 20: 18 - 2 - 8 - 4 - 18
- Cycle 21: 18 - 9 - 1 - 2 - 18
- Cycle 22: 19 - 0 - 18 - 9 - 19
- Cycle 23: 19 - 0 - 15 - 10 - 19

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: Chord (4, 15)
- Cycle 2: Chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 3: Chord (10, 17)
- Cycle 4: No Chord
- Cycle 5: No Chord
- Cycle 6: No Chord
- Cycle 7: No Chord
- Cycle 8: No Chord
- Cycle 9: No Chord
- Cycle 10: Chord (12, 1)
- Cycle 11: Chord (8, 4)
- Cycle 12: Chord (16, 13)
- Cycle 13: Chord (15, 10)
- Cycle 14: Chord (17, 10)
- Cycle 15: Chord (7, 11)
- Cycle 16: No Chord
- Cycle 17: No Chord
- Cycle 18: No Chord
- Cycle 19: No Chord
- Cycle 20: Chord (4, 8)
- Cycle 21: Chord (1, 9)
- Cycle 22: Chord (0, 18)
- Cycle 23: Chord (15, 10)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found = 8

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [8].
