Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <5, 19, 27, 15>
- Cycle 2: <4, 16, 8, 13>
- Cycle 3: <12, 9, 6, 19>
- Cycle 4: <17, 6, 12, 3>
- Cycle 5: <22, 16, 8, 20>
- Cycle 6: <25, 19, 27, 22>
- Cycle 7: <29, 26, 27, 15>
- Cycle 8: <23, 4, 16, 8>
- Cycle 9: <10, 5, 19, 27>
- Cycle 10: <2, 9, 6, 17>
- Cycle 11: <13, 8, 16, 4>
- Cycle 12: <20, 8, 16, 4>
- Cycle 13: <28, 2, 9, 6>
- Cycle 14: <3, 29, 26, 27>
- Cycle 15: <14, 29, 26, 24>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <5, 19, 27, 15> has chord (19, 15)
- <4, 16, 8, 13> has chord (16, 8)
- <12, 9, 6, 19> has chord (9, 6)
- <17, 6, 12, 3> has chord (6, 12)
- <22, 16, 8, 20> has chord (16, 8)
- <25, 19, 27, 22> has chord (19, 27)
- <29, 26, 27, 15> has chord (26, 27)
- <23, 4, 16, 8> has chord (4, 16)
- <10, 5, 19, 27> has chord (5, 19)
- <2, 9, 6, 17> has chord (9, 6)
- <13, 8, 16, 4> has chord (8, 16)
- <20, 8, 16, 4> has chord (8, 16)
- <28, 2, 9, 6> has chord (2, 9)
- <3, 29, 26, 27> has chord (29, 26)
- <14, 29, 26, 24> has chord (26, 29)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is 15.
Therefore, the final answer is [15].
