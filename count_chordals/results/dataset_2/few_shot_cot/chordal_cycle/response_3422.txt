Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 6) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 1) (6, 2) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 0, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 3, 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 9, 7, 6, 4, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 5, 2, 6, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 9, 3, 8, 6, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 5, 9, 7, 6, 8, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 9, 7, 6, 4, 1, 6, 8, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 1-4
- Cycle 2 has a chord 8-3
- Cycle 3 has a chord 7-4
- Cycle 4 has a chord 0-6
- Cycle 5 has a chord 5-8
- Cycle 6 has a chord 2-7
- Cycle 7 has no chords

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There is one chordless cycle found, which is Cycle 7.

Final count: [1]
