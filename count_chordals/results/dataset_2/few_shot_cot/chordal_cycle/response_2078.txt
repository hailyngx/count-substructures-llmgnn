Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 17, 8, 3, 15>: chordless cycle
- <0, 17, 18, 13, 12, 5>: chordless cycle
- <1, 2, 17, 18, 13, 12>: chordless cycle
- <1, 15, 3, 9, 11, 16>: chordless cycle

Step 2: 
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 17, 8, 3, 15> has exactly one chord: (15, 9) -> <0, 17, 15, 9, 3, 8>
- <0, 17, 18, 13, 12, 5> has exactly one chord: (5, 10) -> <0, 17, 18, 13, 12, 5>
- <1, 2, 17, 18, 13, 12> has exactly one chord: (1, 15) -> <1, 2, 17, 18, 13, 12>
- <1, 15, 3, 9, 11, 16> has exactly one chord: (1, 2) -> <1, 15, 3, 9, 11, 16>

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, 17, 8, 3, 15>
