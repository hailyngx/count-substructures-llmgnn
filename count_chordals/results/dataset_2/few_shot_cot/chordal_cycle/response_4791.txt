Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 10) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 12) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 4) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 6) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 7) (6, 0) (6, 13) (0, 6) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (14, 3) (14, 0) (14, 7) (14, 4) (14, 13) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (4, 1) (4, 0) (4, 14) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 5) (12, 9) (12, 4) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 14) (7, 11) (11, 1) (11, 0) (11, 7) (11, 2) (2, 0) (2, 11) (2, 10) (13, 6) (13, 14) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 11, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 11, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 14, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 0, 14, 12, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 12, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, 0, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 14, and node 11
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 1, 7, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 0, 7, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 4
Node 13 is connected to node 6, and node 14
Node 14 is connected to node 3, 0, 7, 4, and node 13

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (0, 6, 5, 8, 9, 1, 4, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 4, 12, 9, 5, 6, 3, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 4, 14, 7, 9, 5, 6, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 11, 1, 9, 5, 6, 3, 0)
- Cycle 5: (2, 0, 4, 12, 9, 5, 10, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 11, 7, 9, 5, 10, 2)
- Cycle 7: (3, 1, 9, 5, 6, 14, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (5, 8), 9, 1, 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (4, 12), 9, 5, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (4, 14), 7, 9, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, (1, 9), 5, 6, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final count is [4].
