Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
1. (10, 1, 8, 9, 10)
2. (10, 13, 5, 6, 10)
3. (10, 1, 13, 0, 10)
4. (10, 6, 5, 13, 10)
5. (10, 13, 1, 0, 10)
6. (11, 2, 9, 14, 11)
7. (11, 0, 1, 14, 11)
8. (11, 14, 9, 2, 11)
9. (12, 7, 6, 5, 12)
10. (12, 6, 10, 11, 12)
11. (12, 5, 6, 10, 12)
12. (12, 11, 10, 7, 12)
13. (12, 10, 6, 7, 12)
14. (13, 1, 0, 9, 13)
15. (13, 5, 6, 10, 13)
16. (13, 0, 9, 2, 13)
17. (13, 10, 6, 5, 13)
18. (13, 9, 2, 14, 13)
19. (14, 1, 0, 11, 14)
20. (14, 9, 2, 11, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
1. <10, 1, 13, 0>
2. <10, 6, 5, 13>
3. <11, 2, 9, 14>
4. <12, 5, 6, 10>
5. <13, 9, 2, 14>
6. <14, 1, 0, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [6].
