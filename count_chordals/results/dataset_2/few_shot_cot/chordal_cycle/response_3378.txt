Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (2, 4) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - (0, 9, 6, 3, 1, 2, 0) - Cycle of length 6
        - (0, 9, 6, 4, 2, 0) - Cycle of length 5
        - (1, 3, 6, 4, 2, 1) - Cycle of length 5
        - (1, 3, 6, 9, 8, 1) - Cycle of length 5
        - (1, 7, 0, 4, 2, 1) - Cycle of length 5
        - (1, 7, 2, 4, 0, 1) - Cycle of length 5
        - (1, 8, 0, 4, 6, 1) - Cycle of length 5
        - (2, 0, 4, 6, 3, 2) - Cycle of length 5
        - (2, 1, 3, 6, 4, 2) - Cycle of length 5
        - (3, 6, 4, 0, 7, 3) - Cycle of length 5

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

        From the above list, the following cycle has exactly one chord:
        - (0, 9, 6, 3, 1, 2, 0) - Chord: (1, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

        As we found 1 chordal 4-cycle, the final count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, 9, 6, 3>
