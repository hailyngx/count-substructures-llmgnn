Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 28, 16, 0, 3, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 28, 18, 7, 3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (3, 0, 2, 17, 11, 9, 3)
- Cycle 4: (26, 22, 27, 1, 23, 12, 26)
- Cycle 5: (7, 25, 27, 22, 26, 15, 7)
- Cycle 6: (2, 17, 11, 20, 12, 23, 2)
- Cycle 7: (4, 5, 10, 9, 2, 17, 4)
- Cycle 8: (12, 4, 5, 22, 27, 25, 12)
- Cycle 9: (13, 24, 18, 7, 25, 13)
- Cycle 10: (19, 13, 9, 11, 17, 2, 19)
- Cycle 11: (20, 8, 12, 4, 5, 10, 20)
- Cycle 12: (21, 29, 21)
- Cycle 13: (22, 26, 15, 5, 4, 12, 22)
- Cycle 14: (23, 12, 20, 13, 24, 28, 23)
- Cycle 15: (0, 16, 28, 24, 13, 19, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 6, 28, 16, 0, 3, 1> has chord (6, 28)
- <1, 6, 28, 18, 7, 3, 1> has chord (7, 18)
- <3, 0, 2, 17, 11, 9, 3> has chord (2, 11)
- <26, 22, 27, 1, 23, 12, 26> has chord (1, 12)
- <7, 25, 27, 22, 26, 15, 7> has chord (25, 26)
- <2, 17, 11, 20, 12, 23, 2> has chord (11, 23)
- <4, 5, 10, 9, 2, 17, 4> has chord (5, 9)
- <12, 4, 5, 22, 27, 25, 12> has chord (5, 27)
- <13, 24, 18, 7, 25, 13> has chord (18, 25)
- <19, 13, 9, 11, 17, 2, 19> has chord (9, 17)
- <20, 8, 12, 4, 5, 10, 20> has chord (12, 5)
- <21, 29, 21> has no chord
- <22, 26, 15, 5, 4, 12, 22> has chord (15, 4)
- <23, 12, 20, 13, 24, 28, 23> has chord (12, 24)
- <0, 16, 28, 24, 13, 19, 0> has chord (16, 24)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [1]
