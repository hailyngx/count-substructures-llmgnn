Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 2) (6, 8) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (4, 1) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 1, 5, 2, 0>
- <0, 1, 5, 9, 7, 0>
- <0, 3, 7, 9, 8, 0>
- <1, 5, 9, 6, 2, 1>
- <1, 2, 7, 9, 5, 1>
- <2, 5, 9, 6, 2>
- <3, 1, 5, 9, 7, 3>
- <7, 5, 9, 6, 8, 7>
- <8, 9, 5, 7, 3, 8>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, (1, 5), 2, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, (3, 7), 9, 8, 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (5, 9), 6, 2, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (2, 7), 9, 5, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <2, (5, 9), 6, 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <3, (1, 5), 9, 7, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <7, (5, 9), 6, 8, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <8, (9, 5), 7, 3, 8>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
