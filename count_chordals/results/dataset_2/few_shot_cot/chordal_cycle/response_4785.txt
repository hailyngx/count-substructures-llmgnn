Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

<0, 14, 4, 9>, length 4
<0, 14, 16, 10>, length 4
<0, 2, 6, 5>, length 4
<0, 2, 19, 1>, length 4
<0, 13, 1, 19>, length 4
<0, 13, 3, 18>, length 4
<0, 10, 16, 14>, length 4
<1, 13, 0, 14>, length 4
<1, 13, 3, 18>, length 4
<1, 19, 2, 6>, length 4
<1, 19, 17, 9>, length 4
<2, 6, 5, 12>, length 4
<2, 6, 11, 18>, length 4
<3, 8, 10, 16>, length 4
<3, 8, 3, 13>, length 4
<3, 18, 11, 5>, length 4
<4, 9, 17, 12>, length 4
<4, 14, 0, 13>, length 4
<5, 6, 12, 10>, length 4
<5, 6, 11, 18>, length 4
<6, 5, 11, 18>, length 4
<9, 4, 14, 16>, length 4
<9, 17, 12, 5>, length 4
<10, 8, 3, 13>, length 4
<10, 8, 3, 18>, length 4
<10, 0, 14, 4>, length 4
<10, 0, 13, 1>, length 4
<10, 16, 14, 0>, length 4
<11, 5, 6, 2>, length 4
<11, 5, 6, 12>, length 4
<11, 18, 3, 8>, length 4
<12, 5, 6, 2>, length 4
<12, 5, 11, 18>, length 4
<12, 6, 2, 19>, length 4
<16, 14, 0, 2>, length 4
<17, 9, 4, 14>, length 4
<17, 12, 6, 5>, length 4
<18, 11, 5, 6>, length 4
<18, 11, 5, 12>, length 4

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

<0, 14, 4, 9> has a chord (4, 9)
<0, 2, 6, 5> has a chord (2, 5)
<0, 13, 1, 19> has a chord (1, 19)
<0, 13, 3, 18> has a chord (3, 18)
<1, 19, 2, 6> has a chord (2, 6)
<4, 9, 17, 12> has a chord (9, 12)
<5, 6, 12, 10> has a chord (6, 10)
<10, 8, 3, 13> has a chord (8, 13)
<11, 5, 6, 2> has a chord (5, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
