Node 7 is connected to node 12, 10, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 7, 12, 0, and node 14
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 11, and node 1
Node 10 is connected to node 3, 7, 13, and node 5
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, 13, and node 5

Node 13 is connected to node 1, 0, 10, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 2, 5, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 14, 5, 12>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 1, 13, 10>
- Cycle 3: <0, 13, 1, 9, 4>
- Cycle 4: <5, 11, 9, 4, 6>
- Cycle 5: <5, 14, 8, 7, 12>
- Cycle 6: <5, 14, 2, 9, 4>
- Cycle 7: <5, 12, 3, 1, 13>
- Cycle 8: <8, 7, 10, 13, 1>
- Cycle 9: <8, 7, 12, 3, 6>
- Cycle 10: <8, 14, 2, 11, 6>
- Cycle 11: <11, 6, 4, 9, 2>
- Cycle 12: <11, 6, 3, 1, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
  - <0, 8, 1, 13, 10> with chord (8, 13)
  - <5, 14, 8, 7, 12> with chord (14, 7)
  - <8, 7, 10, 13, 1> with chord (7, 13)
  - <8, 14, 2, 11, 6> with chord (14, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- There are 8 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [4].
