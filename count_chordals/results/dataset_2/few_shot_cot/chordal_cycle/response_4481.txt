Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 8) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 2) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 4, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 7, 9, 4>
2. <1, 4, 9, 3>
3. <2, 3, 9, 4>
4. <2, 4, 8, 7>
5. <3, 1, 7, 9>
6. <4, 1, 5, 8>
7. <4, 2, 8, 6>
8. <5, 1, 3, 8>
9. <7, 0, 9, 4>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for a chord:
- <0, 7, 9, 4> has a chord (7, 9)
- <1, 4, 9, 3> has a chord (4, 9)
- <2, 3, 9, 4> has a chord (2, 9)
- <2, 4, 8, 7> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <3, 1, 7, 9> has a chord (1, 9)
- <4, 1, 5, 8> has a chord (1, 8)
- <4, 2, 8, 6> is a chordal 4-cycle
- <5, 1, 3, 8> has a chord (1, 8)
- <7, 0, 9, 4> has a chord (0, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are two chordless cycles found: <2, 4, 8, 7> and <4, 2, 8, 6>, so the final answer is [2].
