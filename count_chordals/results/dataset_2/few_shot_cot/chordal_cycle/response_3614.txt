Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 1) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 4, 2, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle <0, 1, 9, 7> with edges (0, 1), (1, 9), (9, 7), and (7, 0)
2. Cycle <0, 1, 6, 5> with edges (0, 1), (1, 6), (6, 5), and (5, 0)
3. Cycle <0, 1, 9, 5> with edges (0, 1), (1, 9), (9, 5), and (5, 0)
4. Cycle <2, 3, 9, 5> with edges (2, 3), (3, 9), (9, 5), and (5, 2)
5. Cycle <2, 3, 8, 4> with edges (2, 3), (3, 8), (8, 4), and (4, 2)
6. Cycle <2, 4, 6, 8> with edges (2, 4), (4, 6), (6, 8), and (8, 2)
7. Cycle <4, 5, 6, 8> with edges (4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 8), and (8, 4)
8. Cycle <5, 6, 8, 3> with edges (5, 6), (6, 8), (8, 3), and (3, 5)
9. Cycle <5, 9, 1, 6> with edges (5, 9), (9, 1), (1, 6), and (6, 5)
10. Cycle <7, 9, 5, 3> with edges (7, 9), (9, 5), (5, 3), and (3, 7)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 1, 9, 7> with chord (1, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 4, 6, 8> with chord (4, 8)

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found = 10 - 2 = 8

Final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph: [2]
