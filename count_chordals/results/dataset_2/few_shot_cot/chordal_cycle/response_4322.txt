Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 8) (2, 6) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 9, 5, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 9, 1, 8, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 4, 6, 5, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 5, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 8, 0, 9, 5, 1>
- Cycle 8: <3, 6, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 9: <4, 6, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle 10: <5, 6, 9, 1, 5>
- Cycle 11: <5, 7, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 12: <5, 8, 3, 6, 5>
- Cycle 13: <6, 9, 1, 5, 6>
- Cycle 14: <7, 5, 8, 3, 7>
- Cycle 15: <9, 1, 5, 7, 9>

Step 2: Check for unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 6, 5, 7> with chord (6, 9)
- <0, 6, 9, 5> with chord (6, 5)
- <1, 5, 7, 4> with chord (5, 9)
- <1, 5, 9, 6> with chord (5, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [11]
