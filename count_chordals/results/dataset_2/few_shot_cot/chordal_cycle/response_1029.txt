Response:
Step 1: 
1. Cycle <0, 6, 5, 1, 8>
2. Cycle <0, 6, 5, 7, 3>
3. Cycle <0, 8, 1, 4, 5>
4. Cycle <0, 8, 1, 7, 5>
5. Cycle <1, 9, 2, 7, 5>
6. Cycle <1, 9, 6, 5, 4>
7. Cycle <1, 9, 6, 0, 8>
8. Cycle <2, 9, 6, 5, 4>
9. Cycle <2, 9, 1, 7, 5>
10. Cycle <3, 7, 5, 4, 1>
11. Cycle <3, 7, 5, 6, 0>
12. Cycle <3, 7, 0, 8, 1>
13. Cycle <4, 5, 6, 9, 2>
14. Cycle <4, 5, 1, 9, 2>
15. Cycle <5, 6, 9, 2, 7>
16. Cycle <5, 6, 0, 8, 7>
17. Cycle <5, 1, 7, 8, 0>

Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycles: 
1. <0, 8, 1, 4, 5> (Chord: (4, 1))
2. <0, 8, 1, 7, 5> (Chord: (8, 5))
3. <1, 9, 6, 0, 8> (Chord: (9, 0))
4. <2, 9, 1, 7, 5> (Chord: (9, 7))

Step 3:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]
