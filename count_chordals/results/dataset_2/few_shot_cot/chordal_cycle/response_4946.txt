Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <6, (16, 14), 11, (14, 18)>.

Following the steps provided, we can count the number of chordless cycles:
Step 1: Identify all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: 6 - 9 - 4 - 5 - 6
- Cycle 2: 6 - 14 - 11 - 14 - 6
- Cycle 3: 8 - 5 - 18 - 1 - 8
- Cycle 4: 16 - 6 - 14 - 18 - 16
- Cycle 5: 16 - 6 - 9 - 4 - 16
- Cycle 6: 18 - 14 - 11 - 6 - 18

Step 2: Check for each cycle if it has exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has two chords: (16, 14).
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (14, 18).
- Cycle 5 has no chords.
- Cycle 6 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
Only Cycle 3 is chordless, therefore the number of chordless cycles is [1].
