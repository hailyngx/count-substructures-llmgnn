Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 5) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of 4 or more nodes: 
- Cycle <0, 6, 1, 3, 9, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle <0, 6, 1, 3, 2, 9, 4, 0>
- Cycle <0, 6, 1, 2, 3, 9, 4, 0>
- Cycle <0, 7, 8, 9, 4, 0, 6, 5>
- Cycle <1, 3, 9, 8, 7, 5, 6, 0>
- Cycle <1, 3, 2, 9, 4, 8, 7, 5>
- Cycle <1, 2, 4, 9, 8, 7, 5, 6>
- Cycle <5, 6, 0, 4, 9, 8, 7, 5> 

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle <0, 6, 1, 3, 9, 8, 4, 0> has one chord: (3, 8)
- Cycle <0, 6, 1, 3, 2, 9, 4, 0> has one chord: (1, 9)
- Cycle <1, 3, 2, 9, 4, 8, 7, 5> has one chord: (3, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
- <0, 6, 1, 3, 9, 8, 4, 0>
- <0, 6, 1, 3, 2, 9, 4, 0>
- <1, 3, 2, 9, 4, 8, 7, 5>
