Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 16, 11, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 16, 13, 18>
- Cycle 3: <0, 16, 9, 12>
- Cycle 4: <0, 16, 11, 4>
- Cycle 5: <0, 7, 19, 5>
- Cycle 6: <0, 7, 15, 10>
- Cycle 7: <0, 10, 8, 13>
- Cycle 8: <1, 8, 19, 7>
- Cycle 9: <1, 8, 13, 16>
- Cycle 10: <1, 8, 3, 5>
- Cycle 11: <1, 8, 10, 15>
- Cycle 12: <1, 6, 14, 10>
- Cycle 13: <1, 6, 14, 10>
- Cycle 14: <1, 14, 10, 17>
- Cycle 15: <1, 12, 4, 11>
- Cycle 16: <3, 8, 10, 15>
- Cycle 17: <3, 8, 19, 5>
- Cycle 18: <5, 11, 16, 13>
- Cycle 19: <5, 19, 7, 15>
- Cycle 20: <5, 13, 16, 9>
- Cycle 21: <7, 15, 10, 17>
- Cycle 22: <7, 19, 5, 13>
- Cycle 23: <12, 9, 16, 13>
- Cycle 24: <12, 9, 16, 11>
- Cycle 25: <12, 1, 6, 14>
- Cycle 26: <13, 16, 9, 12>
- Cycle 27: <13, 16, 11, 4>
- Cycle 28: <13, 18, 15, 10>
- Cycle 29: <14, 1, 8, 3>
- Cycle 30: <14, 1, 12, 4>
- Cycle 31: <15, 10, 14, 1>
- Cycle 32: <15, 10, 17, 7>
- Cycle 33: <16, 13, 8, 3>
- Cycle 34: <16, 13, 18, 15>
- Cycle 35: <17, 15, 10, 14>
- Cycle 36: <18, 15, 10, 14>
- Cycle 37: <19, 7, 15, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <0, 16, 9, 12> with chord (9, 12)
- <1, 6, 14, 10> with chord (6, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 35 chordless cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
