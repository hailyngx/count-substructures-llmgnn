Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <1, 6, 2, 14, 19, 4, 17, 13>
- Cycle 2: <1, 6, 18, 3, 10, 19, 14, 5>
- Cycle 3: <1, 6, 18, 3, 13, 17, 11, 16>
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 12, 8, 0, 10, 4, 17>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 12, 8, 0, 19, 14, 2>
- Cycle 6: <1, 18, 3, 10, 0, 8, 12, 6>
- Cycle 7: <1, 18, 3, 13, 17, 4, 9, 7>
- Cycle 8: <2, 14, 19, 4, 17, 13, 15, 5>
- Cycle 9: <2, 14, 19, 10, 0, 8, 12, 5>
- Cycle 10: <3, 18, 6, 12, 8, 0, 10, 4>
- Cycle 11: <3, 18, 6, 12, 5, 15, 13, 17>
- Cycle 12: <4, 17, 13, 15, 5, 12, 8, 10>
- Cycle 13: <4, 17, 13, 15, 5, 14, 19, 10>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chords (6, 14).
- Cycle 6 has chords (6, 8).
- Cycle 9 has chords (12, 8).
- Cycle 10 has chords (18, 12).
- Cycle 11 has chords (6, 12).
- Cycle 15 has chords (17, 3).
- Cycle 16 has chords (17, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, 6, 2, 14, 19, 4, 17, 13>
<1, 18, 3, 10, 0, 8, 12, 6>
<2, 14, 19, 4, 17, 13, 15, 5>
<3, 18, 6, 12, 8, 0, 10, 4>
<4, 17, 13, 15, 5, 12, 8, 10>
<4, 17, 13, 3, 10, 0, 19, 14>
<5, 12, 8, 10, 0, 19, 14, 2>
