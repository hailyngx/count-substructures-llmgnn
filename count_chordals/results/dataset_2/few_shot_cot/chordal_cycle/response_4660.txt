- Cycle 38: (8, 6, 4, 9, 8)
- Cycle 39: (8, 6, 4, 3, 8)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (2, 5), 9, 3> has one chord (2, 5)
- <3, (4, 6), 9, 5> has one chord (4, 6)
- <1, 5, 9, (2, 6)> has one chord (2, 6)
- <2, 5, (1, 7), 9> has one chord (1, 7)
- <6, (9, 5), 2, 8> has one chord (9, 5)
- <3, 9, 5, (2, 6)> has one chord (2, 6)
- <8, (9, 4), 6, 5> has one chord (9, 4)
- <5, (1, 7), 3, 9> has one chord (1, 7)
- <8, 6, 4, (9, 3)> has one chord (9, 3)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the answer is [9].
