Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle 0-20-25-12-1-3-24
2. Cycle 0-20-25-12-16-17-4-6
3. Cycle 0-20-25-8-2-6-4-17
4. Cycle 0-20-29-5-18-13-9
5. Cycle 0-20-29-17-16-26-21-3
6. Cycle 0-20-29-17-4-6-2-8
7. Cycle 1-3-24-12-16-17-4-6
8. Cycle 1-3-24-12-25-20-29-5
9. Cycle 1-11-10-27-21-3-24
10. Cycle 1-11-22-27-19-25-20-0
11. Cycle 2-8-25-20-29-17-4-6
12. Cycle 3-7-14-7
13. Cycle 3-21-26-16-17-4-6
14. Cycle 4-6-2-8-25-20-0
15. Cycle 5-18-9-13-18-23-10-11
16. Cycle 5-29-20-25-8-2-6-4
17. Cycle 8-2-6-4-17-16-12-1
18. Cycle 8-2-6-4-17-29-20-25
19. Cycle 10-11-26-21-27-22-11
20. Cycle 10-11-26-16-17-4-6-0
21. Cycle 12-24-3-21-27-19-15-17
22. Cycle 15-17-16-26-21-27-19-15

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 0-20-25-12-1-3-24 -> Chord: (1, 24)
2. Cycle 0-20-25-12-16-17-4-6 -> Chord: (16, 4)
3. Cycle 1-3-24-12-16-17-4-6 -> Chord: (16, 4)
4. Cycle 5-18-9-13-18-23-10-11 -> Chord: (10, 13)

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
<0, 1, 24, 25>
<0, 4, 6, 16>
<1, 3, 4, 6>
<5, 9, 10, 13>
