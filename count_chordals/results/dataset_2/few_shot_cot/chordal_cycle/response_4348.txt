Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 4, 6, 7>
- <0, 4, 9, 5>
- <0, 1, 5, 7>
- <2, 5, 9, 3>
- <2, 5, 8, 3>
- <2, 6, 7, 4>
- <3, 6, 7, 4>
- <3, 8, 5, 9>
- <4, 6, 7, 5>
- <4, 7, 5, 9>
- <5, 1, 0, 4>
- <5, 7, 6, 4>
- <6, 2, 8, 5>
- <6, 7, 5, 9>
- <8, 2, 5, 1>
- <8, 3, 9, 5>
- <9, 3, 8, 5>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, 4, (6, 7), 7>
- <0, 4, (9, 5), 5>
- <0, 1, (5, 7), 7>
- <2, 5, (9, 3), 3>
- <2, 5, (8, 3), 3>
- <2, 6, (7, 4), 4>
- <3, 6, (7, 4), 4>
- <3, 8, (5, 9), 9>
- <4, 6, (7, 5), 5>
- <4, 7, (5, 9), 9>
- <5, 1, (0, 4), 4>
- <5, 7, (6, 4), 4>
- <6, 2, (8, 5), 5>
- <6, 7, (5, 9), 9>
- <8, 2, (5, 1), 1>
- <8, 3, (9, 5), 5>
- <9, 3, (8, 5), 5>

Step 3:
There are 17 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [17].
