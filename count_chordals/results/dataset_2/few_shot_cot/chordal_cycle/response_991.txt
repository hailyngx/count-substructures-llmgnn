Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 8, 1, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 3, 4, 0, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 1, 2, 14, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 10, 8, 14, 5)
- Cycle 5: (5, 2, 0, 4, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 8, 11, 2, 5)
- Cycle 7: (5, 3, 4, 11, 9, 5)
- Cycle 8: (5, 1, 2, 11, 9, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 10, 12, 9, 5)
- Cycle 10: (5, 2, 6, 12, 9, 5)
- Cycle 11: (5, 8, 11, 4, 0, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 8, 14, 10, 12, 9, 5)
- Cycle 13: (5, 10, 12, 6, 14, 8, 5)
- Cycle 14: (5, 2, 0, 14, 8, 11, 5)
- Cycle 15: (5, 10, 12, 6, 7, 13, 5)
  
Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <<5, 8, 1, 5>, (8, 1)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <<5, 1, 2, 14, 5>, (1, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <<5, 10, 8, 14, 5>, (10, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <<5, 2, 6, 12, 9, 5>, (2, 12)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <<5, 8, 14, 10, 12, 9, 5>, (8, 10)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <<5, 2, 0, 14, 8, 11, 5>, (2, 11)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles: [6]
