Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <5, 11, 18, 16>
- Cycle 2: <7, 12, 16, 18>
- Cycle 3: <8, 5, 11, 18>
- Cycle 4: <12, 16, 18, 19>
- Cycle 5: <14, 8, 5, 15>

Step 2: Checking for chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <5, 11, 18, 16> has a chord 11
- Cycle 2: <7, 12, 16, 18> has a chord 12
- Cycle 3: <8, 5, 11, 18> has a chord 8
- Cycle 4: <12, 16, 18, 19> has a chord 16
- Cycle 5: <14, 8, 5, 15> has a chord 8

Step 3: Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles:
Since all cycles have exactly 1 chord each, there are a total of [5] unique chordal 4-cycles:

<5, 11, 18, 16>
<7, 12, 16, 18>
<8, 5, 11, 18>
<12, 16, 18, 19>
<14, 8, 5, 15>
