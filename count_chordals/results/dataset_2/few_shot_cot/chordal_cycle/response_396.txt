Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <5, 1, 4, 6, 5>
2. <5, 1, 7, 6, 5>
3. <5, 7, 6, 9, 5>
4. <9, 6, 7, 5, 9>
5. <9, 6, 3, 1, 9>
6. <9, 3, 1, 5, 9>
7. <6, 5, 1, 3, 6>
8. <6, 5, 7, 4, 6>
9. <6, 7, 4, 1, 6>
10. <6, 7, 1, 5, 6>
11. <6, 4, 1, 3, 6>
12. <6, 4, 7, 5, 6>
13. <6, 3, 1, 4, 6>
14. <1, 5, 7, 4, 1>
15. <1, 7, 5, 6, 1>
16. <1, 7, 6, 3, 1>
17. <1, 4, 6, 5, 1>
18. <1, 4, 0, 3, 1>
19. <1, 3, 6, 5, 1>
20. <1, 3, 9, 6, 1>
21. <3, 9, 8, 0, 3>
22. <3, 9, 6, 4, 3>
23. <3, 9, 6, 1, 3>
24. <3, 0, 1, 4, 3>
25. <3, 0, 9, 6, 3>
26. <4, 1, 7, 6, 4>
27. <4, 1, 5, 6, 4>
28. <4, 1, 0, 3, 4>
29. <4, 7, 5, 6, 4>
30. <4, 7, 1, 3, 4>
31. <4, 0, 1, 5, 4>
32. <4, 0, 3, 6, 4>
33. <7, 5, 6, 9, 7>
34. <7, 5, 1, 4, 7>
35. <7, 6, 9, 8, 7>
36. <7, 6, 5, 1, 7>
37. <7, 6, 3, 1, 7>
38. <8, 9, 6, 5, 8>
39. <8, 9, 3, 1, 8>
40. <8, 2, 6, 5, 8>
  
Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
<5, 1, 4, 6, 5> with chord (1, 4)
<6, 5, 7, 1, 6> with chord (5, 7)
<6, 3, 1, 9, 6> with chord (3, 9)
<6, 1, 7, 5, 6> with chord (1, 7)
<3, 9, 6, 4, 3> with chord (6, 4)
<1, 7, 5, 6, 1> with chord (7, 5)
<4, 1, 7, 6, 4> with chord (1, 7)
<7, 6, 5, 1, 7> with chord (6, 5)
<8, 9, 6, 5, 8> with chord (9, 6)

Step 3:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
