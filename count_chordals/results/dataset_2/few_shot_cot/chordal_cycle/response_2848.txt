Response:
Step 1: 
There are 10 cycles of length 4 or more in this graph: 
1. Cycle: <0, 14, 1, 15, 3, 10, 0>
2. Cycle: <0, 14, 1, 17, 16, 9, 5, 18, 11, 13, 0>
3. Cycle: <1, 15, 3, 6, 17, 16, 11, 18, 5, 9, 1>
4. Cycle: <2, 8, 3, 6, 17, 16, 9, 5, 4, 11, 13, 2>
5. Cycle: <3, 8, 2, 12, 2, 6, 11, 13, 14, 0, 17, 16, 9, 10, 3>
6. Cycle: <3, 9, 5, 4, 6, 11, 18, 5, 9, 10, 3>
7. Cycle: <3, 9, 16, 11, 6, 17, 0, 14, 13, 11, 18, 5, 9, 3>
8. Cycle: <4, 5, 9, 16, 17, 6, 3, 10, 0, 14, 13, 11, 4>
9. Cycle: <4, 6, 11, 13, 14, 0, 10, 15, 1, 17, 16, 9, 5, 4>
10. Cycle: <6, 11, 18, 5, 9, 3, 15, 1, 14, 13, 11, 6>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, only the cycle <1, 15, 3, 10, 0> has exactly one chord: edge (15, 10). This is a unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph.

Step 3:
The final number of chordless cycles: [9]
