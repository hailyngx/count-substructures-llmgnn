54. <14, 8, 7, 10, 14>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
1. <0, 4, 6, 8, (0, 6)>
2. <1, 4, 11, 14, (1, 11)>
3. <2, 6, 3, 11, (2, 11)>
4. <3, 6, 8, 10, (3, 8)>
5. <4, 9, 11, 12, (4, 11)>
6. <5, 7, 10, 13, (5, 10)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [48].
