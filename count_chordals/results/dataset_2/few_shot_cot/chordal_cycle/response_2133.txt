Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
1. Cycle 1: (0, 5, 2, 8)
2. Cycle 2: (0, 5, 2, 4)
3. Cycle 3: (0, 1, 5, 2)
4. Cycle 4: (0, 1, 8, 9)
5. Cycle 5: (1, 5, 2, 4)
6. Cycle 6: (1, 8, 9, 4)
7. Cycle 7: (2, 5, 7, 8)
8. Cycle 8: (2, 5, 3, 4)
9. Cycle 9: (2, 6, 4, 9)
10. Cycle 10: (3, 5, 2, 4)
11. Cycle 11: (3, 4, 9, 8)
12. Cycle 12: (4, 9, 8, 0)
13. Cycle 13: (4, 6, 7, 5)

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, we find that Cycle 4: (0, 1, 8, 9) has exactly one chord, which is the edge (1, 8). Therefore, this is a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 1, 9, 8>
