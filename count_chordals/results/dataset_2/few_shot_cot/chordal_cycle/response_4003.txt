Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <10, (5, 7), 3>.

Following the steps provided:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 10-5-2-12-10
- Cycle 2: 10-5-11-14-10
- Cycle 3: 10-4-14-11-10
- Cycle 4: 10-4-12-2-10
- Cycle 5: 10-3-8-1-10
- Cycle 6: 10-3-9-6-10
- Cycle 7: 10-3-4-12-10

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle.
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has no chord.
- Cycle 6 has no chord.
- Cycle 7 has a unique chord (5, 7).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 6.

So, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
