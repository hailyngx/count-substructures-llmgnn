Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 2) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 2) (0, 4) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 9, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 1, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 4, 8, 5>
<0, 4, 8, 2>
<0, 4, 3, 9>
<0, 9, 7, 5>
<0, 9, 7, 3>
<0, 9, 1, 3>
<4, 3, 9, 8>
<3, 9, 1, 2>
<3, 1, 2, 8>
<7, 9, 1, 3>
<7, 9, 3, 4>
<6, 9, 7, 5>
<2, 8, 5, 7>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0, 4, 8, 5> - Chord: (4, 8)
<0, 4, 8, 2> - Chord: (4, 8)
<0, 4, 3, 9> - Chord: (4, 9)
<0, 9, 7, 5> - Chord: (9, 7)
<0, 9, 7, 3> - Chord: (9, 7)
<0, 9, 1, 3> - Chord: (9, 1)
<4, 3, 9, 8> - Chord: (3, 9)
<3, 9, 1, 2> - Chord: (9, 1)
<3, 1, 2, 8> - Chord: (1, 2)
<7, 9, 1, 3> - Chord: (9, 1)
<7, 9, 3, 4> - Chord: (9, 3)
<6, 9, 7, 5> - Chord: (9, 7)
<2, 8, 5, 7> - Chord: (8, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
[0] (no chordal 4-cycles found)
