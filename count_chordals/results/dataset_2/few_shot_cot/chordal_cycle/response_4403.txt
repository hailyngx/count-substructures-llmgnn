Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 4, 11, 7, 2)
- Cycle 2: (20, 25, 5, 13, 16, 6, 29, 8, 22, 21, 26)
- Cycle 3: (20, 25, 5, 13, 10, 28, 17, 14, 23, 11)
- Cycle 4: (25, 5, 13, 16, 27, 26, 21, 18, 11, 24, 1)
- Cycle 5: (25, 10, 2, 7, 11, 18, 21, 26, 12, 0)
- Cycle 6: (27, 16, 6, 29, 22, 8, 20, 28, 17, 9)
- Cycle 7: (27, 10, 2, 0, 12, 26, 21, 18, 11, 24)
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 4, 11, 7, 2) <15, (4, 11)>
- Cycle 2: (20, 25, 5, 13, 16, 6, 29, 8, 22, 21, 26) <25, (5, 13)>
- Cycle 3: (20, 25, 5, 13, 10, 28, 17, 14, 23, 11) <20, (25, 5)>
- Cycle 4: (25, 5, 13, 16, 27, 26, 21, 18, 11, 24, 1) <25, (5, 13)>
- Cycle 5: (25, 10, 2, 7, 11, 18, 21, 26, 12, 0) <25, (10, 2)>
- Cycle 6: (27, 16, 6, 29, 22, 8, 20, 28, 17, 9) - No chord
- Cycle 7: (27, 10, 2, 0, 12, 26, 21, 18, 11, 24) <27, (10, 2)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
1. <3, 15, 4, 11, 7, 2>
2. <20, 25, 5, 13, 16, 27, 26>
3. <27, 16, 6, 29, 22, 8, 20, 28, 17, 9>
4. <27, 10, 2, 0, 12, 26, 21, 18, 11, 24>
