Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 8, 1)
- Cycle 2: (3, 5, 7, 3)
- Cycle 3: (3, 8, 2, 3)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 8, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 6: (5, 7, 8, 5)
- Cycle 7: (9, 5, 7, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

Out of the listed cycles, Cycle 4: (4, 7, 8, 4) has exactly one chord which is (7, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are [6] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <4, (7, 8), 4>
