Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (7, 12) (7, 11) (7, 19) (12, 7) (12, 4) (12, 13) (12, 17) (12, 9) (4, 12) (4, 18) (4, 0) (4, 6) (18, 4) (18, 9) (18, 10) (3, 11) (3, 5) (3, 8) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 15) (0, 4) (0, 2) (16, 17) (16, 13) (16, 8) (16, 19) (9, 12) (9, 18) (9, 14) (1, 2) (1, 5) (19, 7) (19, 16) (19, 17) (5, 3) (5, 1) (8, 3) (8, 16) (8, 10) (6, 4) (14, 9) (14, 15) (14, 2) (17, 12) (17, 16) (17, 19) (17, 15) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 14) (2, 10) (15, 11) (15, 14) (15, 17) (13, 12) (13, 16) (10, 18) (10, 8) (10, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 0, 1, 14, and node 10
Node 3 is connected to node 11, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 12, 18, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 3, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 12, 11, and node 19
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 16, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 12, 18, and node 14
Node 10 is connected to node 18, 8, and node 2
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 15
Node 12 is connected to node 7, 4, 13, 17, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 12, and node 16
Node 14 is connected to node 9, 15, and node 2
Node 15 is connected to node 11, 14, and node 17
Node 16 is connected to node 17, 13, 8, and node 19
Node 17 is connected to node 12, 16, 19, and node 15
Node 18 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 10
Node 19 is connected to node 7, 16, and node 17

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph are as follows:
<12, (9, 17), 4, 18)>
<17, (15, 12), 7, 19)>
<9, (12, 15), 11, 7)>

Since each of these 4-cycles has exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
