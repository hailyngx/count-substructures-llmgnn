- <0, 4, 9, 19, 6, 5> has chord (9, 6)
- <0, 4, 11, 7, 3, 1> has chord (4, 7)
- <0, 4, 16, 14, 3, 1> has chord (4, 3)
- <0, 4, 16, 18, 15, 9> has chord (4, 15)
- <0, 10, 8, 12, 6, 5> has chord (8, 6)
- <0, 2, 19, 9, 15, 17> has chord (9, 15)
- <1, 3, 7, 17, 13, 2> has chord (3, 13)
- <1, 3, 14, 16, 4, 0> has chord (16, 0)
- <4, 9, 19, 6, 12, 8> has chord (6, 8)
- <5, 6, 15, 9, 4, 0> has chord (9, 0)
