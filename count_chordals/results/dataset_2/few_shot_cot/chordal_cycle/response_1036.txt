Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 16>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 1, 16>
- Cycle 3: <0, 8, 16, 11>
- Cycle 4: <0, 19, 13, 4>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 0, 7>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 0, 8>
- Cycle 7: <1, 2, 9, 11>
- Cycle 8: <2, 9, 8, 16>
- Cycle 9: <2, 12, 19, 13>
- Cycle 10: <3, 8, 16, 11>
- Cycle 11: <4, 13, 19, 12>
- Cycle 12: <4, 13, 3, 8>
- Cycle 13: <4, 17, 15, 13>
- Cycle 14: <5, 11, 9, 10>
- Cycle 15: <6, 0, 8, 16>
- Cycle 16: <6, 14, 10, 16>
- Cycle 17: <7, 0, 8, 16>
- Cycle 18: <9, 11, 16, 10>
- Cycle 19: <9, 10, 14, 11>
  
Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <0, 6, 1, 16>, chord: (7, 8)
- <0, 8, 16, 11>, chord: (0, 9)

Step 3:
There are 2 chordless 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [2].
