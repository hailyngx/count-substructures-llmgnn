Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <0, 4, 12, 8, 5>
2. <0, 4, 12, 14, 10>
3. <0, 4, 13, 10, 14>
4. <0, 11, 6, 5, 12>
5. <0, 11, 14, 10, 13>
6. <0, 12, 8, 6, 9>
7. <1, 6, 5, 12, 4>
8. <1, 6, 9, 10, 13>
9. <1, 6, 9, 7, 2>
10. <1, 9, 10, 13, 4>
11. <2, 6, 5, 12, 8>
12. <2, 6, 9, 10, 13>
13. <3, 4, 12, 14, 11>
14. <3, 4, 13, 10, 9>
15. <3, 11, 6, 5, 12>
16. <4, 12, 14, 11, 3>
17. <5, 6, 9, 7, 2>
18. <5, 8, 12, 14, 11>
19. <6, 9, 10, 13, 4>
20. <9, 10, 13, 3, 11>
21. <10, 13, 4, 12, 8>
22. <11, 14, 10, 13, 3>
23. <12, 14, 11, 3, 4>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <0, 4, 12, 8, 5> has chord (8, 12)
2. <0, 4, 12, 14, 10> has chord (12, 14)
3. <0, 4, 13, 10, 14> has chord (13, 10)
4. <0, 11, 6, 5, 12> has chord (11, 6)
5. <1, 6, 5, 12, 4> has chord (6, 12)
6. <1, 6, 9, 7, 2> has chord (6, 9)
7. <1, 9, 10, 13, 4> has chord (1, 13)
8. <3, 11, 6, 5, 12> has chord (11, 5)
9. <5, 6, 9, 7, 2> has chord (5, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found = [9]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<0, 4, 12, 8, 5>
<0, 4, 12, 14, 10>
<0, 4, 13, 10, 14>
<0, 11, 6, 5, 12>
<1, 6, 5, 12, 4>
<1, 6, 9, 7, 2>
<1, 9, 10, 13, 4>
<3, 11, 6, 5, 12>
<5, 6, 9, 7, 2>
