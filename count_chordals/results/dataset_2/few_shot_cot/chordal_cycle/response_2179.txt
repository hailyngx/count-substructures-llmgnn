Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <5, 3, 4, 6>
- <14, 16, 18, 6>
- <7, 1, 10, 9>
- <0, 14, 11, 13>
- <17, 11, 13, 15>

Step 2: Checking for chords:
- <5, 3, 4, 6>: Chord (3, 6)
- <14, 16, 18, 6>: Chord (14, 18)
- <7, 1, 10, 9>: Chord (1, 10)
- <0, 14, 11, 13>: Chord (0, 11)
- <17, 11, 13, 15>: No Chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, 3, 4, 6> (Chord: (3, 6))
- <14, 16, 18, 6> (Chord: (14, 18))
- <7, 1, 10, 9> (Chord: (1, 10))
- <0, 14, 11, 13> (Chord: (0, 11))
