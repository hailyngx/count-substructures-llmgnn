Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, but not all of them have every edge existing. For example, the cycle <1, 5, 12, 1> is not valid since the edge (1, 12) does not exist. 
Valid cycles are:
- <1, 7, 11, 1>
- <1, 7, 11, 3>
- <1, 7, 11, 3, 13>
- <1, 7, 11, 3, 19, 12>
- <1, 10, 15, 10>
- <1, 10, 15, 10, 13>
- <1, 10, 13, 3>
- <1, 10, 13, 19, 12>
- <1, 11, 3, 13>
- <1, 11, 3, 19, 12>
- <2, 8, 3, 11>
- <2, 8, 3, 13>
- <2, 5, 12, 19>
- <3, 11, 7, 1>
- <3, 11, 7, 1, 12>
- <3, 8, 2, 16>
- <3, 8, 6, 14>
- <3, 13, 10, 15>
- <3, 13, 10, 1>
- <3, 13, 19, 17>
- <3, 19, 12, 1>
- <3, 19, 12, 5>
- <3, 19, 17, 18>
- <4, 16, 2, 8>
- <4, 16, 0, 9>
- <4, 16, 0, 1>
- <4, 17, 18, 9>
- <5, 2, 8, 3>
- <5, 2, 8, 6>
- <5, 2, 16, 0>
- <5, 12, 6, 14>
- <5, 14, 6, 8>
- <6, 8, 3, 11>
- <6, 8, 3, 13>
- <6, 12, 19, 17>
- <7, 11, 3, 13>
- <9, 2, 8, 3>
- <9, 2, 16, 4>
- <10, 15, 10, 13>
- <10, 13, 19, 17>
- <11, 3, 13, 19>
- <12, 5, 2, 16>
- <13, 10, 1, 7>
- <13, 10, 15, 10>
- <13, 19, 12, 5>
- <17, 4, 16, 0>
- <17, 4, 16, 2>
- <18, 9, 0, 16>
- <18, 17, 19, 12>
- <19, 3, 8, 2>
- <19, 3, 13, 10>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are: 
- <1, 7, 11, 3, 13>
- <1, 10, 15, 10, 13>
- <3, 8, 2, 16>
- <4, 17, 18, 9>

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [4].
