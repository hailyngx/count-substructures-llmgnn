Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 13) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 14) (3, 13) (3, 12) (10, 11) (10, 4) (10, 13) (11, 10) (11, 12) (11, 4) (2, 6) (2, 14) (2, 4) (8, 9) (8, 12) (8, 7) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 0) (5, 7) (13, 9) (13, 3) (13, 10) (13, 5) (13, 14) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 14) (14, 3) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 7) (14, 12) (12, 3) (12, 11) (12, 8) (12, 5) (12, 14) (4, 1) (4, 10) (4, 11) (4, 2) (4, 0)

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <1, 3, 6, 9>. 
After checking for exactly one chord in each cycle, we find that this cycle has a chord between nodes 3 and 9. 
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles in the graph is [0].
