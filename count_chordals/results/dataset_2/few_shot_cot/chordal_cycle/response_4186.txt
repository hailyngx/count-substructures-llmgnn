- Cycle 23: <2, 9, 7, 4, 2>
- Cycle 24: <2, 9, 1, 3, 2>
- Cycle 25: <2, 7, 4, 6, 2>
- Cycle 26: <2, 1, 4, 8, 2>
- Cycle 27: <2, 1, 3, 8, 2>
- Cycle 28: <3, 1, 4, 6, 3>
- Cycle 29: <3, 1, 4, 8, 3>
- Cycle 30: <3, 2, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle 31: <4, 1, 9, 7, 4>
- Cycle 32: <4, 1, 7, 2, 4>
- Cycle 33: <4, 1, 3, 2, 4>
- Cycle 34: <4, 8, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle 35: <4, 8, 6, 2, 4>
- Cycle 36: <4, 7, 2, 9, 4>
- Cycle 37: <5, 9, 7, 4, 5>
- Cycle 38: <6, 4, 7, 2, 6>
- Cycle 39: <6, 4, 8, 3, 6>
- Cycle 40: <6, 2, 1, 9, 6>
- Cycle 41: <7, 9, 1, 3, 7>
- Cycle 42: <7, 9, 4, 6, 7>
- Cycle 43: <7, 4, 8, 3, 7>
- Cycle 44: <8, 9, 1, 3, 8>
- Cycle 45: <8, 9, 2, 7, 8>

- Cycle 47: <8, 4, 1, 9, 8>
- Cycle 48: <8, 4, 6, 2, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 9, 1, 4, 0> (Chord: 1, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <7, 9, 1, 3, 7> (Chord: 1, 3)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <8, 9, 1, 3, 8> (Chord: 1, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There are 45 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [3].
