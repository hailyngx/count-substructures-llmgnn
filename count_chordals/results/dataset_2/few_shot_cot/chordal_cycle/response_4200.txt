Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 9) (7, 5) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 0) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 9) (9, 7) (9, 2) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, 6, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 8, 6, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 5, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 5, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <4, 8, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle 3: <8, 3, 1, 6, 8>
- Cycle 4: <3, 1, 6, 5, 3>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 5, 2, 1>
- Cycle 6: <6, 5, 0, 4, 6>
- Cycle 7: <5, 0, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 8: <0, 4, 7, 9, 0>
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 9, 2, 4>
- Cycle 10: <7, 9, 2, 8, 7>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord <4, 8>
- Cycle 2 has a chord <8, 3>
- Cycle 3 has a chord <3, 1>
- Cycle 4 has a chord <6, 5>
- Cycle 5 has a chord <1, 6>
- Cycle 6 has a chord <5, 0>
- Cycle 7 has a chord <4, 7>
- Cycle 8 has a chord <0, 4>
- Cycle 9 has a chord <7, 9>
- Cycle 10 has a chord <9, 2>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
