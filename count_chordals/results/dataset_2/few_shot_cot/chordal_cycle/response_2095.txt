Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<5, 2, 10, 9>, <5, 2, 10, 1>, <5, 2, 9, 1>, <5, 9, 1, 13>, <5, 9, 1, 10>, <5, 9, 10, 2>, <9, 10, 2, 5>, <9, 10, 2, 1>, <9, 10, 1, 5>, <9, 10, 1, 13>, <10, 1, 9, 5>, <10, 1, 13, 4>, <10, 1, 13, 5>, <10, 1, 13, 9>, <1, 13, 4, 12>, <1, 13, 4, 5>, <1, 13, 5, 9>, <1, 13, 5, 4>, <1, 9, 5, 13>, <1, 9, 10, 2>, <1, 9, 10, 5>, <1, 9, 5, 13>, <1, 10, 2, 5>, <1, 10, 2, 9>, <1, 10, 9, 5>, <2, 5, 9, 10>, <2, 5, 10, 9>, <2, 9, 5, 13>, <2, 9, 10, 1>, <2, 9, 1, 5>, <3, 14, 4, 5>, <3, 14, 4, 13>, <3, 14, 13, 5>, <3, 14, 13, 4>, <3, 4, 12, 7>, <3, 4, 12, 14>, <3, 4, 14, 5>, <3, 4, 14, 13>, <4, 13, 5, 9>, <4, 13, 5, 1>, <4, 13, 1, 10>, <4, 13, 1, 5>, <4, 5, 9, 2>, <4, 5, 9, 13>, <4, 5, 13, 1>, <4, 5, 13, 9>, <5, 13, 1, 9>, <5, 13, 1, 4>, <5, 13, 4, 3>, <5, 13, 4, 1>, <9, 1, 10, 2>, <9, 1, 10, 5>, <9, 2, 10, 1>, <9, 2, 10, 5>, <10, 2, 5, 9>, <10, 2, 5, 13>, <10, 5, 13, 4>, <10, 5, 13, 1>, <11, 6, 14, 3>, <11, 6, 14, 12>, <11, 14, 3, 4>, <11, 14, 3, 12>, <12, 14, 4, 5>, <12, 14, 4, 13>, <12, 7, 11, 6>, <12, 7, 11, 14>, <13, 9, 1, 5>, <13, 9, 1, 10>, <13, 5, 4, 1>, <13, 5, 4, 12>, <14, 3, 4, 5>, <14, 3, 4, 13>, <14, 3, 12, 7>, <14, 3, 12, 6>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
<5, 2, 10, 1> - Chord (1, 10)
<5, 9, 1, 13> - Chord (1, 13)
<9, 10, 1, 5> - Chord (1, 5)
<9, 10, 1, 13> - Chord (1, 13)
<10, 1, 13, 4> - Chord (1, 13)
<1, 13, 4, 12> - Chord (4, 12)
<1, 13, 5, 9> - Chord (5, 9)
<1, 10, 2, 5> - Chord (2, 5)
<2, 5, 9, 10> - Chord (5, 10)
<3, 14, 4, 13> - Chord (4, 13)
<3, 4, 12, 7> - Chord (4, 12)
<4, 5, 9, 2> - Chord (9, 2)
<4, 5, 13, 1> - Chord (13, 1)
<11, 14, 3, 4> - Chord (3, 4)
<12, 7, 11, 6> - Chord (11, 6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
[14]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [14].
