Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 4) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 7, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
Here are the cycles found in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 5, 9, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 3, 9, 2, 8, 6, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 8, 9, 5, 7, 3, 0)
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 9, 8, 2, 4, 1)
- Cycle 5: (3, 4, 2, 9, 5, 7, 3)
- Cycle 6: (4, 6, 3, 7, 5, 9, 8, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has no chords.
- Cycle 5 has a chord (3, 5).
- Cycle 6 has no chords.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 4 chordless cycles found.
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <1, 5, 9, 8, 2, (4, 3), 1>
