- Cycle 4: 6 - 9 - 17 - 17 - 6 (Invalid, duplicate node)
- Cycle 5: 6 - 9 - 17 - 3 - 19 - 6
- Cycle 6: 6 - 10 - 2 - 15 - 6
- Cycle 7: 6 - 10 - 2 - 19 - 6

- Cycle 17: 1 - 18 - 9 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 18: 1 - 18 - 9 - 17 - 1
- Cycle 19: 1 - 15 - 2 - 10 - 1
- Cycle 20: 1 - 15 - 2 - 19 - 1
- Cycle 21: 1 - 15 - 12 - 15 - 1
- Cycle 22: 1 - 13 - 7 - 8 - 1
- Cycle 23: 1 - 13 - 16 - 0 - 1
