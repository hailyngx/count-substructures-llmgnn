Step 2: Identify chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal cycle <0, 12, 4, 5>
- Chordal cycle <2, 9, 19, 13>
- Chordal cycle <2, 9, 19, 17>
- Chordal cycle <9, 4, 17, 19>
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- 44 chordless 4-cycles were found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
