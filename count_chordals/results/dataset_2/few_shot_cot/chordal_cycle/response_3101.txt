Step 2: Checking for chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 4, 16, 11> - Chord: (4, 16)
<0, 4, 13, 6> - Chord: (4, 13)
<0, 12, 9, 3> - Chord: (12, 9)
<0, 12, 14, 19> - Chord: (12, 14)
<1, 8, 16, 15> - Chord: (8, 15)
<2, 6, 13, 17> - Chord: (6, 13)
<2, 6, 13, 8> - Chord: (6, 13)
<2, 9, 12, 14> - Chord: (9, 12)
<2, 5, 18, 15> - Chord: (5, 18)
<3, 9, 12, 0> - Chord: (9, 12)
<3, 17, 13, 8> - Chord: (13, 8)
<3, 7, 15, 16> - Chord: (7, 15)
<4, 16, 15, 8> - Chord: (16, 15)
<5, 18, 15, 7> - Chord: (15, 7)
<6, 13, 17, 3> - Chord: (13, 17)
<7, 3, 9, 12> - Chord: (3, 9)
<7, 15, 16, 11> - Chord: (15, 16)
<8, 11, 16, 15> - Chord: (11, 16)
<9, 12, 14, 19> - Chord: (12, 14)
<10, 19, 14, 12> - Chord: (14, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [19]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [19].
