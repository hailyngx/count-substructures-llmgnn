Response:
Step 1: 
    - There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. We will list them below: 
        1. <0, 5, 3, 4, 8> 
        2. <0, 5, 10, 9, 7>
        3. <1, 5, 3, 4, 8>
        4. <1, 5, 10, 9, 7>
        5. <2, 8, 4, 3, 11> 
        6. <2, 8, 14, 13, 12>
        7. <3, 4, 12, 11, 9> 
        8. <3, 4, 8, 2, 6>
        9. <4, 12, 13, 14, 8>
        10. <5, 3, 4, 8, 6>
        11. <6, 4, 8, 1, 5>
        12. <9, 7, 0, 5, 10>

Step 2: 
    - We will now check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        1. <0, 5, 3, 4, 8> (Chord: 3-8)
        2. <0, 5, 10, 9, 7> (Chord: 5-9)
        3. <1, 5, 3, 4, 8> (Chord: 5-8)
        4. <1, 5, 10, 9, 7> (Chord: 5-9)
        5. <2, 8, 4, 3, 11> (Chord: 4-11)
        6. <2, 8, 14, 13, 12> (Chord: 8-13)
        7. <3, 4, 12, 11, 9> (Chord: 4-11)
        8. <3, 4, 8, 2, 6> (Chord: 4-8)
        9. <4, 12, 13, 14, 8> (Chord: 12-14)
        10. <5, 3, 4, 8, 6> (Chord: 3-8)
        11. <6, 4, 8, 1, 5> (Chord: 4-5)
        12. <9, 7, 0, 5, 10> (Chord: 5-10)

Step 3:
    - Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we get [0].
