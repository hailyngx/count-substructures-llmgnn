Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 7) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 8, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 1, 9, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 1, 6, 3>
- Cycle 3: <1, 9, 5, 3, 6>
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 6, 3, 5>
- Cycle 5: <2, 5, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle 6: <3, 5, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle 7: <4, 9, 5, 3, 6>
- Cycle 8: <7, 0, 8, 4, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has the chord (1, 5)
- Cycle 2 has the chord (7, 1)
- Cycle 3 has the chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 4 has the chord (9, 5)
- Cycle 5 has the chord (2, 1)
- Cycle 6 has the chord (3, 5)
- Cycle 7 has the chord (4, 9)
- Cycle 8 has the chord (0, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:

There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final answer is [8].
