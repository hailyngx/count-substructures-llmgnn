Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 1) (3, 4) (3, 9) (3, 2) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 9) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 9) (8, 6) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 0) (5, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 5) (6, 7) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 9) (7, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 7) (2, 3) (2, 0) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 5, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 4, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 3, 8, 9, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in this graph. Let's list them:
- Cycle 1: <1, 3, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 3, 9, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 5, 6, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 7, 0, 1>
- Cycle 5: <3, 9, 7, 2, 3>
- Cycle 6: <4, 8, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 7: <4, 9, 7, 2, 4>
- Cycle 8: <5, 6, 8, 4, 5>
- Cycle 9: <5, 7, 0, 2, 5>
- Cycle 10: <6, 8, 4, 3, 6>
- Cycle 11: <7, 9, 3, 1, 7>
- Cycle 12: <0, 7, 9, 1, 0>
- Cycle 13: <2, 0, 4, 3, 2>

Step 2:
Let's check each cycle for a chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has a chord: <1, (0, 5), 1>
- Cycle 5 has a chord: <3, (7, 9), 3>
- Cycle 6 has a chord: <4, (6, 8), 4>
- Cycle 7 has no chord.
- Cycle 8 has a chord: <5, (4, 6), 5>
- Cycle 9 has a chord: <6, (0, 7), 6>
- Cycle 10 has a chord: <7, (3, 8), 7>
- Cycle 11 has no chord.
- Cycle 12 has no chord.
- Cycle 13 has no chord.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord, we have [5].

The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <1, (0, 5), 1>
- <3, (7, 9), 3>
- <4, (6, 8), 4>
- <5, (4, 6), 5>
- <6, (0, 7), 6>
