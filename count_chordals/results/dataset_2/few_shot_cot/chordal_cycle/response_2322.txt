- Cycle 3 has no chord
- Cycle 4 has no chord
- Cycle 5 has no chord
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (18, 13)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (10, 29)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (11, 28)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (24, 13)
- Cycle 10 has no chord
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (17, 2)
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (17, 10)
- Cycle 13 has one chord: (17, 23)
- Cycle 14 has one chord: (24, 6)
- Cycle 15 has no chord
- Cycle 16 has one chord: (17, 24)
- Cycle 17 has one chord: (26, 29)
- Cycle 18 has no chord
- Cycle 19 has one chord: (22, 28)
- Cycle 20 has one chord: (1, 15)
- Cycle 21 has one chord: (22, 28)
- Cycle 22 has no chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
