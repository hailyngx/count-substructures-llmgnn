Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 3, 1, 13, 12>
- <0, 3, 1, 4, 9>
- <0, 3, 14, 11, 8>
- <0, 3, 14, 4, 9>
- <0, 3, 8, 9, 6>
- <0, 3, 8, 10, 6>
- <0, 7, 2, 1, 13>
- <0, 7, 2, 11, 8>
- <0, 7, 5, 6, 9>
- <0, 7, 5, 12, 1>
- <0, 11, 8, 9, 6>
- <0, 11, 8, 10, 6>
- <0, 11, 14, 3, 1>
- <0, 11, 14, 4, 9>
- <0, 14, 3, 1, 13>
- <0, 14, 3, 8, 9>
- <0, 14, 11, 4, 9>
- <1, 3, 0, 7, 5>
- <1, 3, 8, 9, 6>
- <1, 3, 8, 10, 6>
- <1, 12, 5, 7, 0>
- <1, 12, 5, 6, 9>
- <2, 1, 3, 0, 11>
- <2, 1, 13, 9, 6>
- <2, 7, 0, 3, 8>
- <2, 7, 0, 11, 14>
- <2, 7, 5, 6, 9>
- <2, 11, 8, 9, 6>
- <4, 9, 6, 10, 8>
- <4, 11, 8, 10, 6>
- <5, 6, 9, 13, 12>
- <8, 9, 6, 5, 7>
- <13, 9, 6, 5, 7>
  
Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <0, 3, 1, 4, 9> (chord: 4-9)
- <0, 7, 2, 1, 13> (chord: 1-13)
- <1, 12, 5, 7, 0> (chord: 5-7)
- <2, 1, 13, 9, 6> (chord: 9-6)

Step 3: 
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
