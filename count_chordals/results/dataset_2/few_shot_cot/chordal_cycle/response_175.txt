Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 1
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are 4-cycles in the graph: 
    - Cycle 1: <0, 5, 8, 1, 0>
    - Cycle 2: <0, 5, 3, 9, 0>
    - Cycle 3: <0, 4, 9, 7, 0>
    - Cycle 4: <0, 1, 6, 5, 0>
    - Cycle 5: <5, 3, 9, 7, 5>
    - Cycle 6: <5, 8, 1, 6, 5>
    - Cycle 7: <7, 9, 4, 0, 7>
    - Cycle 8: <7, 4, 0, 5, 7>
    - Cycle 9: <9, 4, 7, 6, 9>
    - Cycle 10: <9, 3, 1, 6, 9>
    - Cycle 11: <5, 7, 2, 6, 5>
    - Cycle 12: <3, 1, 6, 2, 3>
    - Cycle 13: <0, 2, 7, 4, 0>
    - Cycle 14: <8, 1, 6, 7, 8>
    - Cycle 15: <7, 2, 0, 9, 7>

Step 2:
- From the above cycles, the cycles with exactly one chord are:
    - Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 5, 3, 9, 0> with chord (5, 9)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 2: <7, 4, 0, 5, 7> with chord (4, 5)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 3: <9, 4, 7, 6, 9> with chord (4, 7)
    - Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, 7, 2, 6, 5> with chord (7, 6)

Step 3:
- There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
