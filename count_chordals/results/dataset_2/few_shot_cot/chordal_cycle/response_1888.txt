Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:  
- Chordless cycle found: <0, 15, 7, 6, 4>  
- Chordless cycle found: <0, 14, 18, 26, 27>  
- Chordless cycle found: <0, 21, 26, 27, 22>  
- Chordless cycle found: <1, 3, 9, 4, 6>  
- Chordless cycle found: <2, 3, 4, 6, 7>  
- Chordless cycle found: <5, 20, 12, 1, 3>  
- Chordless cycle found: <7, 17, 21, 26, 27>  

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:  
There are 7 chordless cycles found, so the answer is [7].
