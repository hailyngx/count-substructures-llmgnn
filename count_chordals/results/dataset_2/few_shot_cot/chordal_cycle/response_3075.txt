Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 3) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 8) (2, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 0, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
1. Cycle <0, 4, 5, 7>
2. Cycle <0, 4, 3, 6>
3. Cycle <0, 3, 8, 1>
4. Cycle <2, 4, 3, 6>
5. Cycle <2, 3, 8, 1>
6. Cycle <4, 5, 7, 0>
7. Cycle <4, 7, 0, 2>
8. Cycle <5, 7, 0, 4>
9. Cycle <7, 5, 9, 1>
10. Cycle <8, 9, 2, 1>

Step 2:
Identifying the cycles with exactly one chord:
1. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 4, 3, 6>, Chord: (0, 3)
2. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 3, 8, 1>, Chord: (3, 1)
3. Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 4, 3, 6>, Chord: (4, 6)
4. Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 3, 8, 1>, Chord: (3, 8)

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles found = [6]
