Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph. After listing all cycles that contain all existing edges, we find the following cycles: 

<0, 15, 22, 28> 
<0, 15, 9, 5> 
<0, 15, 9, 13> 
<0, 15, 9, 24> 
<0, 15, 22, 27> 
<0, 28, 22, 15> 
<0, 28, 22, 27> 
<1, 25, 19, 18> 
<1, 25, 19, 18, 3> 
<1, 25, 19, 18, 11> 
...

Step 2:
From the above cycles, we find the following chordal 4-cycles (cycles with exactly one chord/edge connecting non-adjacent nodes):

<0, 15, 9, 13>
<0, 15, 9, 24>
<0, 15, 22, 28>
<0, 28, 22, 15>
<1, 25, 19, 18>
<1, 25, 19, 18, 3>
<1, 25, 19, 18, 11>
...

Step 3:
Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found, we get [50].
