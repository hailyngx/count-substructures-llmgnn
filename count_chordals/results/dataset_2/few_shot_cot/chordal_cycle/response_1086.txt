Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <0, 16, 2, 18> with a single chord (edge) 5.
Following the steps mentioned:
Step 1: Identify cycles of length 4 or more with all edges existing.
- Cycle <0, 16, 2, 18, 0>
- Cycle <0, 16, 14, 17, 4, 0>
Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle.
- Cycle <0, 16, 2, 18, 0> has one chord (5)
- Cycle <0, 16, 14, 17, 4, 0> does not have any chords.
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles, which is [1].
