Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

There are several cycles in the graph, but the unique cycles of length 4 are as follows:
1. Cycle 1: (6, 1, 2, 9)
2. Cycle 2: (4, 5, 12, 13)
3. Cycle 3: (7, 10, 11, 8)
4. Cycle 4: (0, 1, 2, 14)
5. Cycle 5: (3, 9, 11, 10)
6. Cycle 6: (4, 8, 11, 12)
7. Cycle 7: (5, 2, 9, 6)
8. Cycle 8: (0, 3, 13, 4)
9. Cycle 9: (0, 1, 6, 7)
10. Cycle 10: (2, 5, 14, 4)
11. Cycle 11: (2, 9, 3, 0)
12. Cycle 12: (2, 1, 0, 14)
13. Cycle 13: (4, 14, 2, 5)
14. Cycle 14: (5, 12, 10, 7)
15. Cycle 15: (12, 13, 3, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <6, 1, 2, 9> has a chord (2, 9) -> Chordal cycle: <6, (2, 9), 1>
- Cycle 2 <4, 5, 12, 13> has a chord (5, 12) -> Chordal cycle: <4, (5, 12), 13>
- Cycle 3 <7, 10, 11, 8> has a chord (10, 11) -> Chordal cycle: <7, (10, 11), 8>
- Cycle 4 <0, 1, 2, 14> has a chord (1, 14) -> Chordal cycle: <0, (1, 14), 2>
- Cycle 5 <3, 9, 11, 10> has a chord (9, 10) -> Chordal cycle: <3, (9, 10), 11>
- Cycle 6 <4, 8, 11, 12> has a chord (8, 11) -> Chordal cycle: <4, (8, 11), 12>
- Cycle 7 <5, 2, 9, 6> has a chord (2, 9) -> Chordal cycle: <5, (2, 9), 6>
- Cycle 9 <0, 1, 6, 7> has a chord (1, 6) -> Chordal cycle: <0, (1, 6), 7>
- Cycle 13 <4, 14, 2, 5> has a chord (14, 5) -> Chordal cycle: <4, (14, 5), 2>
- Cycle 14 <5, 12, 10, 7> has a chord (12, 7) -> Chordal cycle: <5, (12, 7), 10>
- Cycle 15 <12, 13, 3, 9> has a chord (13, 3) -> Chordal cycle: <12, (13, 3), 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found, which is 9.

Final answer: [9]
