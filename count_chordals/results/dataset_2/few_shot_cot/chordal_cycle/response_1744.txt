Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (7, 5) (7, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 1, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 5, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 5, 3, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 9, 5, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 3, 5, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 9, 5, 3, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 9, 8, 5, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 3, 5, 7, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 3, 6, 9, 2>
- Cycle 10: <2, 4, 5, 7, 2>
- Cycle 11: <2, 4, 3, 6, 2>
- Cycle 12: <2, 8, 5, 7, 2>
- Cycle 13: <2, 8, 1, 7, 2>
- Cycle 14: <3, 5, 9, 6, 3>
- Cycle 15: <3, 5, 7, 1, 3>
- Cycle 16: <3, 6, 9, 8, 3>
- Cycle 17: <3, 6, 0, 4, 3>
- Cycle 18: <3, 2, 4, 0, 3>
- Cycle 19: <4, 5, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle 20: <4, 5, 7, 1, 4>
- Cycle 21: <7, 5, 9, 6, 7>
- Cycle 22: <7, 5, 3, 2, 7>
- Cycle 23: <8, 5, 9, 6, 8>
- Cycle 24: <8, 5, 7, 1, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 9, 1, 8, 0> has chord (5,3)
- <0, 9, 5, 4, 0> has chord (3,6)
- <0, 9, 5, 3, 0> has chord (4,2)
- <0, 6, 9, 5, 0> has chord (3,8)
- <1, 9, 5, 3, 1> has chord (4,7)
- <2, 3, 5, 7, 2> has chord (0,8)
- <2, 4, 3, 6, 2> has chord (0,9)
- <2, 8, 1, 7, 2> has chord (3,5)
- <4, 5, 9, 6, 4> has chord (2,0)
- <7, 5, 9, 6, 7> has chord (1,3)
- <8, 5, 7, 1, 8> has chord (2,6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [14].
