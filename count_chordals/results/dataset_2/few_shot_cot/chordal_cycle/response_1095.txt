Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 1) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <5, 4, 9, 0>. 
I will now calculate the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <5, 4, 9, 0, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 4, 2, 0, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 2, 3, 6, 9, 4, 5>
- Cycle 4: <2, 0, 4, 8, 7, 1, 9, 6, 3, 2>
Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (5, 0)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (0, 2)
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [4]
