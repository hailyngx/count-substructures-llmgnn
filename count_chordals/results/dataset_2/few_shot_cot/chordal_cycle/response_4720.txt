Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, but we are interested in finding chordal 4-cycles specifically. 
After analyzing the graph, we find the following chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord:
<3, (15, 26), 5)>

Step 3:
Since we found one chordal 4-cycle in the graph, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
