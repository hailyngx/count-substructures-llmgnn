Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 28, 8, 13>
- Cycle 2: <0, 28, 7, 3>
- Cycle 3: <1, 24, 6, 17>
- Cycle 4: <1, 24, 29, 20>
- Cycle 5: <2, 20, 24, 6>
- Cycle 6: <3, 1, 24, 6>
- Cycle 7: <3, 1, 24, 29>
- Cycle 8: <4, 0, 28, 8>
- Cycle 9: <5, 17, 27, 12>
- Cycle 10: <6, 17, 27, 12>
- Cycle 11: <7, 28, 0, 4>
- Cycle 12: <7, 28, 0, 22>
- Cycle 13: <8, 13, 26, 10>
- Cycle 14: <10, 23, 9, 19>
- Cycle 15: <11, 29, 24, 1>
- Cycle 16: <14, 16, 19, 9>
- Cycle 17: <17, 6, 24, 1>
- Cycle 18: <18, 3, 7, 19>
- Cycle 19: <20, 29, 24, 1>
- Cycle 20: <21, 7, 3, 1>
- Cycle 21: <22, 4, 0, 28>
- Cycle 22: <27, 17, 6, 24>
- Cycle 23: <28, 0, 4, 22>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Chordal cycle 1: <0, 28, 8, 13>; Chord: (8, 13)
- Chordal cycle 2: <14, 16, 19, 9>; Chord: (16, 9)
- Chordal cycle 3: <17, 6, 24, 1>; Chord: (6, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Since there are 3 chordal cycles found, the number of chordless cycles is [20].
