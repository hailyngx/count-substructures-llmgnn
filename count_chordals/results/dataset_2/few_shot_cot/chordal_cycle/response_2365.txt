Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 2) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 0, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
Possible cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 4, 5, 3, 7>.
2. Cycle <0, 4, 8, 5, 3>.

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
1. Cycle <0, 4, 5, 3, 7> has a chord (4, 3).
2. Cycle <0, 4, 8, 5, 3> has a chord (4, 5).

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles found: [2].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, 4, 5, 3, 7>
<0, 4, 8, 5, 3>
