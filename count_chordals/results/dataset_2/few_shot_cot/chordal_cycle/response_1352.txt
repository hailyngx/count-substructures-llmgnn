Response:
Step 1: 
List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 6, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 5, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 8, 7>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 2, 9>
- Cycle 5: <0, 4, 1, 5>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 6, 3>
- Cycle 7: <1, 5, 6, 7>
- Cycle 8: <1, 8, 7, 6>
- Cycle 9: <2, 6, 7, 8>
- Cycle 10: <2, 8, 3, 5>
- Cycle 11: <2, 8, 7, 0>
- Cycle 12: <2, 9, 4, 1>
- Cycle 13: <3, 6, 7, 0>
- Cycle 14: <3, 8, 7, 0>
- Cycle 15: <4, 1, 5, 6>
- Cycle 16: <4, 9, 8, 7>
- Cycle 17: <5, 6, 3, 0>
- Cycle 18: <7, 6, 3, 8>
- Cycle 19: <8, 7, 0, 3>
- Cycle 20: <8, 9, 4, 0>

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles with one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 3, 6, 7>, Chord: (0, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 3, 5, 1>, Chord: (3, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 4, 1, 5>, Chord: (1, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, 8, 7, 0>, Chord: (2, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 9, 4, 1>, Chord: (1, 9)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
There are 15 chordless 4-cycles found. 

Therefore, the final number to be inside brackets is [15].
