- <6, 3, 13, 4> has chord (3, 13)
- <9, 4, 13, 6> has chord (4, 6)
- <9, 4, 11, 12> has chord (4, 11)
- <9, 14, 0, 6> has chord (14, 6)
- <9, 14, 7, 12> has chord (14, 7)
- <7, 3, 6, 9> has chord (3, 9)
- <7, 12, 11, 4> has chord (12, 4)
- <12, 7, 3, 6> has chord (7, 6)
- <2, 6, 9, 4> has chord (6, 4)
- <2, 8, 11, 4> has chord (8, 11)
- <2, 10, 9, 4> has chord (10, 9)
- <0, 6, 9, 4> has chord (6, 4)
- <0, 14, 9, 4> has chord (14, 9)
- <0, 3, 13, 4> has chord (3, 13)
- <14, 9, 7, 12> has chord (9, 12)
- <10, 9, 14, 12> has chord (9, 12)
