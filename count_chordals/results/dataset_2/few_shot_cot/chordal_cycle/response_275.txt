Response:
Step 1: 
- Start by finding all cycles of length 4 in the graph: 
<0, 4, 8, 12>
<0, 4, 18, 17>
<4, 8, 12, 18>
<4, 18, 17, 11>
<14, 1, 4, 18>
<14, 3, 19, 11>
<14, 3, 10, 5>
<14, 10, 5, 19>
<15, 16, 14, 1>
<15, 16, 14, 3>

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0, 4, 8, 12> (Chord: 8, 4)
<4, 8, 12, 18> (Chord: 8, 12)
<14, 1, 4, 18> (Chord: 1, 18)
<15, 16, 14, 1> (Chord: 16, 14)

Step 3:
- Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
[0]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle present in the graph is: <15, 16, 14, 3>
