Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 18) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 17) (9, 13) (9, 19) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 13) (4, 16) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 14) (7, 1) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 0) (13, 9) (13, 4) (13, 8) (13, 17) (13, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 11) (2, 0) (3, 17) (11, 2) (11, 14) (11, 0) (17, 9) (17, 13) (17, 3) (17, 15) (14, 7) (14, 11) (14, 12) (12, 5) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 6) (16, 4) (16, 1) (6, 13) (6, 12) (6, 10) (10, 6) (18, 5) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 16) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 11) (0, 12) (0, 19) (15, 17) (19, 9) (19, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 2, 11, 12, and node 19
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 16
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 11, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 17

Node 17 is connected to node 9, 13, 3, and node 15
Node 18 is connected to node 5
Node 19 is connected to node 9, and node 0

Response:
There are two chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, which are:

1. <0, 12, 6, 13> with chord (6, 12)
2. <1, 7, 4, 13> with chord (4, 7)

Therefore, the total number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
