Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 4) (6, 8) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 3) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 2, 5, 7, 1>
2. <0, 2, 5, 6, 1>
3. <0, 2, 3, 1, 6>
4. <0, 3, 1, 6, 5>
5. <0, 3, 1, 7, 5>
6. <0, 3, 2, 1, 6>
7. <1, 3, 2, 5, 7>
8. <1, 6, 5, 8, 9>
9. <2, 3, 1, 6, 5>
10. <2, 3, 8, 5, 6>
11. <3, 1, 6, 5, 7>
12. <3, 1, 7, 5, 6>

Step 2:
The chords in the cycles are as follows:
1. Chord in <0, 2, 5, 7, 1> is (2, 5)
2. Chord in <0, 3, 1, 7, 5> is (3, 5)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [10].
