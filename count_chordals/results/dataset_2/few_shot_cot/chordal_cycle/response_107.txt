Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 3) (9, 4) (9, 3) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 2) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 4, 9>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 4, 8>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 3, 8>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 3, 2>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 5, 3>
- Cycle 6: <0, 6, 1, 8>
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 5, 3>
- Cycle 8: <1, 6, 0, 7>
- Cycle 9: <2, 4, 7, 3>
- Cycle 10: <2, 4, 9, 3>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (7, 3)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (7, 3)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (6, 5)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (1, 8)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (6, 5)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (0, 7)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (4, 3)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (4, 3)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [0]

Final answer: [0]
