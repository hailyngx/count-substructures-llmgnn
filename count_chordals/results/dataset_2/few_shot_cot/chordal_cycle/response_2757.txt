Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 6, 9, 1, 0>
- Cycle <0, 6, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle <0, 6, 9, 3, 0>
- Cycle <0, 4, 9, 3, 0>
- Cycle <0, 4, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle <0, 4, 8, 5, 0>
- Cycle <1, 6, 9, 8, 1>
- Cycle <1, 4, 9, 8, 1>
- Cycle <2, 7, 6, 9, 2>
- Cycle <3, 9, 8, 5, 3>
- Cycle <4, 9, 8, 5, 4>
- Cycle <5, 8, 7, 2, 5>
- Cycle <6, 9, 8, 7, 6>
- Cycle <7, 8, 5, 3, 7>
- Cycle <8, 9, 6, 7, 8>
- Cycle <9, 6, 7, 2, 9>

Step 2:
Checking for chords in the cycles:
- <0, 6, 9, 1, 0>: Chords: (6, 1)
- <0, 4, 9, 3, 0>: Chords: (4, 3)
- <1, 6, 9, 8, 1>: Chords: (6, 8)
- <2, 7, 6, 9, 2>: Chords: (7, 9)
- <3, 9, 8, 5, 3>: Chords: (9, 5)
- <5, 8, 7, 2, 5>: Chords: (8, 2)
- <6, 9, 8, 7, 6>: Chords: (9, 7)
- <7, 8, 5, 3, 7>: Chords: (8, 3)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 6, 9, 1, 0>
- <0, 4, 9, 3, 0>
- <1, 6, 9, 8, 1>
- <2, 7, 6, 9, 2>
- <3, 9, 8, 5, 3>
- <5, 8, 7, 2, 5>
- <6, 9, 8, 7, 6>
- <7, 8, 5, 3, 7>
