Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph are:
1. <1, 7, 3, 0>
2. <1, 7, 3, 6>
3. <1, 7, 6, 3>
4. <1, 3, 7, 6>
5. <1, 3, 2, 9>
6. <1, 3, 8, 2>
7. <1, 3, 2, 4>
8. <1, 9, 2, 4>
9. <1, 9, 8, 2>
10. <1, 9, 8, 6>
11. <2, 4, 5, 8>
12. <2, 4, 1, 9>
13. <2, 4, 1, 7>
14. <2, 4, 1, 3>
15. <2, 4, 1, 6>
16. <2, 9, 1, 7>
17. <2, 9, 7, 5>
18. <2, 9, 7, 6>
19. <3, 1, 4, 2>
20. <3, 1, 9, 8>
21. <3, 1, 6, 7>
22. <3, 1, 7, 5>
23. <3, 1, 7, 6>
24. <3, 2, 9, 8>
25. <3, 2, 4, 1>
26. <3, 7, 6, 1>
27. <3, 7, 5, 8>
28. <3, 8, 5, 4>
29. <3, 8, 6, 7>
30. <4, 5, 8, 2>
31. <4, 5, 7, 6>
32. <5, 8, 2, 9>
33. <5, 8, 3, 7>
34. <5, 7, 6, 1>
35. <6, 7, 1, 9>
36. <7, 5, 8, 3>
37. <7, 5, 4, 1>
38. <8, 5, 4, 2>
39. <8, 3, 7, 6>
40. <8, 6, 7, 1>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
<1, 3, 7, 6, (1, 7)>
<2, 4, 1, 9, (2, 9)>
<2, 9, 1, 7, (1, 9)>
<3, 1, 7, 6, (1, 7)>
<3, 7, 6, 1, (3, 1)>
<4, 5, 8, 2, (4, 8)>
<4, 5, 7, 6, (4, 7)>
<5, 8, 3, 7, (5, 3)>
<5, 7, 6, 1, (5, 1)>
<6, 7, 1, 9, (6, 1)>
<7, 5, 8, 3, (7, 8)>
<8, 5, 4, 2, (4, 5)>

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [29].
