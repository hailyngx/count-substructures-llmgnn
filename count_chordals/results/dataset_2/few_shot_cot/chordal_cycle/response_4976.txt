Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph. The ones that satisfy the condition of having all edges present in the graph are:
1. Cycle <2, 8, 1, 18>
2. Cycle <2, 8, 11, 3>
3. Cycle <2, 8, 9, 3>
4. Cycle <2, 9, 3, 11>
5. Cycle <2, 9, 16, 5>
6. Cycle <2, 4, 13, 7>
7. Cycle <2, 5, 11, 7>
8. Cycle <2, 5, 15, 10>
9. Cycle <2, 5, 16, 9>
10. Cycle <2, 12, 14, 6>
11. Cycle <8, 1, 18, 17>
12. Cycle <8, 9, 3, 11>
13. Cycle <8, 9, 16, 5>
14. Cycle <8, 11, 3, 9>
15. Cycle <8, 11, 7, 13>
16. Cycle <8, 11, 5, 15>
17. Cycle <8, 18, 17, 15>
18. Cycle <3, 11, 7, 13>
19. Cycle <3, 9, 16, 5>
20. Cycle <11, 5, 16, 9>
21. Cycle <10, 15, 17, 18>
22. Cycle <10, 15, 5, 2>
23. Cycle <10, 4, 13, 7>
24. Cycle <15, 5, 16, 9>
25. Cycle <15, 17, 18, 8>
26. Cycle <17, 18, 8, 2>
27. Cycle <17, 18, 1, 8>

Step 2:
There are two cycles with exactly one chord:
1. Chordal cycle <2, 8, 11, 5, 16> with chord (9, 3)
2. Chordal cycle <2, 5, 15, 10, 4> with chord (13, 7)

Step 3:
There are two chordal 4-cycles found. Hence, the count of chordless cycles is [2].
