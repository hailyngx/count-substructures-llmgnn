Step 2 and 3: 
The chordal 4-cycles are:
- <5, 9, 22, 21 (7, 19)> 
- <5, 7, 9, 22 (9, 21)>
- <9, 7, 5, 24 (7, 5)>
- <29, 1, 25, 12 (1, 25)>
- <2, 29, 0, 10 (2, 0)> 
- <8, 10, 0, 29 (8, 0)>
- <14, 19, 21, 22 (19, 21)>
- <27, 17, 27, 18 (17, 18)>
 
Therefore, there are [7] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
