Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 14
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 6, 11, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 14, and node 13
Node 3 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 13, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 13, 2, 11, 4, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 10, 6, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 11, 0, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 8
Node 11 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 14
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 8, 14, 13, and node 6
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 4, 12, and node 2
Node 14 is connected to node 0, 11, 12, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <4, 1, 6, 8>
- <1, 3, 8, 6>
- <4, 1, 7, 8>
- <5, 9, 12, 13>
- <5, 9, 11, 1>
- <5, 9, 11, 14>
- <5, 9, 2, 14>
  
Step 2:
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <4, 1, 6, 8> has a chord (4, 8)
- <1, 3, 8, 6> has a chord (3, 6)
- <4, 1, 7, 8> has a chord (1, 8)
- <5, 9, 12, 13> has a chord (9, 13)
- <5, 9, 11, 1> has a chord (9, 1)
- <5, 9, 11, 14> has a chord (9, 14)
- <5, 9, 2, 14> has a chord (9, 14)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <4, 1, 6, 8>
- <1, 3, 8, 6>
- <4, 1, 7, 8>
- <5, 9, 12, 13>
- <5, 9, 11, 1>
- <5, 9, 11, 14>
- <5, 9, 2, 14>
