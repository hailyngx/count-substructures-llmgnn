Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Node 0, 4, 1, 7, 3
- Node 0, 4, 11, 13, 7
- Node 0, 4, 11, 3, 2
- Node 0, 8, 14, 13, 7
- Node 0, 8, 14, 13, 11
- Node 0, 12, 2, 13, 7
- Node 0, 12, 2, 6, 3
- Node 0, 12, 2, 10, 11
- Node 4, 11, 13, 7, 14
- Node 6, 9, 5, 12, 10
- Node 7, 1, 4, 11, 3
- Node 8, 4, 11, 3, 6
- Node 8, 4, 11, 10, 12
- Node 8, 12, 2, 6, 3
- Node 8, 12, 2, 10, 11
- Node 9, 5, 12, 8, 14
- Node 9, 6, 3, 11, 13
- Node 9, 6, 3, 7, 14
- Node 9, 6, 2, 10, 12

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 4, 1, 7, 3, (4, 7)>
- <0, 4, 11, 13, 7, (4, 13)>
- <0, 8, 14, 13, 7, (8, 13)>
- <4, 11, 13, 7, 14, (7, 14)>
- <7, 1, 4, 11, 3, (1, 11)>
- <8, 4, 11, 10, 12, (4, 10)>
- <9, 6, 3, 11, 13, (6, 11)>
- <9, 6, 3, 7, 14, (6, 7)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have [14].
