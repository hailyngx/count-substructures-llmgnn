Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 11, 15, 17>
- <1, 7, 16, 8>
- <1, 7, 16, 5>
- <1, 7, 13, 9>
- <1, 11, 15, 17>
- <2, 5, 16, 8>
- <2, 5, 16, 7>
- <2, 5, 12, 16>
- <2, 18, 19, 14>
- <3, 13, 9, 1>
- <3, 13, 4, 14>
- <3, 14, 10, 7>
- <4, 14, 19, 18>
- <4, 8, 16, 7>
- <4, 13, 7, 9>
- <5, 12, 16, 8>
- <6, 18, 19, 14>
- <7, 13, 9, 1>
- <7, 16, 8, 4>
- <9, 13, 4, 14>
- <11, 15, 17, 0>

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- <1, 7, 16, 8>
- <1, 7, 13, 9>
- <4, 14, 19, 18>
- <7, 16, 8, 4>

Step 3:
There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [4].
