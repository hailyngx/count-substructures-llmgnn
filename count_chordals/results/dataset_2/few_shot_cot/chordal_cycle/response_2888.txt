Step 2: Checking for a chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 1, 3, 7> (Chord: 1, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 7, 2, 8> (Chord: 2, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 3, 7, 12> (Chord: 3, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, 5, 6, 9> (Chord: 5, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, 7, 3, 10> (Chord: 2, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, 13, 2, 5> (Chord: 2, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, 6, 11, 1> (Chord: 1, 12)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [7]
