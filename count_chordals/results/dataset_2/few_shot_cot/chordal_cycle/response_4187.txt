Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: <0, 16, 11, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 16, 9, 15>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 15, 9>
- Cycle 4: <1, 13, 19, 5>
- Cycle 5: <1, 13, 19, 6>
- Cycle 6: <1, 13, 16, 11>
- Cycle 7: <3, 14, 8, 17>
- Cycle 8: <4, 14, 8, 9>
- Cycle 9: <4, 14, 3, 0>
- Cycle 10: <4, 14, 3, 6>
- Cycle 11: <4, 9, 15, 4>
- Cycle 12: <5, 19, 17, 8>
- Cycle 13: <5, 19, 6, 3>
- Cycle 14: <6, 19, 17, 8>
- Cycle 15: <7, 11, 10, 6>
- Cycle 16: <9, 16, 11, 13>
- Cycle 17: <9, 16, 11, 10>
- Cycle 18: <10, 12, 1, 13>
- Cycle 19: <10, 12, 2, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- The cycle <0, 16, 11, 7> has one chord: (0, 11)
- The cycle <0, 16, 9, 15> has one chord: (9, 16)
- The cycle <0, 4, 15, 9> has one chord: (4, 9)
- The cycle <1, 13, 19, 5> has one chord: (13, 5)
- The cycle <1, 13, 19, 6> has one chord: (13, 19)
- The cycle <1, 13, 16, 11> has one chord: (1, 16)
- The cycle <3, 14, 8, 17> has one chord: (8, 14)
- The cycle <4, 14, 8, 9> has one chord: (14, 8)
- The cycle <4, 14, 3, 6> has one chord: (4, 3)
- The cycle <9, 16, 11, 13> has one chord: (9, 11)
- The cycle <10, 12, 1, 13> has one chord: (1, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 9 chordless 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [9].
