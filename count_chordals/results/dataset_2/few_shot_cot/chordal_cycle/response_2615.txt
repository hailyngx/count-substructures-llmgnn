Response:
Step 1: 
Possible cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
1. <0, 11, 7, 1>
2. <0, 11, 7, 12>
3. <0, 5, 10, 11>
4. <0, 13, 1, 4>
5. <1, 7, 4, 2>
6. <1, 7, 12, 3>
7. <1, 9, 6, 3>
8. <1, 9, 6, 8>
9. <1, 13, 0, 12>
10. <2, 4, 1, 7>
11. <2, 8, 6, 9>
12. <2, 8, 14, 12>
13. <3, 6, 9, 8>
14. <3, 6, 1, 13>
15. <3, 12, 7, 1>
16. <4, 1, 9, 6>
17. <5, 3, 12, 0>
18. <5, 10, 11, 7>
19. <6, 9, 2, 4>
20. <6, 9, 1, 3>
21. <7, 1, 13, 0>
22. <7, 12, 14, 8>
23. <8, 6, 3, 12>
24. <9, 6, 8, 14>
25. <10, 11, 7, 1>
26. <11, 7, 1, 13>
27. <12, 7, 1, 9>
28. <13, 1, 9, 6>
29. <14, 6, 3, 12>
30. <14, 8, 6, 9>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
1. <1, 7, 12, 3> (Chord: 12)
2. <1, 9, 6, 3> (Chord: 9)
3. <2, 4, 1, 7> (Chord: 1)
4. <3, 6, 9, 8> (Chord: 9)
5. <3, 12, 7, 1> (Chord: 7)
6. <5, 10, 11, 7> (Chord: 11)
7. <6, 9, 1, 3> (Chord: 9)
8. <7, 1, 13, 0> (Chord: 1)
9. <7, 12, 14, 8> (Chord: 14)
10. <9, 6, 8, 14> (Chord: 8)

Step 3:
Thus, there are 10 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [10].
