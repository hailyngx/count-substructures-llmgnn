Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 10, 7, 2>
- <0, 10, 9, 8>
- <1, 3, 13, 8>
- <1, 2, 7, 11>
- <1, 2, 12, 5>
- <1, 3, 8, 9>
- <2, 7, 11, 12>
- <2, 7, 9, 10>
- <4, 0, 12, 11>
- <4, 2, 7, 6>
- <4, 2, 12, 5>
- <4, 6, 7, 11>
- <5, 8, 13, 14>
- <5, 12, 11, 2>
- <5, 12, 11, 8>
- <5, 13, 8, 3>
- <8, 3, 1, 2>
- <8, 3, 13, 14>
- <8, 5, 12, 2>
- <8, 9, 7, 6>
- <8, 9, 10, 0>
- <8, 11, 12, 2>
- <9, 8, 13, 14>
- <9, 10, 0, 4>
- <10, 8, 11, 7>
- <10, 9, 7, 6>
- <11, 8, 9, 10>
- <12, 5, 8, 3>
- <12, 5, 14, 13>
- <12, 11, 7, 6>
- <13, 3, 1, 2>
- <13, 5, 12, 11>
- <13, 5, 14, 4>
- <13, 8, 3, 1>
- <14, 5, 12, 0>
- <14, 5, 13, 8>
- <14, 4, 6, 7>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
<1, 3, 13, 8> has one chord (3, 13)
<1, 2, 7, 11> has one chord (2, 7)
<1, 2, 12, 5> has one chord (2, 12)
<1, 3, 8, 9> has one chord (3, 8)
<2, 7, 11, 12> has one chord (7, 11)
<4, 2, 12, 5> has one chord (2, 12)
<5, 8, 13, 14> has one chord (8, 13)
<5, 12, 11, 2> has one chord (11, 12)
<5, 12, 11, 8> has one chord (11, 12)
<9, 10, 0, 4> has one chord (0, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
