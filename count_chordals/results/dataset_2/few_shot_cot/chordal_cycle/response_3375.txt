Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 7) (11, 1) (11, 9) (11, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (2, 4) (2, 12) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 14) (5, 11) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (13, 3) (13, 9) (13, 14) (13, 7) (12, 2) (12, 6) (12, 9) (0, 10) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 9) (3, 13) (3, 6) (3, 9) (1, 11) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 7) (6, 12) (6, 3) (6, 14) (14, 2) (14, 13) (14, 6) (14, 7) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 13) (7, 1) (7, 14) (9, 11) (9, 13) (9, 12) (9, 0) (9, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 10, 4, 8, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 11, 4, 8, 2, and node 7

Node 6 is connected to node 12, 3, and node 14
Node 7 is connected to node 10, 8, 13, 1, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 11, 13, 12, 0, and node 3
Node 10 is connected to node 0, and node 7
Node 11 is connected to node 1, 9, and node 5
Node 12 is connected to node 2, 6, and node 9
Node 13 is connected to node 3, 9, 14, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 2, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 11, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 8, 4>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 13, 3>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 8, 7>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 14, 2>
- Cycle 7: <2, 4, 8, 5>
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 11, 1>
- Cycle 9: <2, 14, 13, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 6, 12, 9>
- Cycle 11: <3, 9, 11, 5>
- Cycle 12: <3, 9, 13, 7>
- Cycle 13: <4, 8, 7, 14>
- Cycle 14: <5, 2, 14, 6>
- Cycle 15: <5, 8, 7, 14>
- Cycle 16: <6, 12, 9, 13>
- Cycle 17: <7, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle 18: <7, 14, 2, 1>
- Cycle 19: <9, 11, 1, 4>
- Cycle 20: <9, 12, 2, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycles: 
<1, 4, 2, 8> 
<2, 5, 14, 7> 
<3, 9, 11, 5> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

- Count of chordless cycles = 20 - 3 = 17

Final answer: [17]
