Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

1. Cycle 1: <1, 6, 13, 5> with chord (6, 5)
2. Cycle 2: <1, 6, 2, 14> with chord (6, 14)
3. Cycle 3: <1, 6, 7, 14> with chord (6, 7)
4. Cycle 4: <1, 6, 2, 10> with chord (2, 10)
5. Cycle 5: <1, 6, 7, 10> with chord (7, 10)
6. Cycle 6: <1, 6, 13, 0> with chord (13, 0)
7. Cycle 7: <1, 11, 7, 14> with chord (11, 14)
8. Cycle 8: <1, 11, 7, 10> with chord (11, 10)
9. Cycle 9: <1, 11, 7, 6> with chord (11, 6)
10. Cycle 10: <1, 11, 7, 10, 9> with chord (10, 9)
11. Cycle 11: <1, 0, 13, 5> with chord (0, 5)
12. Cycle 12: <1, 0, 13, 6> with chord (0, 6)
13. Cycle 13: <2, 14, 9, 7> with chord (14, 9)
14. Cycle 14: <2, 14, 7, 10> with chord (14, 10)
15. Cycle 15: <3, 9, 0, 13> with chord (9, 13)
16. Cycle 16: <3, 9, 14, 7> with chord (9, 14)
17. Cycle 17: <3, 9, 10, 5> with chord (10, 5)
18. Cycle 18: <4, 3, 9, 10> with chord (3, 10)
19. Cycle 19: <4, 3, 9, 14> with chord (3, 14)
20. Cycle 20: <5, 3, 9, 14> with chord (3, 14)
21. Cycle 21: <5, 3, 4, 12> with chord (3, 12)
22. Cycle 22: <5, 12, 4, 3> with chord (12, 3)
23. Cycle 23: <5, 12, 9, 14> with chord (12, 14)
24. Cycle 24: <6, 7, 14, 9> with chord (7, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Out of the 24 cycles listed above, only the following cycles have exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 1: <1, 6, 13, 5> with chord (6, 5)
2. Cycle 7: <1, 11, 7, 14> with chord (11, 14)
3. Cycle 8: <1, 11, 7, 10> with chord (11, 10)
4. Cycle 13: <2, 14, 9, 7> with chord (14, 9)
5. Cycle 15: <3, 9, 0, 13> with chord (9, 13)
6. Cycle 18: <4, 3, 9, 10> with chord (3, 10)
7. Cycle 21: <5, 3, 4, 12> with chord (3, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, therefore [7].
