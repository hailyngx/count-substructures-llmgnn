Step 2:
After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, (9, 13), 8>
- <1, (12, 4), 6>
- <1, (0, 13), 6>
- <1, (2, 14), 6>
- <3, (5, 11), 4>
- <3, (9, 6), 11>
- <4, (5, 12), 10>
- <4, (10, 6), 12>
- <5, (11, 4), 3>
- <6, (1, 9), 13>
- <6, (10, 2), 14>
- <6, (0, 8), 13>
- <6, (12, 1), 4>
- <6, (3, 11), 14>
- <9, (13, 8), 11>
- <9, (13, 2), 14>
- <12, (9, 6), 1>
- <13, (8, 11), 5>
- <13, (2, 14), 9>

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [16].
