Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 0, 4, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 6, 7, 4, 0, 3, 1, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 9, 1, 3, 7, 4, 0, 9>
- Cycle 6: <5, 2, 4, 0, 9, 6, 7, 3, 2>
- Cycle 7: <5, 2, 3, 0, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 8: <5, 8, 1, 3, 0, 4, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 9: <5, 1, 3, 0, 4, 7, 6, 9>
- Cycle 10: <5, 1, 3, 7, 6, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 11: <5, 1, 3, 7, 4, 0, 9, 5>
- Cycle 12: <5, 1, 8, 9, 0, 4, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 13: <5, 8, 9, 6, 7, 4, 0, 3, 1>
- Cycle 14: <5, 8, 9, 6, 7, 3, 0, 4>
- Cycle 15: <5, 8, 9, 0, 4, 7, 6, 2, 5>
- Cycle 16: <5, 8, 9, 1, 3, 7, 4, 0>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1: <5, 9, 1, 5> has exactly one chord: (9, 1)
- Cycle 2: <5, 9, 8, 5> has exactly one chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 3: <5, 9, 0, 4, 7, 6, 5> has exactly one chord: (9, 6)
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 6, 7, 4, 0, 3, 1, 5> has exactly one chord: (9, 4)
- Cycle 5: <5, 9, 1, 3, 7, 4, 0, 9> has exactly one chord: (9, 3)
- Cycle 6: <5, 2, 4, 0, 9, 6, 7, 3, 2> has exactly one chord: (5, 2)
- Cycle 12: <5, 1, 8, 9, 0, 4, 7, 6, 5> has exactly one chord: (1, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordless cycles = 6, so [6]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
- <5, 9, 1, 5> with chord (9, 1)
- <5, 9, 8, 5> with chord (9, 8)
- <5, 9, 0, 4, 7, 6, 5> with chord (9, 6)
- <5, 9, 6, 7, 4, 0, 3, 1, 5> with chord (9, 4)
- <5, 9, 1, 3, 7, 4, 0, 9> with chord (9, 3)
- <5, 1, 8, 9, 0, 4, 7, 6, 5> with chord (1, 8)
