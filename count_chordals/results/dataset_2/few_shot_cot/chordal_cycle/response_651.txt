Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

After checking each cycle above, the unique chordal 4-cycle is: <0, 7, 5, 13> with a single chord (7, 13).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 62 cycles listed. The unique chordal 4-cycle is <0, 7, 5, 13>. Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [61].
