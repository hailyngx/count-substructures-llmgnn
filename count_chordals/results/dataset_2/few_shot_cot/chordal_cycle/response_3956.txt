Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is <1, 19, 16, 27>.

Here's the step-by-step process to count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
   - Cycle 1: (1, 6, 21, 28) of length 4.
   - Cycle 2: (1, 6, 7, 28) of length 4.
   - Cycle 3: (1, 19, 16, 27) of length 4 (unique chordal 4-cycle).

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
   - Cycle 1: (1, 6, 21, 28) - no chord.
   - Cycle 2: (1, 6, 7, 28) - no chord.
   - Cycle 3: (1, 19, 16, 27) - has exactly one chord (19, 16).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
   - There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, which is <1, 19, 16, 27>.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
