Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 8) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 2) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 8, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 5, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 9, 8, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 1, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 3, 9, 8, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 2, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 7, 4, 2, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 5, 3, 7, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 7, 4, 2, 3>
- Cycle 8: <4, 7, 5, 2, 4>
- Cycle 9: <6, 1, 7, 3, 6>
- Cycle 10: <8, 9, 3, 5, 8>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 9, 8, 0> has exactly one chord (9, 8)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1].
