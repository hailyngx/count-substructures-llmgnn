Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 1) (2, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 6, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 2, 7, 4, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 6, 2, 5, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 6, 2, 7, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 5: (1, 4, 7, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 6: (0, 6, 1, 4, 0)
- Cycle 7: (0, 6, 1, 3, 0)
- Cycle 8: (0, 6, 9, 3, 0)
- Cycle 9: (0, 4, 7, 9, 0)
- Cycle 10: (5, 9, 6, 2, 5)
- Cycle 11: (5, 9, 3, 1, 5)
- Cycle 12: (5, 9, 3, 0, 6, 5)
- Cycle 13: (5, 9, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 14: (5, 2, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 15: (5, 2, 6, 0, 3, 5)
- Cycle 16: (5, 2, 7, 4, 5)
- Cycle 17: (5, 8, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 18: (5, 8, 6, 0, 3, 5)
- Cycle 19: (5, 8, 7, 4, 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (2, 7), 4, 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (6, 1), 4, 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (2, 6), 9, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
Since we found 3 unique chordal 4-cycles, the number of chordless cycles is [16].
