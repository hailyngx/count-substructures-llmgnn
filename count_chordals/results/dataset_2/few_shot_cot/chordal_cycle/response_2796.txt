Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 1) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 0) (2, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 3: <0, 8, 5, 7>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 6, 5>
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 5, 7>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 8, 9>
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 8: <3, 5, 7, 6>
- Cycle 9: <3, 6, 9, 8>
- Cycle 10: <3, 4, 7, 2>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 2 <0, 4, 7, 5> has one chord: (0, 7)
- Cycle 3 <0, 8, 5, 7> has one chord: (0, 5)
- Cycle 8 <3, 5, 7, 6> has one chord: (3, 7)
- Cycle 9 <3, 6, 9, 8> has one chord: (3, 9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 6 chordal 4-cycles: <0, 4, 7, 5>, <0, 8, 5, 7>, <3, 5, 7, 6>, <3, 6, 9, 8>

Therefore, the total number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [4].
