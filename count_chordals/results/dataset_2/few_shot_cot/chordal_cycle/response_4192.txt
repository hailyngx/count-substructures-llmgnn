Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 4, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 7, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 0-1-3-4-0
- Cycle 0-1-4-7-0
- Cycle 0-1-3-2-7-0
- Cycle 0-3-2-7-0
- Cycle 0-3-4-7-0
- Cycle 0-4-7-2-0
- Cycle 1-3-2-4-1
- Cycle 1-4-7-2-1
- Cycle 3-4-7-2-3
- Cycle 4-7-2-8-4

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the cycle 0-1-4-7-0 has exactly one chord, which is the edge (1, 4). The other cycles either have zero chords or more than one chord.

Step 3:
Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, 1, 4, 7>
