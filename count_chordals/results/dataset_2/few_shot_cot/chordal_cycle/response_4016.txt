Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 1) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 8, 1, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 3, 0, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 9, 4, 0, 1, 8, 2>
- Cycle 9: <3, 5, 9, 2, 6, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 5, 7, 4, 9, 2, 6, 3>
- Cycle 11: <4, 0, 3, 6, 2, 9, 4>
- Cycle 12: <5, 9, 2, 6, 5>
- Cycle 13: <5, 9, 4, 8, 1, 7, 5>
- Cycle 14: <5, 7, 4, 9, 2, 6, 5>
- Cycle 15: <6, 3, 0, 1, 5, 7, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle 16: <7, 5, 1, 8, 4, 9, 2, 6, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 4, 1, 5, 0>, Chord: (4, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 4, 8, 1, 0>, Chord: (4, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 16 cycles found and 2 of them have exactly one chord. Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [14].
