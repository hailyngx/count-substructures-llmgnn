Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 12, 7, 10, 9, 1>
2. Cycle <0, 12, 2, 9, 10, 13>
3. Cycle <0, 12, 7, 6, 14, 13>
4. Cycle <0, 5, 2, 12, 7, 10>
5. Cycle <1, 9, 2, 12, 7, 10>
6. Cycle <3, 4, 5, 7, 6, 14>
7. Cycle <3, 4, 5, 2, 12, 7>
8. Cycle <3, 4, 5, 0, 12, 7>
9. Cycle <3, 2, 5, 7, 6, 14>
10. Cycle <3, 2, 5, 0, 12, 7>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:
1. Chordal 4-cycle <0, 12, 7, 10, 9, 1> with chord (9, 1)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [9].
