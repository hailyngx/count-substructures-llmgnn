Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 1) (1, 7) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 7, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 7, 3, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (2, 5, 4, 6, 2)
- Cycle 2: (2, 7, 1, 8, 2)
- Cycle 3: (2, 7, 9, 5, 2)
- Cycle 4: (2, 7, 9, 8, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 4, 0, 7, 2)
- Cycle 6: (2, 4, 5, 9, 2)
- Cycle 7: (2, 5, 9, 8, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 5, 9, 7, 2)
- Cycle 9: (2, 3, 6, 4, 2)
- Cycle 10: (4, 0, 7, 9, 4)
- Cycle 11: (4, 0, 9, 5, 4)
- Cycle 12: (4, 6, 3, 8, 4)
- Cycle 13: (4, 6, 2, 5, 4)
- Cycle 14: (4, 6, 2, 7, 4)
  
Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (2, 4), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <3, (6, 8), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (2, 7), 9>

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles = [11]
