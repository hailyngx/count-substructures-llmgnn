Response:
Based on the given graph, we can determine the number of unique chordal 4-cycles as follows:

Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 14-1-6-4-14
- Cycle 2: 17-8-6-18-17
- Cycle 3: 4-11-19-9-4
- Cycle 4: 18-9-15-12-18
- Cycle 5: 10-2-12-15-10
- Cycle 6: 2-10-4-6-2

Step 2:
Identify chordal 4-cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle <14, (1, 6), 4>: 14-1-6-4-14
- Chordal 4-cycle <17, (8, 18), 11>: 17-8-6-18-17

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: [4]

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [2].
