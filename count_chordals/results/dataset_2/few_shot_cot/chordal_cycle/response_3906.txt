Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycles of length 4: 
  - (9, 0, 22, 20, 9)
  - (9, 0, 20, 22, 9)
  - (0, 20, 22, 7, 0)
  - (20, 22, 7, 16, 20)

  - (22, 0, 9, 26, 22)
  - (20, 0, 9, 19, 20)
  - (0, 9, 19, 8, 0)
  - (0, 20, 23, 12, 0)

Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycles:
  - <9, (0, 20), 22>
  - <0, (9, 22), 20>
  - <20, (12, 22), 0>
  - <22, (0, 7), 16>
  - <12, (17, 1), 20>
  - <27, (9, 19), 13>
  - <22, (7, 16), 6>
  - <1, (12, 29), 15>
  - <5, (3, 28), 11>
  - <24, (4, 29), 5>
  - <13, (15, 1), 19>

Step 3:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [10]
