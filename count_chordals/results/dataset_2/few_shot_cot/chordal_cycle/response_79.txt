Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 5, 9>
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 14, 11>
- Cycle 3: <1, 5, 6, 14>
- Cycle 4: <4, 7, 12, 14>
- Cycle 5: <4, 6, 14, 10>
- Cycle 6: <4, 6, 9, 5>
- Cycle 7: <6, 9, 5, 14>
- Cycle 8: <6, 8, 1, 5>
- Cycle 9: <6, 13, 2, 11>
- Cycle 10: <10, 4, 6, 13>
- Cycle 11: <10, 4, 7, 12>
- Cycle 12: <10, 14, 5, 9>
- Cycle 13: <10, 14, 11, 2>
- Cycle 14: <11, 14, 12, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <0, 1, 5, 9> has a chord 1-5.
- <1, 5, 14, 11> has a chord 5-11.
- <1, 5, 6, 14> has a chord 5-6.
- <4, 7, 12, 14> has a chord 7-12.
- <4, 6, 14, 10> has a chord 6-14.
- <6, 9, 5, 14> has a chord 9-14.
- <6, 8, 1, 5> has a chord 1-5.
- <6, 13, 2, 11> has a chord 2-11.
- <10, 4, 6, 13> has a chord 4-6.
- <10, 4, 7, 12> has a chord 4-7.
- <10, 14, 5, 9> has a chord 5-9.
- <10, 14, 11, 2> has a chord 11-2.
- <11, 14, 12, 7> has a chord 12-7.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 13 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [13].
