Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 2) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 5) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 5, 8, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, 5, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 3, 0, 6, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 3, 2, 5, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 3, 0, 8, 2)
- Cycle 4: (3, 4, 6, 7, 3)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 7, 8, 5)
- Cycle 6: (6, 1, 3, 4, 6)
- Cycle 7: (7, 5, 2, 3, 7)
- Cycle 8: (8, 0, 3, 2, 8)
- Cycle 9: (9, 1, 3, 2, 9)

Step 2:
Checking cycles for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <(0, 6)>
- Cycle 2 <(3, 5)>
- Cycle 3 <(0, 8)>
- Cycle 4 <(4, 7)>
- Cycle 5 <(6, 7)>
- Cycle 6 <(1, 4)>
- Cycle 7 <(2, 3)>
- Cycle 8 <(0, 2)>
- Cycle 9 <(1, 2)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [9]
