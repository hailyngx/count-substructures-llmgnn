Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges:
- (0, 9, 5, 18, 11, 3, 12, 0)
- (0, 9, 5, 18, 7, 1, 6, 14, 13, 0)
- (0, 9, 19, 17, 0)
- (1, 6, 14, 13, 0, 12, 17, 16, 15, 7, 19, 2, 10, 2, 8, 3, 11, 18, 5, 9, 19, 7, 1)
- (2, 8, 3, 11, 18, 7, 1, 6, 14, 13, 18, 5, 0, 12, 17, 16, 8, 2)
- (3, 8, 2, 1, 7, 18, 11, 12, 0, 13, 14, 6, 1, 7, 19, 17, 16, 15, 7)
- (5, 9, 19, 17, 16, 8, 2, 10, 2, 19, 7, 1, 6, 14, 13, 18, 11, 3, 12, 17, 0)
- (7, 1, 6, 14, 13, 0, 12, 17, 16, 8, 3, 11, 18, 5, 9, 19, 17, 0)
- (9, 19, 2, 1, 6, 14, 13, 0, 12, 17, 16, 15, 7, 18, 5, 11, 3, 8, 2, 10, 2)
  
Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, (9, 13), 17, 12>
- <0, (9, 5), 18, 7>
- <0, (17, 16), 15, 7>
- <1, (6, 14), 13, 18>
- <2, (8, 3), 11, 18>
- <3, (8, 2), 1, 7>
- <5, (9, 19), 17, 16>
- <7, (1, 6), 14, 13>
- <9, (19, 2), 1, 6>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [9] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
