Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 3) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 3) (1, 4) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 4, 7, 2, 0)
- Cycle 2: (0, 5, 4, 3, 0)
- Cycle 3: (0, 5, 8, 4, 3, 0)
- Cycle 4: (0, 6, 9, 3, 0)
- Cycle 5: (0, 6, 2, 4, 5, 0)
- Cycle 6: (1, 4, 7, 2, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 4, 7, 6, 2)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 2 has no chords
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 4 has no chords
- Cycle 5 has no chords
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (4, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [3]
Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (5, 8), 4, 7, 2>
