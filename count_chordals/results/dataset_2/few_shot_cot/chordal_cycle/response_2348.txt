Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <1, (2, 4), 13>. 

To find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph, we can follow the steps mentioned earlier:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more - 
- Cycle with nodes 1, 2, 4, and 13. (This is the chordal 4-cycle <1, (2, 4), 13>)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord - 
- In the cycle 1-2-4-13, edge (2, 4) is the chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found - 
Since we found 1 unique chordal 4-cycle, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
