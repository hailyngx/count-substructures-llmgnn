Response:
In this graph, let's find the number of chordal 4-cycles:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- <8, 13, 3, 12>
- <8, 13, 3, 7>
- <8, 13, 14, 4>
- <8, 13, 14, 16>
- <8, 13, 3, 7, 11>
- <8, 13, 14, 4, 11>
- <8, 13, 14, 4, 18>
- <8, 13, 3, 12, 10>
- <8, 13, 14, 16, 19>
- <8, 5, 2, 12>
- <8, 5, 2, 15>
- <8, 5, 1, 0>
- <8, 5, 1, 5>
- <8, 5, 2, 12, 10>
- <8, 5, 2, 15, 17>
- <8, 9, 7, 3>
- <8, 9, 7, 11>
- <8, 9, 7, 3, 12>
- <8, 9, 0, 1>
- <8, 9, 0, 11>
- <8, 9, 0, 1, 5>
- <8, 9, 0, 1, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- <8, 13, 3, 12> has chord 3-12
- <8, 13, 3, 7> has chord 3-7
- <8, 13, 14, 4> has chord 14-4
- <8, 13, 14, 16> has chord 14-16
- <8, 13, 3, 7, 11> has chord 3-11
- <8, 13, 14, 4, 11> has chord 4-11
- <8, 13, 14, 4, 18> has chord 4-18
- <8, 13, 3, 12, 10> has chord 3-10
- <8, 13, 14, 16, 19> has chord 16-19
- <8, 5, 2, 12> has chord 2-12
- <8, 5, 2, 15> has chord 2-15
- <8, 9, 7, 3> has chord 7-3
- <8, 9, 0, 1> has chord 0-1

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found. 
There are 13 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the number of chordless 4-cycles is [13].
