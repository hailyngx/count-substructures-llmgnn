Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <7, 21, 28, 13>, Chord: (25, 15)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <7, 21, 14, 26>, Chord: (4, 22)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <7, 26, 4, 22>, Chord: (21, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <21, 28, 13, 25>, Chord: (14, 26)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <23, 11, 0, 16>, Chord: (24, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <23, 11, 24, 12>, Chord: (0, 16)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <17, 29, 25, 13>, Chord: (18, 19)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <29, 18, 19, 22>, Chord: (13, 25)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <28, 13, 25, 15>, Chord: (21, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <9, 1, 12, 24>, Chord: (4, 22)
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <5, 11, 0, 16>, Chord: (20, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [11].
