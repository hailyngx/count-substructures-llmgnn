Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more with all edges existing:
- <0, 12, 8, 5, 6>
- <1, 7, 0, 12, 4>
- <2, 11, 8, 5, 6>
- <3, 10, 7, 1, 11>
- <4, 9, 14, 2, 6>
- <5, 6, 3, 13, 7>
- <7, 4, 12, 8, 11>
- <9, 14, 2, 6, 5>
- <13, 14, 2, 6, 5>

Step 2: Checking for chorded 4-cycles:
- Checking <0, 12, 8, 5, 6>: One chord (5, 8)
- Checking <1, 7, 0, 12, 4>: One chord (1, 4)
- Checking <2, 11, 8, 5, 6>: One chord (2, 8)
- Checking <3, 10, 7, 1, 11>: No chords
- Checking <4, 9, 14, 2, 6>: No chords
- Checking <5, 6, 3, 13, 7>: No chords
- Checking <7, 4, 12, 8, 11>: No chords
- Checking <9, 14, 2, 6, 5>: One chord (5, 6)
- Checking <13, 14, 2, 6, 5>: One chord (5, 6)

Step 3: Count of chordless 4-cycles = [3]
