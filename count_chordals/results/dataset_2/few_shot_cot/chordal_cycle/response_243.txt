Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more: 
<0, 9, 11, 17>, <0, 10, 17, 14>, <0, 15, 18, 17>, <0, 15, 13, 19>, <3, 18, 15, 8>, <3, 7, 8, 16>, <3, 12, 10, 6>, <3, 12, 6, 4>, <7, 8, 15, 18>, <7, 3, 12, 6>, <9, 11, 17, 14>, <14, 17, 11, 9>, <15, 8, 16, 17>, <15, 18, 17, 14>

Step 2: 
Unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord:
<0, (15, 10), 14>, <0, (15, 18), 17>, <0, (15, 13), 19>, <3, (7, 6), 12>, <7, (8, 3), 12>, <9, (11, 14), 17>, <3, (12, 6), 10>, <14, (17, 0), 6>, <17, (11, 14), 9>, <15, (8, 16), 17>

Step 3: 
Number of chordless cycles found: [5]
