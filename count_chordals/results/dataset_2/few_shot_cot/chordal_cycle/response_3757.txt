Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (1, 7) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 0) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (7, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, 8, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph of length 4 or more. 

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-3-6-0
- Cycle 2: 0-2-3-8-0
- Cycle 3: 1-3-8-7-1
- Cycle 4: 4-8-7-6-4
- Cycle 5: 4-8-2-3-4
- Cycle 6: 0-6-7-8-0
- Cycle 7: 5-7-1-8-5
- Cycle 8: 4-9-3-6-4
- Cycle 9: 9-5-7-6-9

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 1-6
- Cycle 2 has a chord 0-3
- Cycle 3 has a chord 1-8
- Cycle 4 has a chord 4-7
- Cycle 5 has a chord 8-3
- Cycle 6 has a chord 6-7
- Cycle 7 has a chord 7-1
- Cycle 8 has a chord 4-3
- Cycle 9 has a chord 9-7

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 0 chordless 4-cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [0].
