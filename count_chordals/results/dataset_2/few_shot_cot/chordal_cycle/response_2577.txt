Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 6, 9, 4, 7>
- <0, 6, 8, 1, 7>
- <1, 4, 7, 11, 5>
- <1, 4, 5, 8, 0>
- <1, 7, 2, 9, 13>
- <2, 7, 1, 4, 9>
- <2, 9, 13, 5, 4>
- <2, 9, 14, 3, 12>
- <3, 14, 9, 6, 8>
- <3, 14, 13, 5, 11>
- <4, 9, 13, 5, 12>
- <5, 4, 9, 6, 0>
- <5, 11, 7, 4, 9>
- <5, 11, 10, 1, 8>
- <5, 12, 3, 14, 9>
- <5, 13, 9, 6, 0>
- <7, 4, 9, 13, 5>
- <7, 10, 5, 13, 9>
- <8, 6, 9, 13, 5>
- <10, 7, 1, 4, 9>
- <10, 12, 3, 14, 13>
- <11, 7, 4, 5, 8>
- <12, 3, 14, 9, 6>
- <12, 5, 13, 9, 6>
- <13, 9, 6, 0, 8>
- <14, 9, 6, 8, 5>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, (8, 6), 7> (Chord: 8-6)
- <1, (8, 4), 7> (Chord: 8-4)
- <1, (2, 9), 13> (Chord: 2-9)
- <2, (7, 13), 9> (Chord: 7-13)
- <3, (9, 14), 6> (Chord: 9-14)
- <4, (7, 5), 9> (Chord: 7-5)
- <5, (4, 9), 13> (Chord: 4-9)
- <7, (4, 9), 13> (Chord: 4-9)
- <10, (1, 7), 4> (Chord: 1-7)
- <11, (7, 5), 4> (Chord: 7-5)
- <12, (5, 13), 9> (Chord: 5-13)
- <13, (9, 6), 0> (Chord: 9-6)
- <14, (6, 8), 9> (Chord: 6-8)

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles is [15].
