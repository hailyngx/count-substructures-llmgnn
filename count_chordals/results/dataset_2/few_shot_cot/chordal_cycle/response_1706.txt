Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <13, 22, 23, 15> has one chord (13, 15)
- <13, 5, 0, 10> has one chord (5, 10)
- <13, 5, 15, 23> has one chord (5, 15)
- <21, 12, 4, 11> has one chord (12, 11)
- <21, 12, 4, 3> has one chord (12, 3)
- <7, 21, 12, 4> has one chord (21, 4)
- <7, 21, 10, 9> has one chord (21, 10)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 44 cycles and 7 of them have exactly one chord. So the number of chordal 4-cycles is [37].
