- Cycle 13: <3, 1, 8, 6, 7> (length 5)
- Cycle 14: <3, 4, 1, 9, 5> (length 5)
- Cycle 15: <3, 4, 2, 9, 1> (length 5)
- Cycle 16: <3, 4, 6, 7, 8> (length 5)
- Cycle 17: <3, 6, 7, 8, 5> (length 5)
- Cycle 18: <3, 6, 8, 5, 9> (length 5)
- Cycle 19: <3, 6, 8, 7, 1> (length 5)
- Cycle 20: <4, 1, 9, 2, 4> (length 5)
- Cycle 21: <4, 2, 9, 1, 3> (length 5)
- Cycle 22: <4, 3, 1, 8, 6> (length 5)
- Cycle 23: <4, 3, 6, 7, 8> (length 5)
- Cycle 24: <4, 6, 3, 1, 9> (length 5)
- Cycle 25: <4, 6, 7, 8, 5> (length 5)
- Cycle 26: <5, 9, 1, 3, 4> (length 5)
- Cycle 27: <5, 9, 2, 1, 3> (length 5)
- Cycle 28: <5, 9, 8, 6, 3> (length 5)
- Cycle 29: <6, 3, 1, 9, 5> (length 5)
- Cycle 30: <6, 3, 4, 1, 9> (length 5)
- Cycle 31: <6, 4, 1, 3, 8> (length 5)
- Cycle 32: <6, 4, 2, 9, 1> (length 5)
- Cycle 33: <7, 3, 1, 9, 5> (length 5)
- Cycle 34: <7, 3, 4, 1, 9> (length 5)
- Cycle 35: <7, 6, 3, 1, 9> (length 5)
- Cycle 36: <8, 1, 9, 5, 0> (length 5)
- Cycle 37: <8, 3, 1, 9, 5> (length 5)
- Cycle 38: <8, 3, 4, 1, 9> (length 5)
- Cycle 39: <8, 6, 3, 1, 9> (length 5)
- Cycle 40: <8, 7, 6, 3, 1> (length 5)
- Cycle 41: <8, 7, 6, 4, 2> (length 5)
- Cycle 42: <8, 7, 6, 4, 3> (length 5)
- Cycle 43: <9, 1, 3, 4, 2> (length 5)
- Cycle 44: <9, 1, 8, 6, 3> (length 5)
- Cycle 45: <9, 2, 1, 3, 4> (length 5)
- Cycle 46: <9, 2, 4, 3, 1> (length 5)
- Cycle 47: <9, 5, 8, 6, 3> (length 5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 9, 1, 4>: Chord = (5, 1)
- <1, 8, 7, 6, 3>: Chord = (8, 6)
- <3, 4, 6, 7, 8>: Chord = (4, 7)
- <4, 1, 9, 2, 4>: Chord = (1, 2)
- <5, 9, 1, 3, 4>: Chord = (9, 3)
- <7, 6, 3, 1, 9>: Chord = (6, 1)
- <8, 1, 9, 5, 0>: Chord = (1, 0)
- <9, 1, 3, 4, 2>: Chord = (1, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 40 cycles with chords, so the number of chordless cycles is 47 - 40 = 7.

Therefore, the answer is [7].
