Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
1. <1, 3, 17, 5>, chord (1, 5)
2. <1, 16, 8, 15>, chord (8, 15)
3. <3, 17, 7, 16>, chord (7, 16)
4. <4, 14, 15, 9>, chord (14, 9)
5. <4, 19, 15, 8>, chord (4, 15)
6. <7, 5, 17, 3>, chord (5, 3)
7. <9, 15, 19, 4>, chord (9, 4)
8. <12, 18, 13, 3>, chord (18, 3)
9. <14, 2, 6, 16>, chord (2, 16)
10. <15, 14, 2, 6>, chord (14, 6)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [36].
