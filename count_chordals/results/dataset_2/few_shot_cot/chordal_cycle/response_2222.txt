Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 11) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 11) (9, 10) (9, 12) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 13) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 14) (8, 1) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 14) (2, 0) (12, 9) (12, 2) (12, 0) (12, 11) (11, 6) (11, 9) (11, 7) (11, 12) (11, 0) (5, 0) (3, 4) (3, 14) (3, 10) (3, 13) (14, 8) (14, 2) (14, 3) (14, 1) (13, 6) (13, 7) (13, 3) (13, 1) (10, 9) (10, 3) (10, 1) (1, 8) (1, 14) (1, 13) (1, 10) (0, 2) (0, 12) (0, 11) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 2, 12, 11, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 14, 13, and node 10
Node 2 is connected to node 8, 12, 14, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 14, 10, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 11, 4, and node 13
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 11, and node 13
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 14, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 11, 10, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 1
Node 11 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, 12, and node 0
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 6, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 14 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, and node 1

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <6, 4, 8, 9> with the non-adjacent chord (4, 9).

Following the steps provided earlier:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph - Two 4-cycles are: <6, 4, 8, 9> and <6, 7, 11, 12>.
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord - <6, 4, 8, 9> has one chord (6, 8).
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found - Only one chordal 4-cycle is found.

So, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
