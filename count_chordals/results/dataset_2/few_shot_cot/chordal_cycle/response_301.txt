Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, 6, and node 1

1. Cycle <0, 5, 1, 7, 0>
2. Cycle <0, 5, 1, 9, 0>
3. Cycle <0, 5, 3, 7, 0>
4. Cycle <0, 5, 3, 6, 0>
5. Cycle <0, 5, 4, 8, 9, 0>
6. Cycle <1, 5, 4, 8, 9, 1>
7. Cycle <1, 7, 8, 9, 1>
8. Cycle <1, 7, 3, 6, 9, 1>
9. Cycle <3, 5, 4, 8, 9, 3>
  
Step 2:

1. Chordal 4-cycle <0, 5, 1, 7, 0> with chord (1, 7)
2. Chordal 4-cycle <0, 5, 3, 7, 0> with chord (3, 7)
3. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 5, 4, 8, 9, 1> with chord (4, 8)
4. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 7, 8, 9, 1> with chord (7, 8)
5. Chordal 4-cycle <3, 5, 4, 8, 9, 3> with chord (4, 8)

Step 3: 
Total number of chordless cycles found: [4]
