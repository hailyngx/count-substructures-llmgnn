Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 0) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 8) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 3) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 5) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 2) (7, 5) (7, 6) (7, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 8, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 0, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 6, 7, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 2, 1, 9, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 3, 4, 6, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 0, 8, 5)
- Cycle 5: (8, 0, 7, 6, 8)
- Cycle 6: (8, 0, 5, 2, 8)
- Cycle 7: (8, 3, 4, 6, 8)
- Cycle 8: (1, 9, 6, 4, 1)
- Cycle 9: (1, 9, 5, 2, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 2, 0, 7, 1)
- Cycle 11: (3, 5, 9, 6, 3)
- Cycle 12: (3, 5, 2, 1, 3)
- Cycle 13: (3, 4, 6, 9, 3)
- Cycle 14: (7, 5, 9, 6, 7)
- Cycle 15: (7, 5, 3, 4, 7)
- Cycle 16: (7, 6, 9, 1, 7)
- Cycle 17: (2, 5, 9, 1, 2)
- Cycle 18: (2, 5, 0, 8, 2)
- Cycle 19: (2, 1, 9, 6, 2)
- Cycle 20: (4, 6, 9, 1, 4)
- Cycle 21: (4, 6, 7, 0, 4)
- Cycle 22: (4, 8, 0, 7, 4)

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <1, (2, 4), 5>

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].
