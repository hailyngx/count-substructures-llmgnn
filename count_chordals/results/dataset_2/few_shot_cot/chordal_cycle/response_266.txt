Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph where every edge in the cycle exists:
<3, 4, 6, 7>
<1, 3, 5, 6>
<0, 3, 4, 7>
<1, 10, 5, 8>
<1, 11, 6, 13>
<9, 12, 5, 8>
<9, 14, 7, 4>
<3, 5, 12, 9>
<0, 4, 7, 14>
<3, 9, 12, 13>
<1, 10, 8, 2>
<1, 13, 12, 9>
<1, 14, 11, 6>
<5, 8, 10, 1>
<7, 14, 11, 6>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
<3, 4, (6, 7), 7>
<1, 3, (5, 6), 6>
<0, 3, (4, 7), 7>
<1, 10, (5, 8), 8>
<1, 11, (6, 13), 13>
<9, 12, (5, 8), 8>
<9, 14, (7, 4), 4>
<3, 5, (9, 12), 12>
<0, 4, (7, 14), 14>
<3, 9, (12, 13), 13>
<1, 10, (8, 2), 2>
<1, 13, (12, 9), 9>
<1, 14, (11, 6), 6>
<5, 8, (10, 1), 1>
<7, 14, (11, 6), 6>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
