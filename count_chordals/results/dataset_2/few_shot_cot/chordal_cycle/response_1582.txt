Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 8) (9, 1) (8, 7) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 5) (8, 0) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0)

Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 3, 4>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 8, 7>
- Cycle 5: <0, 3, 7, 4>
- Cycle 6: <0, 3, 6, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 7, 8>
- Cycle 8: <1, 4, 3, 7>
- Cycle 9: <1, 4, 7, 9>
- Cycle 10: <1, 4, 3, 0>
- Cycle 11: <1, 4, 3, 2>
- Cycle 12: <1, 5, 8, 7>
- Cycle 13: <2, 7, 3, 4>
- Cycle 14: <2, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 15: <2, 7, 8, 5>
- Cycle 16: <3, 4, 7, 8>
- Cycle 17: <3, 4, 7, 9>
- Cycle 18: <3, 4, 1, 6>
- Cycle 19: <3, 4, 1, 5>
- Cycle 20: <3, 6, 8, 5>
- Cycle 21: <3, 6, 8, 9>
- Cycle 22: <3, 0, 6, 1>
- Cycle 23: <3, 0, 6, 8>
- Cycle 24: <4, 7, 9, 8>
- Cycle 25: <5, 8, 7, 4>
- Cycle 26: <5, 8, 7, 9>
- Cycle 27: <6, 8, 7, 4>
- Cycle 28: <6, 8, 7, 9>
- Cycle 29: <7, 9, 8, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 6, 1, 4> has one chord: (6, 1)
- <0, 6, 1, 5> has one chord: (6, 1)
- <0, 3, 6, 1> has one chord: (3, 1)
- <1, 4, 7, 8> has one chord: (7, 4)
- <1, 4, 3, 7> has one chord: (7, 3)
- <1, 4, 7, 9> has one chord: (7, 9)
- <1, 5, 8, 7> has one chord: (8, 5)
- <2, 7, 8, 5> has one chord: (7, 8)
- <3, 4, 1, 6> has one chord: (1, 6)
- <3, 0, 6, 1> has one chord: (6, 1)
- <7, 9, 8, 5> has one chord: (8, 9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 11 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [11].
