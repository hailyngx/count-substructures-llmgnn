Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 6) (0, 2) (0, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 0) (2, 9) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 0) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 8, 6, 2, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, 0, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
1. <0, 1, 9, (0)>
2. <0, 8, 7, 9>
3. <1, 4, 7, 9>
4. <2, 4, 7, 9>
5. <3, 4, 7, 1>
6. <5, 1, 4, 7>
7. <0, 1, 5, 8>
8. <0, 6, 3, 4>
9. <2, 7, 4, 1>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
1. <0, 1, 9, (0)> - One chord (0)
2. <0, 8, 7, 9> - One chord (8)
3. <1, 4, 7, 9> - One chord (9)
4. <2, 4, 7, 9> - One chord (9)
5. <3, 4, 7, 1> - One chord (4)
6. <5, 1, 4, 7> - One chord (1)
7. <0, 1, 5, 8> - One chord (1)
8. <0, 6, 3, 4> - Chordless
9. <2, 7, 4, 1> - One chord (4)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
1 chordless cycle found.

Final count of chordal 4-cycles: [1]
Unique chordal 4-cycle: <0, 6, 3, 4>
