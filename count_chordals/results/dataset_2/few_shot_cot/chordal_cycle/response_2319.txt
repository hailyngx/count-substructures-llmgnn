Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 11, 7, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 5, 13, 11, 14, 2)
- Cycle 3: (3, 7, 12, 10, 3)
- Cycle 4: (4, 10, 3, 1, 5, 13, 11, 14, 8, 4)
- Cycle 5: (6, 9, 12, 14, 11, 7, 3, 10, 2, 6)
- Cycle 6: (8, 4, 10, 12, 14, 11, 13, 5, 1, 3, 10)
- Cycle 7: (9, 6, 1, 3, 10, 12, 14, 8, 9)
- Cycle 8: (0, 9, 6, 2, 5, 13, 11, 7, 0)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has chord <2, 11>.
- Cycle 6 has chord <1, 8>.
- Cycle 7 has chord <1, 12>.
- Cycle 8 has chord <5, 9>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 4 chordless cycles, so the answer is [4]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 5, 11, 7, 1>
- <2, 5, 13, 11, 14, 2>
- <3, 7, 12, 10, 3>
- <4, 10, 3, 1, 5, 13, 11, 14, 8, 4>
