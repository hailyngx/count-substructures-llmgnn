Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

<4, 7, 25, 1, 4>
<4, 27, 3, 29, 18, 4>
<7, 12, 24, 10, 8, 28, 20, 5, 19, 6, 19, 10, 24, 12, 7>
<13, 26, 25, 1, 8, 28, 20, 5, 0, 21, 25, 26, 13>
<7, 12, 24, 10, 19, 5, 0, 21, 25, 26, 18, 4, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
<7, (1, 25), 4>
<27, (3, 29), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are [2] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
