Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
1. <0, 1, 6, 4, 7, 3>
2. <0, 1, 4, 8, 6, 3>
3. <0, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9>
4. <0, 3, 7, 5, 9, 2>
5. <1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 2>
6. <2, 9, 5, 7, 4, 1>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 6, 4, 7, 3> has two chords: (1, 4) and (4, 7)
- <0, 1, 4, 8, 6, 3> has two chords: (1, 8) and (8, 6)
- <0, 1, 4, 7, 5, 9> has one chord: (1, 4) 
- <0, 3, 7, 5, 9, 2> has one chord: (3, 5)
- <1, 4, 7, 5, 9, 2> has one chord: (4, 7)
- <2, 9, 5, 7, 4, 1> has one chord: (2, 5)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is: [3]
