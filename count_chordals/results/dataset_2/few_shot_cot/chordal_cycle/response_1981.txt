Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 14, 5, 19> - Chord: (0, 5)
- <0, 25, 19, 16> - Chord: (19, 16)
- <1, 22, 23, 0> - Chord: (22, 23)
- <2, 8, 18, 6> - Chord: (8, 6)
- <3, 20, 24, 7> - Chord: (20, 24)
- <4, 19, 25, 29> - Chord: (19, 25)
- <5, 27, 21, 3> - Chord: (27, 21)
- <10, 16, 15, 25> - Chord: (16, 15)
- <13, 17, 11, 5> - Chord: (17, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [26]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [26].
