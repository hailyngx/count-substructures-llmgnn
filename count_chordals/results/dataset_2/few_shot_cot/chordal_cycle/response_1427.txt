Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 8) (6, 4) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 4) (0, 1) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) (1, 4) (4, 9) (4, 6) (4, 2) (4, 0) (4, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, 4, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 0, 7, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. Cycle: 0-9-7-1-0
2. Cycle: 0-9-4-1-0
3. Cycle: 0-9-5-2-0
4. Cycle: 1-2-5-9-1
5. Cycle: 1-2-4-0-1
6. Cycle: 1-7-9-5-1
7. Cycle: 2-5-9-4-2
8. Cycle: 2-5-3-6-2
9. Cycle: 2-1-0-4-2
10. Cycle: 3-5-9-6-3
11. Cycle: 3-7-9-0-3
12. Cycle: 3-8-6-8-3
13. Cycle: 4-9-6-8-4

Step 2:
Upon checking the cycles for exactly one chord, we find the unique chordal 4-cycle: 
<1, (2, 4), 5>

Step 3:
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the number of chordless cycles is [12].
