Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 5) (3, 8) (4, 1) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 8) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 7) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, 5, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 2, 5, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1:
