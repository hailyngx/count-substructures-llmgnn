Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 0, 3, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
<5, 9, 6, 3>
<5, 9, 1, 7>
<5, 9, 1, 3>
<5, 9, 1, 8>
<9, 6, 3, 4>
<9, 1, 7, 0>
<9, 1, 3, 7>
<9, 1, 8, 0>
<6, 3, 7, 0>
<1, 7, 0, 8>
<1, 3, 7, 0>
<1, 3, 6, 9>
<1, 3, 4, 2>
<1, 8, 0, 7>
<3, 6, 2, 5>
<3, 4, 2, 5>
<3, 7, 0, 8>
<3, 7, 2, 5>
<3, 0, 7, 1>
<2, 5, 8, 0>
<2, 4, 3, 6>
<2, 7, 0, 8>
<2, 0, 8, 5>
<8, 5, 2, 7>
<8, 1, 7, 0>
<8, 0, 7, 3>
<0, 7, 2, 5>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <1, 3, 4, 2> has a chord between 3 and 2. 
- The cycle <1, 3, 6, 9> has a chord between 3 and 6.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 2 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
