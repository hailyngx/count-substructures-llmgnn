Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 20, 10, 27, 26, 4, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 20, 10, 27, 26, 16, 2>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 26, 27, 14, 20, 10, 27>
- Cycle 4: <2, 25, 23, 8, 29, 16, 26, 4>
- Cycle 5: <2, 25, 3, 7, 17, 28, 12, 29>
- Cycle 6: <3, 25, 23, 8, 15, 9, 0, 13>
- Cycle 7: <4, 1, 19, 22, 21, 8, 15, 7>
- Cycle 8: <5, 20, 14, 1, 4, 26, 16, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (26, 27)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (26, 27)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (10, 27)
- Cycle 4 has a chord: (2, 25)
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (3, 25)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (0, 13)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (22, 21)
- Cycle 8 no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the count is [6].
