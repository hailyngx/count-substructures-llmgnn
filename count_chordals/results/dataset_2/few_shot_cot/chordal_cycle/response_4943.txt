Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <4, 13, 14, 7> and the chord is (4, 7).

Following the steps mentioned earlier:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 4-7-15-1-5-13-4 (length 6)
- Cycle 2: 4-13-17-16-12-4 (length 5)
- Cycle 3: 4-12-16-17-13-4 (length 5)
- Cycle 4: 4-7-19-12-16-4 (length 5)
- Cycle 5: 13-17-16-12-4-13 (length 5)
- Cycle 6: 7-15-1-10-2-18-6-5-13-7 (length 9)
- Cycle 7: 7-15-1-10-2-18-9-0-16-17-13-7 (length 11)
- Cycle 8: 13-4-7-19-12-16-17-13 (length 7)
- Cycle 9: 16-17-13-5-6-18-9-0-16 (length 8)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 1: 4-13-14-7-4 has exactly one chord (4, 7).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is [0].
