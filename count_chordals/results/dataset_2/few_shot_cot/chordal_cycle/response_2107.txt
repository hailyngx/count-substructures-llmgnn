Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 3) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (8, 9) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 7) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 0, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Possible 4-cycles are <7, 5, 4, 1>, <5, 4 7, 0>, <4, 1, 2, 5>, <5, 6, 9, 2>, <4, 3, 1, 2>, <6, 3, 0, 7>, <4, 3, 9, 8>, <6, 3, 9, 8>, <2, 1, 3, 9>, <9, 8, 3, 4>, and many more.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <7, 5, 4, 1> has a chord (1, 4).
- <5, 4, 7, 0> has a chord (0, 5).
- <4, 1, 2, 5> has a chord (1, 5).
- <5, 6, 9, 2> has a chord (6, 9).
- <4, 3, 1, 2> has a chord (1, 2).
- <6, 3, 0, 7> has a chord (0, 3).
- <4, 3, 9, 8> has a chord (3, 9).
- <6, 3, 9, 8> has a chord (3, 8).
- <2, 1, 3, 9> has a chord (1, 9).
- <9, 8, 3, 4> has a chord (3, 4).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord.

Therefore, the final answer is [10].
