Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <1, 11, 4, 5, 1>
- <1, 11, 12, 8, 2, 1>
- <1, 2, 13, 11, 12, 1>
- <2, 8, 11, 4, 2>
- <2, 13, 3, 5, 6, 10, 14, 4, 2>
- <3, 5, 4, 6, 10, 3>
- <3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 6, 3>
- <3, 7, 9, 10, 6, 3>
- <4, 5, 6, 10, 14, 4>
- <5, 6, 10, 3, 7, 5>
- <6, 10, 14, 4, 5, 6>
- <7, 9, 10, 6, 5, 7>
- <8, 11, 4, 2, 8>
- <8, 11, 12, 9, 10, 6, 5, 7, 8>
- <9, 10, 6, 5, 7, 9>
- <9, 10, 12, 11, 13, 9>
- <10, 12, 11, 4, 5, 6, 10>
- <11, 13, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 11>
- <12, 9, 7, 5, 4, 11, 12>
- <13, 11, 2, 8, 7, 5, 6, 10, 14, 13>

Step 2: 
The chordal 4-cycle is: <3, (6, 10), 14, 4> with chord (6, 10).

Step 3: 
There is 1 chordless cycle found, so the final count is [1].
