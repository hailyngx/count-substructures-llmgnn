Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 3) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 6) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 6) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 1, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 6, 3>
- Cycle 3: <2, 9, 1, 7>
- Cycle 4: <2, 9, 6, 3>
- Cycle 5: <4, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 6: <4, 5, 7, 2>
- Cycle 7: <4, 7, 2, 3>
- Cycle 8: <5, 8, 3, 4>
- Cycle 9: <6, 9, 1, 7>
- Cycle 10: <6, 9, 2, 3>
- Cycle 11: <7, 1, 9, 6>
- Cycle 12: <7, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 13: <7, 5, 4, 8>
- Cycle 14: <7, 5, 4, 3>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- <2, 9, 1, 7> has a chord (9, 1)
- <2, 9, 6, 3> has a chord (9, 3)
- <4, 5, 8, 3> has a chord (5, 8)
- <4, 5, 7, 2> has a chord (5, 7)
- <6, 9, 2, 3> has a chord (9, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 

As there are no chordless cycles found, the final count is [0].
