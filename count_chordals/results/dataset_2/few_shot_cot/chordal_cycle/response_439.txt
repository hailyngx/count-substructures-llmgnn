Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 5, 12, 7>
2. <0, 1, 5, 12, 8>
3. <0, 8, 7, 12, 5>
4. <1, 5, 12, 7, 8>
5. <2, 6, 10, 0, 8>
6. <2, 6, 10, 0, 1>
7. <2, 6, 10, 13, 9>
8. <2, 6, 10, 13, 12>
9. <2, 8, 7, 12, 13>
10. <2, 8, 12, 5, 1>
11. <3, 7, 12, 5, 1>
12. <3, 7, 12, 8, 5>
13. <3, 11, 14, 4, 6>
14. <3, 11, 14, 10, 0>
15. <4, 14, 11, 3, 7>
16. <5, 12, 7, 8, 1>
17. <6, 10, 0, 8, 2>
18. <7, 9, 13, 12, 5>
19. <8, 0, 10, 6, 2>
20. <8, 0, 10, 13, 12>
21. <8, 1, 5, 12, 7>
22. <10, 6, 2, 8, 0>
23. <10, 6, 4, 14, 11>
24. <10, 13, 9, 7, 12>
25. <10, 13, 12, 7, 3>
26. <11, 14, 4, 6, 2>
27. <12, 7, 3, 4, 6>
28. <13, 9, 0, 10, 14>

Step 2: 
- Out of the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <4, 14, 11, 3> with chord (4, 3)
2. <8, 1, 5, 12> with chord (1, 12)
3. <10, 6, 2, 8> with chord (6, 8)
4. <10, 13, 9, 7> with chord (9, 7)

Step 3:
- There are 4 unique chordal 4-cycles found.
- Therefore, the final count of chordless cycles is [25].
