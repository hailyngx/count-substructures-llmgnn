Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph, namely:
- Cycle 1: <0, 10, 14, 6>
- Cycle 2: <1, 2, 7, 9>
- Cycle 3: <2, 4, 13, 5>
- Cycle 4: <4, 13, 6, 14>
- Cycle 5: <7, 10, 14, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Out of the cycles listed above, only Cycle 3: <2, 4, 13, 5> has exactly one chord which is the edge (2, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

As there is only one cycle with exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <2, 4, 13, 5>.
