- <0, 6, 13, 5>
- <0, 3, 12, 11>
- <0, 3, 2, 14>

- <13, 12, 6, 7>
- <14, 4, 7, 0>
- <14, 8, 9, 7>
- <14, 10, 5, 13>
- <14, 11, 12, 6>
- <14, 2, 3, 0>

Cycles of length 5:
- <0, 6, 1, 8, 5>
- <0, 3, 12, 6, 13>
- <4, 7, 0, 3, 12>
- <4, 13, 6, 7, 9>

Cycles of length 6:
- <0, 7, 9, 8, 5, 13>
- <4, 13, 5, 8, 9, 7>
- <5, 13, 6, 7, 9, 8>
- <8, 5, 13, 6, 12, 11>
- <12, 11, 14, 4, 7, 0>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, 7, 9, 8, 5, 13> has one chord (5, 8)
- <4, 13, 5, 8, 9, 7> has one chord (5, 9)
- <5, 13, 6, 7, 9, 8> has one chord (6, 9)
- <8, 5, 13, 6, 12, 11> has one chord (5, 6)
- <12, 11, 14, 4, 7, 0> has one chord (11, 14)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 32 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [32].
