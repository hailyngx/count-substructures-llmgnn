Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 0) (2, 3) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the given graph. We will list them down below:
1. Cycle 1: (0, 8, 4, 9, 6)
2. Cycle 2: (1, 9, 5, 2, 0)
3. Cycle 3: (2, 5, 3, 4, 1)
4. Cycle 4: (3, 4, 9, 6, 0)
5. Cycle 5: (3, 4, 1, 7, 9)
6. Cycle 6: (3, 8, 4, 9, 5)
7. Cycle 7: (4, 8, 6, 9, 5)
8. Cycle 8: (5, 2, 0, 6, 8)
9. Cycle 9: (5, 9, 4, 3, 7)
10. Cycle 10: (6, 8, 0, 2, 5)
11. Cycle 11: (7, 9, 5, 2, 0)
12. Cycle 12: (8, 6, 0, 2, 5)
13. Cycle 13: (9, 4, 1, 7, 3)

Step 2:
Now, we will check each of these cycles for exactly one chord:
1. Cycle 1 has a chord (8, 6) 
2. Cycle 2 has a chord (9, 1)
3. Cycle 3 has a chord (5, 3)
4. Cycle 4 has a chord (4, 6)
5. Cycle 5 has a chord (4, 7)
6. Cycle 6 has a chord (8, 5)
7. Cycle 7 is a chordal 4-cycle with chord (4, 5) - <7, (4, 5), 9>
8. Cycle 8 has a chord (6, 8)
9. Cycle 9 has a chord (9, 3)
10. Cycle 10 has a chord (8, 6)
11. Cycle 11 has a chord (9, 5)
12. Cycle 12 has a chord (8, 6)
13. Cycle 13 has a chord (4, 7)

Step 3:
There are 7 chordless cycles found in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 8, 4, 9, 6)
- Cycle 2: (1, 9, 5, 2, 0)
- Cycle 3: (2, 5, 3, 4, 1)
- Cycle 10: (5, 4, 3, 8, 0)
- Cycle 11: (4, 8, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 13: (7, 9, 5, 2, 0)
- Cycle 14: (8, 6, 0, 2, 5)

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [7].
