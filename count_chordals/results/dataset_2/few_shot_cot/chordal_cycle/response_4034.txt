Response:
Step 1: 
- There are four cycles of length 4 in the graph: <0, 7, 8, 3>, <1, 5, 13, 2>, <1, 5, 10, 12>, and <4, 15, 1, 10>

Step 2:
- The cycle <0, 7, 8, 3> has one chord: edge (7, 8)
- The cycle <1, 5, 13, 2> has no chords
- The cycle <1, 5, 10, 12> has no chords
- The cycle <4, 15, 1, 10> has one chord: edge (1, 10)

Step 3:
- The total number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2]
- The unique chordal 4-cycles found are <0, 7, 8, (3)> and <4, 15, 1, (10)>
