- Cycle (0, 4, 9, 14, 1, 5) has the chord (9, 14)
- Cycle (0, 4, 9, 14, 2, 5) has the chord (9, 14)
- Cycle (0, 6, 5, 8, 7, 3) has the chord (5, 7)
- Cycle (0, 6, 5, 12, 13, 4) has the chord (5, 13)
- Cycle (0, 6, 5, 2, 9, 4) has the chord (6, 4)
- Cycle (0, 7, 4, 9, 2, 3) has the chord (4, 2)
- Cycle (1, 5, 6, 13, 12, 11) has the chord (6, 12)
- Cycle (1, 5, 2, 9, 4, 7) has the chord (5, 9)
- Cycle (1, 3, 7, 8, 13, 12) has the chord (7, 8)
- Cycle (1, 14, 9, 4, 7, 3) has the chord (14, 4)

- Cycle (2, 3, 7, 8, 13, 12) has the chord (3, 8)
- Cycle (3, 7, 4, 13, 12, 11) has the chord (7, 4)
- Cycle (4, 9, 2, 5, 6, 13) has the chord (9, 6)
- Cycle (4, 13, 12, 5, 8, 0) has the chord (13, 5)
- Cycle (5, 12, 13, 10, 6, 14) has the chord (12, 6)
- Cycle (6, 14, 9, 11, 12, 13) has the chord (9, 12)
- Cycle (7, 8, 13, 12, 11, 9) has the chord (8, 11)
