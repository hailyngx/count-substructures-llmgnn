Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
- (6, 9, 14, 5, 6)
- (9, 11, 7, 12, 9)
- (6, 4, 0, 10, 6)
- (0, 9, 10, 12, 0)
- (9, 14, 1, 13, 9)
- (3, 14, 1, 13, 3)
- (2, 8, 1, 13, 2)
- (8, 3, 14, 1, 8)
- (12, 10, 0, 4, 12)
- (7, 11, 9, 6, 7)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
- <6, (9, 14), 5, 6>
- <9, (11, 7), 12, 9>
- <6, (4, 0), 10, 6>
- <0, (9, 10), 12, 0>
- <9, (14, 1), 13, 9>
- <3, (14, 1), 13, 3>
- <2, (8, 1), 13, 2>
- <8, (3, 14), 1, 8>
- <12, (10, 0), 4, 12>
- <7, (11, 9), 6, 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
