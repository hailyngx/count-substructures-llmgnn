Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 0) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle <0, 3, 5, 9>
- Cycle <1, 0, 3, 9>
- Cycle <1, 0, 8, 9>
- Cycle <1, 4, 7, 8>
- Cycle <1, 7, 8, 9>
- Cycle <2, 3, 5, 9>
- Cycle <2, 3, 8, 9>
- Cycle <2, 4, 6, 7>
- Cycle <2, 4, 7, 8>
- Cycle <6, 4, 7, 8>
- Cycle <7, 1, 4, 6>
- Cycle <7, 1, 4, 7>
- Cycle <7, 1, 8, 9>
- Cycle <7, 2, 4, 6>
- Cycle <7, 2, 4, 7>
- Cycle <7, 2, 3, 8>
- Cycle <8, 0, 1, 4>
- Cycle <8, 0, 1, 7>
- Cycle <8, 0, 3, 2>
- Cycle <8, 0, 3, 5>
- Cycle <8, 1, 4, 7>
- Cycle <8, 1, 7, 4>
- Cycle <8, 1, 7, 8>
- Cycle <8, 3, 2, 4>
- Cycle <8, 3, 2, 7>
- Cycle <8, 7, 1, 4>
- Cycle <9, 0, 1, 4>
- Cycle <9, 0, 3, 2>
- Cycle <9, 0, 3, 5>
- Cycle <9, 1, 4, 7>
- Cycle <9, 1, 7, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <1, (4, 7), 8>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 30 chordless 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [30].
