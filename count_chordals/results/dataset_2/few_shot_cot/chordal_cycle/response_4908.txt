Response:
Step 1: 
Potential cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: (4, 9, 5, 21) (contains edge (5, 21))
- Cycle 2: (21, 5, 9, 4) (contains edge (5, 9))
- Cycle 3: (26, 17, 28, 24) (contains edge (28, 24))
- Cycle 4: (28, 24, 10, 25) (contains edge (24, 10))
- Cycle 5: (9, 5, 21, 20) (contains edge (5, 21))
- Cycle 6: (16, 0, 22, 26) (contains edge (0, 16))
- Cycle 7: (28, 17, 26, 22) (contains edge (17, 26))
- Cycle 8: (26, 22, 16, 0) (contains edge (22, 16))
- Cycle 9: (7, 9, 5, 21) (contains edge (9, 5))
- Cycle 10: (2, 12, 1, 27) (contains edge (12, 1))
- Cycle 11: (22, 26, 4, 21) (contains edge (26, 4))

Step 2:
Identifying chordal 4-cycles:
- <4, 14, 9, 5> (Chord: (9, 5))
- <5, 9, 7, 27> (Chord: (9, 7))
- <9, 5, 21, 20> (Chord: (5, 21))
- <16, 0, 22, 26> (Chord: (0, 16))
- <26, 22, 16, 0> (Chord: (22, 16))

Step 3:
There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
