Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: (1, 4, 9, 8, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 3, 14, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 18, 11, 14, 1)
- Cycle 4: (2, 17, 11, 14, 2)
- Cycle 5: (2, 13, 6, 17, 2)
- Cycle 6: (3, 15, 5, 16, 3)
- Cycle 7: (3, 14, 11, 17, 3)
- Cycle 8: (4, 0, 8, 9, 4)
- Cycle 9: (5, 16, 12, 5)
- Cycle 10: (6, 17, 11, 14, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 19, 14, 3, 6)
- Cycle 12: (7, 13, 2, 17, 7)
- Cycle 13: (8, 18, 11, 17, 8)
- Cycle 14: (9, 14, 3, 15, 9)
- Cycle 15: (13, 10, 6, 17, 13)
- Cycle 16: (14, 11, 17, 2, 14)
- Cycle 17: (16, 12, 5, 15, 16)
- Cycle 18: (17, 11, 14, 3, 17)
- Cycle 19: (18, 8, 0, 4, 18)
- Cycle 20: (19, 14, 3, 15, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (4, 9), 8)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (3, 14), 5)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (11, 14), 18)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <2, (11, 14), 17)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <2, (6, 17), 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <6, (14, 3), 17)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <6, (14, 19), 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <7, (2, 17), 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <8, (11, 17), 18)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <14, (3, 15), 9)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <13, (6, 17), 10)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 19: <14, (11, 17), 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 20: <16, (5, 15), 12)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 21: <17, (3, 14), 11)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 22: <18, (0, 8), 4)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 23: <19, (3, 14), 15)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. 
There are 20 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph. Hence, the final count is [20].
