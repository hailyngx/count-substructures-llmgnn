Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <5, 6, 10, 0, 9>
2. <5, 14, 9, 7, 5>
3. <5, 14, 1, 2, 5>
4. <9, 3, 0, 6, 9>
5. <9, 7, 8, 1, 14>
6. <10, 11, 4, 2, 10>
7. <10, 0, 9, 3, 10>
8. <10, 1, 2, 4, 10>
9. <11, 8, 1, 2, 11>
10. <11, 4, 12, 7, 1>
11. <13, 3, 0, 6, 13>
12. <13, 6, 10, 0, 13>
13. <6, 5, 14, 9, 6>
14. <6, 0, 9, 7, 6>
15. <0, 9, 7, 8, 0>
16. <0, 3, 14, 1, 0>
17. <0, 3, 9, 7, 0>
18. <0, 12, 4, 2, 0>
19. <14, 5, 6, 0, 14>
20. <14, 9, 3, 12, 14>
21. <14, 1, 7, 12, 14>
22. <7, 5, 6, 0, 7>
23. <7, 9, 14, 5, 7>
24. <7, 8, 11, 10, 7>
25. <7, 12, 4, 2, 7>
26. <12, 0, 9, 14, 12>
27. <12, 7, 8, 1, 12>
28. <12, 4, 2, 1, 12>
29. <4, 10, 1, 2, 4>
30. <4, 11, 8, 7, 4> 
31. <4, 12, 7, 9, 4>
32. <2, 5, 6, 13, 2>
33. <3, 9, 14, 1, 3>
34. <3, 13, 6, 0, 3>
35. <3, 0, 10, 6, 3>
36. <3, 14, 1, 7, 3>
37. <3, 12, 4, 2, 3>
38. <1, 10, 11, 8, 1>

Step 2: 
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <9, 7, 8, 1, 14> (Chord: 8, 14)
2. <11, 8, 1, 2, 11> (Chord: 1, 2)
3. <0, 3, 14, 1, 0> (Chord: 14, 1)
4. <14, 1, 7, 12, 14> (Chord: 1, 7)
5. <12, 7, 8, 1, 12> (Chord: 7, 8)

Step 3: 
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [5].
