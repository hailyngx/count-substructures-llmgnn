Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 3, 13, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 2, 13, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 8, 3, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 13, 3, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 5, 4, 2, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 13, 12, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 10, 14, 9, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 7, 1, 8, 2>
- Cycle 9: <4, 6, 10, 2, 4>
- Cycle 10: <4, 6, 8, 12, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 5, 12, 10, 4>
- Cycle 12: <5, 12, 13, 3, 5>
- Cycle 13: <5, 0, 1, 2, 5>
- Cycle 14: <6, 10, 14, 2, 6>
- Cycle 15: <7, 1, 8, 12, 7>
- Cycle 16: <9, 11, 3, 1, 9>
- Cycle 17: <9, 11, 12, 5, 9>
- Cycle 18: <9, 14, 10, 6, 9>
- Cycle 19: <10, 6, 4, 5, 10>
- Cycle 20: <11, 3, 8, 12, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycles: <0, (1, 13), 3, 0>, <0, (1, 2), 13, 0>, <0, (1, 8), 3, 0>, <0, (9, 13), 3, 0>, <0, (12, 5), 4, 2, 0>, <1, (3, 12), 13, 1>, <2, (10, 9), 14, 2>, <2, (7, 8), 1, 2>, <4, (6, 10), 2, 4>, <4, (8, 12), 6, 4>, <4, (5, 12), 10, 4>, <5, (0, 1), 2, 5>, <6, (10, 14), 2, 6>, <7, (8, 12), 1, 7>, <9, (11, 12), 13, 9>, <9, (14, 6), 10, 9>, <10, (4, 5), 12, 10>, <11, (3, 8), 12, 11>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [2]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found are:

<0, (1, 13), 3, 0>
<0, (1, 2), 13, 0>
