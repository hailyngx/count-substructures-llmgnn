Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 0) (6, 2) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 2, 3, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more with all edges existing in the graph:
- <0, 5, 4, 1, 0>
- <0, 5, 8, 9, 4, 5, 0>
- <1, 4, 3, 9, 8, 5, 4, 1>
- <2, 1, 4, 3, 0, 7, 9, 2>
- <2, 3, 0, 5, 8, 9, 2>
- <2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 5, 0, 2>
- <2, 7, 0, 5, 4, 1, 3, 2>
- <3, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 4, 3>
- <4, 5, 8, 9, 4>
- <7, 0, 5, 8, 9, 7>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 5, 4, 1, 0> has a chord (4, 1)
- <0, 5, 8, 9, 4, 5, 0> has a chord (9, 8)
- <1, 4, 3, 9, 8, 5, 4, 1> has a chord (9, 3)
- <2, 1, 4, 3, 0, 7, 9, 2> has a chord (1, 9)
- <2, 3, 0, 5, 8, 9, 2> has a chord (3, 8)
- <2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 5, 0, 2> has a chord (4, 0)
- <2, 7, 0, 5, 4, 1, 3, 2> has a chord (0, 4)
- <3, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 4, 3> has a chord (1, 5)
- <4, 5, 8, 9, 4> has a chord (5, 9)
- <7, 0, 5, 8, 9, 7> has a chord (0, 5)

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles = [10]
