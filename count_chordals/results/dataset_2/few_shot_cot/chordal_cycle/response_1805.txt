- Cycle 10: 2-19-4-15-2
- Cycle 11: 2-6-14-5-2
- Cycle 12: 4-8-9-10-4
- Cycle 13: 4-8-0-12-4

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has one chord (8-4) <0, (8,4), 2>
- Cycle 2 has one chord (8-0) <0, (8,0), 4>
- Cycle 3 has one chord (13-7) <1, (13,7), 17>
- Cycle 5 has one chord (7-19) <1, (7,19), 6>
- Cycle 11 has one chord (14-5) <2, (14,5), 6>
- Cycle 12 has one chord (8-10) <4, (8,10), 9>
- Cycle 13 has one chord (8-12) <4, (8,12), 0>
- Cycle 15 has one chord (9-16) <4, (9,16), 10>
- Cycle 16 has one chord (9-18) <4, (9,18), 2>
- Cycle 17 has one chord (3-14) <5, (3,14), 6>
- Cycle 18 has one chord (3-16) <5, (3,16), 14>
- Cycle 19 has one chord (9-8) <6, (9,8), 2>
- Cycle 20 has one chord (9-18) <6, (9,18), 2>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found = [9]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, (8,4), 2>
<0, (8,0), 4>
<1, (13,7), 17>
<1, (7,19), 6>
<2, (14,5), 6>
<4, (8,10), 9>
<4, (8,12), 0>
<4, (9,16), 10>
<5, (3,14), 6>
