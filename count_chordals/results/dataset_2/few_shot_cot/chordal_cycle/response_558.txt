Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, such as:
1. <0, 1, 3, 15>
2. <0, 1, 2, 11>
3. <0, 1, 3, 17>
4. <0, 4, 9, 14>
5. <2, 8, 13, 15>
6. <2, 11, 12, 0>
7. <2, 9, 4, 17>
8. <3, 13, 16, 6>
9. <3, 15, 4, 17>
10. <4, 9, 14, 6>
11. <8, 13, 15, 4>
12. <8, 9, 4, 17>
13. <10, 17, 3, 16>
14. <10, 19, 18, 7>
15. <13, 15, 4, 0>
16. <13, 16, 6, 14>
17. <14, 9, 4, 0>
18. <15, 3, 17, 10>
19. <15, 4, 0, 1>
20. <18, 2, 1, 3>
21. <18, 7, 18, 9>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the cycle <0, 1, 3, 15> has exactly one chord which is the edge (3, 15), making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [20].
