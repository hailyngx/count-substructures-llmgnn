Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph. Let's list them: 
1. <0, 4, 11, 0>
2. <0, 7, 5, 4>
3. <0, 7, 9, 1>
4. <0, 11, 6, 13>
5. <1, 9, 8, 4>
6. <2, 4, 11, 6>
7. <2, 9, 13, 6>
8. <3, 6, 13, 8>
9. <4, 5, 7, 0>
10. <4, 8, 13, 6>
11. <4, 11, 6, 3>
12. <7, 1, 9, 8>
13. <11, 13, 8, 4>
14. <12, 8, 13, 11>
15. <13, 6, 3, 10>
16. <13, 8, 4, 11>

Step 2: 
Let's check each of these cycles for exactly one chord:
1. <0, 4, 11, 0> has no chord.
2. <0, 7, 5, 4> has no chord.
3. <0, 7, 9, 1> has no chord.
4. <0, 11, 6, 13> has no chord.
5. <1, 9, 8, 4> has no chord.
6. <2, 4, 11, 6> has a chord: (2, 6).
7. <2, 9, 13, 6> has a chord: (2, 13).
8. <3, 6, 13, 8> has no chord.
9. <4, 5, 7, 0> has no chord.
10. <4, 8, 13, 6> has no chord.
11. <4, 11, 6, 3> has no chord.
12. <7, 1, 9, 8> has no chord.
13. <11, 13, 8, 4> has no chord.
14. <12, 8, 13, 11> has no chord.
15. <13, 6, 3, 10> has no chord.
16. <13, 8, 4, 11> has no chord.

Step 3: 
The unique chordal 4-cycle is <2, 4, 11, 6> with a chord (2, 6).
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [15].
