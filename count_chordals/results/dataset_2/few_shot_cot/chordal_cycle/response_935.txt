Node 3 is connected to node 1, 7, 4, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
<0, 5, 4, 9>
<0, 5, 8, 7>
<1, 6, 5, 0>
<1, 6, 5, 4>
<1, 2, 4, 5>
<1, 2, 7, 8>
<2, 4, 5, 8>
<2, 4, 3, 1>
<2, 7, 8, 5>
<2, 7, 9, 4>
<3, 1, 6, 5>
<3, 1, 0, 7>
<3, 4, 5, 8>
<3, 4, 2, 7>
<4, 5, 6, 1>
<4, 5, 8, 3>
<4, 9, 7, 3>
<4, 9, 5, 0>
<5, 6, 1, 0>
<5, 6, 0, 7>
<5, 8, 3, 1>
<5, 8, 7, 2>
<6, 1, 3, 7>
<6, 1, 0, 5>
<7, 9, 5, 8>
<7, 9, 4, 2>
<7, 3, 1, 6>
<7, 3, 4, 2>
<8, 5, 4, 9>
<8, 5, 0, 1>
<8, 7, 3, 1>
<8, 7, 2, 4>
<9, 5, 4, 2>
<9, 5, 0, 7>

Step 2: Checking for one chord:
<0, 5, 4, 9>, chord: (5, 4)     <0, 5, 8, 7>, chord: (5, 8)
<1, 2, 4, 5>, chord: (2, 5)     <1, 2, 7, 8>, chord: (2, 7)
<3, 4, 5, 8>, chord: (4, 8)     <3, 4, 2, 7>, chord: (4, 7)
<4, 5, 6, 1>, chord: (5, 6)     <4, 5, 8, 3>, chord: (5, 3)
<7, 3, 1, 6>, chord: (3, 1)     <7, 3, 4, 2>, chord: (3, 4)

Step 3: Counting chordal 4-cycles:
