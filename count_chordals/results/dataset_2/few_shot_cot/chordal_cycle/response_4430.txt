Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: (3, 15, 18, 6)
- Cycle 2: (3, 15, 13, 16)
- Cycle 3: (3, 8, 1, 7)
- Cycle 4: (3, 8, 9, 4)
- Cycle 5: (3, 15, 18, 11)
- Cycle 6: (15, 13, 15, 3)
- Cycle 7: (15, 18, 6, 11)
- Cycle 8: (14, 17, 5, 19)
- Cycle 9: (14, 17, 0, 9)
- Cycle 10: (14, 12, 9, 4)
- Cycle 11: (14, 19, 10, 7)
- Cycle 12: (17, 5, 19, 10)
- Cycle 13: (1, 8, 3, 15)
- Cycle 14: (1, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 15: (8, 9, 12, 16)
- Cycle 16: (13, 15, 18, 6)
- Cycle 17: (4, 9, 8, 3)
- Cycle 18: (2, 5, 17, 14)
- Cycle 19: (18, 11, 6, 19)
- Cycle 20: (5, 16, 3, 15)
- Cycle 21: (19, 16, 12, 9)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycle: 
- <3, (3, 15), 16>

Step 3:
As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [1].
