Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: (1, 11, 4, 3, 7, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 1, 8, 16, 6, 2)
- Cycle 3: (3, 4, 11, 9, 8, 3)
- Cycle 4: (5, 10, 17, 8, 1, 5)
- Cycle 5: (6, 16, 8, 13, 17, 6)
- Cycle 6: (7, 1, 8, 17, 15, 7)
- Cycle 7: (0, 12, 10, 5, 14, 0)
- Cycle 8: (14, 16, 8, 1, 2, 14)
- Cycle 9: (18, 14, 2, 5, 0, 18)
- Cycle 10: (19, 15, 17, 10, 12, 19)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (9, 8), 3, 11, 4> with the chord (9, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (16, 6), 8, 1, 2> with the chord (16, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, (17, 8), 1, 10, 5> with the chord (17, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <6, (13, 17), 8, 16, 6> with the chord (13, 17)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <7, (15, 17), 1, 3, 7> with the chord (15, 17)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <0, (12, 10), 5, 14, 0> with the chord (12, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <14, (2, 5), 18, 16, 14> with the chord (2, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 7 unique chordal 4-cycles found, therefore the number of chordless cycles is [3].
