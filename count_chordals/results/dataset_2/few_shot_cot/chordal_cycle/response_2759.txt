Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle: <11, 16, 10, 8, 11>
- Cycle: <11, 16, 9, 13, 12, 5, 4, 6, 1, 14, 0, 11>
- Cycle: <11, 16, 18, 7, 19, 15, 14, 1, 6, 4, 2, 17, 13, 9, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycle: <11, 16, 10, 8, 11> has one chord: (10, 8)
- Chordal cycle: <11, 16, 9, 13, 12, 5, 4, 6, 1, 14, 0, 11> has one chord: (1, 14)
- Chordal cycle: <11, 16, 18, 7, 19, 15, 14, 1, 6, 4, 2, 17, 13, 9, 11> has one chord: (6, 2)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are [0] chordless cycles found in the graph.
