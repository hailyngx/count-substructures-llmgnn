Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, 6, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 1, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 3, 9, 4, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 2, 5, 1>
- Cycle 6: <2, 5, 4, 9, 2>
- Cycle 7: <2, 8, 0, 7, 2>
- Cycle 8: <3, 9, 4, 0, 3>
- Cycle 9: <4, 5, 2, 8, 4>
- Cycle 10: <5, 7, 0, 3, 5>
- Cycle 11: <6, 7, 0, 3, 6>
- Cycle 12: <7, 0, 4, 9, 7>
- Cycle 13: <8, 1, 3, 0, 8>
- Cycle 14: <9, 3, 1, 6, 9>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Checking cycle 1 <0, 3, 1, 6, 0>:
    - Chord: (3, 6) -> <0, (3, 6), 1>
- Checking cycle 2 <0, 3, 8, 0>:
    - Chord: (3, 8) -> <0, (3, 8), 0>
- Checking cycle 3 <0, 4, 5, 7, 0>:
    - Chord: (4, 5) -> <0, (4, 5), 7>
- Checking cycle 4 <1, 3, 9, 4, 1>:
    - Chord: (3, 4) -> <1, (3, 4), 9>
- Checking cycle 5 <1, 6, 2, 5, 1>:
    - Chord: (6, 2) -> <1, (6, 2), 5>
- Checking cycle 6 <2, 5, 4, 9, 2>:
    - Chord: (5, 4) -> <2, (5, 4), 9>
- Checking cycle 7 <2, 8, 0, 7, 2>:
    - Chord: (8, 7) -> <2, (8, 7), 0>
- Checking cycle 8 <3, 9, 4, 0, 3>:
    - Chord: (9, 4) -> <3, (9, 4), 0>
- Checking cycle 9 <4, 5, 2, 8, 4>:
    - Chord: (5, 2) -> <4, (5, 2), 8>
- Checking cycle 10 <5, 7, 0, 3, 5>:
    - Chord: (7, 3) -> <5, (7, 3), 0>
  
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 10 chordless cycles found, so the final count is [10].
