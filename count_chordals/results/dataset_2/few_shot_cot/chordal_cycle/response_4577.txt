The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 4, 11, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 6, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 11, 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 8, 11, 1>
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 5, 7, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 4, 1, 6, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 8, 10, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 4, 11, 0, 2>
- Cycle 10: <2, 6, 5, 7, 2>
- Cycle 11: <3, 5, 7, 13, 3>
- Cycle 12: <3, 10, 8, 4, 3>
- Cycle 13: <3, 10, 12, 0, 3>
- Cycle 14: <4, 8, 10, 12, 4>
- Cycle 15: <5, 6, 1, 4, 5>
- Cycle 16: <5, 13, 7, 14, 5>
- Cycle 17: <7, 5, 3, 10, 7>
- Cycle 18: <8, 4, 1, 6, 8>
- Cycle 19: <8, 4, 10, 12, 8>
- Cycle 20: <8, 9, 2, 6, 8>
- Cycle 21: <10, 3, 5, 7, 10>
- Cycle 22: <10, 8, 4, 11, 10>
- Cycle 23: <12, 0, 1, 6, 12>
- Cycle 24: <12, 0, 11, 4, 12>
- Cycle 25: <12, 10, 8, 14, 12>
- Cycle 26: <13, 5, 7, 14, 13>
- Cycle 27: <13, 10, 12, 0, 13>
- Cycle 28: <14, 9, 8, 4, 14>
- Cycle 29: <14, 9, 2, 6, 14>
- Cycle 30: <14, 7, 5, 6, 14>

Step 2: Checking for chorded cycles:

Out of the cycles listed above, the cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
- <0, 1, 4, 11, 0> with chord (4, 8)
- <0, 1, 4, 8, 0> with chord (1, 11)
- <0, 1, 6, 5, 0> with chord (1, 4)
- <0, 11, 4, 8, 0> with chord (0, 12)
- <1, 4, 8, 11, 1> with chord (4, 8)
- <1, 6, 5, 7, 1> with chord (5, 13)
- <2, 4, 1, 6, 2> with chord (4, 8)
- <2, 4, 8, 10, 2> with chord (4, 11)
- <2, 6, 5, 7, 2> with chord (5, 13)
- <3, 5, 7, 13, 3> with chord (5, 7)
- <4, 8, 10, 12, 4> with chord (8, 10)
- <5, 6, 1, 4, 5> with chord (1, 11)
- <8, 4, 1, 6, 8> with chord (1, 4)
- <10, 3, 5, 7, 10> with chord (5, 7)
- <12, 0, 1, 6, 12> with chord (1, 4)
- <13, 5, 7, 14, 13> with chord (5, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:

After checking for chords in the cycles, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found is [15].
