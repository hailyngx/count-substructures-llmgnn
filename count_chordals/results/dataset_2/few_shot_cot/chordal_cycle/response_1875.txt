Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 4, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 2, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
        - Cycle 1: (1, 5, 7, 3, 1)
        - Cycle 2: (1, 4, 8, 5, 1)
        - Cycle 3: (2, 6, 4, 3, 2)
        - Cycle 4: (3, 4, 8, 5, 3)
        - Cycle 5: (5, 6, 9, 8, 5)
        - Cycle 6: (6, 4, 1, 5, 6)
        - Cycle 7: (7, 5, 8, 4, 7)
        - Cycle 8: (9, 6, 2, 1, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Cycle 1 has chord (5, 3)
        - Cycle 2 has chord (4, 8)
        - Cycle 3 has chord (6, 4)
        - Cycle 4 has chord (4, 8)
        - Cycle 5 has chord (5, 9)
        - Cycle 6 has chord (1, 5)
        - Cycle 7 has chord (5, 8)
        - Cycle 8 has chord (1, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found: 
        - <1, 5, 7, 3>
        - <1, 4, 8, 5>
        - <2, 6, 4, 3>
        - <3, 4, 8, 5>
        - <5, 6, 9, 8>
        - <6, 4, 1, 5>
        - <7, 5, 8, 4>
        - <9, 6, 2, 1>
