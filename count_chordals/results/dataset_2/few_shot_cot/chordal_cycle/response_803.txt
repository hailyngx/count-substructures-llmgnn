Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: <11, 0, 26, 28, 11>
- Cycle 2: <11, 19, 12, 5, 11>
- Cycle 3: <16, 22, 23, 26, 18, 16>
- Cycle 4: <5, 12, 19, 17, 15, 10, 13, 7, 27, 6, 0, 11, 19, 12, 20, 29, 22, 4, 6, 27, 8, 19, 17, 15, 2, 3, 23, 26, 28, 25, 10, 13, 9, 8, 27, 7, 18, 26, 2, 4, 22, 16, 18, 7, 13, 10, 15, 2, 14, 8, 9, 13, 7, 27, 8, 19, 11, 0, 6, 4, 22, 29, 20, 12, 17, 19, 8, 27, 6, 21, 14, 25, 1, 18, 7, 13, 9, 27, 6, 4, 22, 23, 3, 28, 25, 14, 2>
- Cycle 5: <9, 8, 27, 7, 13, 10, 15, 2, 26, 28, 25, 14, 2, 15, 17, 12, 20, 29, 22, 4, 6, 21, 27, 18, 1, 25, 1, 18, 26, 23, 3, 24, 2, 14, 1, 25, 10, 15, 17, 19, 12, 5, 1, 18, 26, 0, 6, 27, 8, 9>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Checking Cycle 1 <11, 0, 26, 28, 11>: Chord present between 0 and 28.
- Checking Cycle 2 <11, 19, 12, 5, 11>: Chord present between 19 and 5.
- Checking Cycle 3 <16, 22, 23, 26, 18, 16>: Chord present between 22 and 26.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

- Number of chordless cycles: [0]

Final Result: [0]
