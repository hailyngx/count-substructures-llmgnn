Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 5) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (2, 4) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 2) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 5) (0, 8) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 3, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 3, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the given graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 4, 9, 0>
- Cycle 2: <2, 3, 5, 7, 2>
- Cycle 3: <3, 5, 7, 9, 3>
- Cycle 4: <4, 6, 8, 2, 4>
- Cycle 5: <5, 6, 7, 3, 5>
- Cycle 6: <6, 8, 3, 2, 6>
- Cycle 7: <7, 9, 4, 2, 7>
- Cycle 8: <8, 0, 1, 5, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycle in the graph is:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 1, 4, 9> with chord (0, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
