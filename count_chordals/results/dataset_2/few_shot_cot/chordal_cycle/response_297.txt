Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph, but we will focus on cycles of length 4 for this problem. 

Cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 7, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 15, 14, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 17, 4, 16, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 4, 16, 1>
- Cycle 5: <4, 7, 6, 12, 4>
- Cycle 6: <4, 9, 3, 13, 4>
- Cycle 7: <4, 17, 13, 3, 4>
- Cycle 8: <5, 0, 17, 4, 5>
- Cycle 9: <6, 7, 4, 16, 6>
- Cycle 10: <6, 10, 2, 11, 6>
- Cycle 11: <7, 1, 15, 14, 7>
- Cycle 12: <9, 3, 13, 17, 9>
- Cycle 13: <12, 6, 7, 18, 12>
- Cycle 14: <13, 3, 9, 4, 13>
- Cycle 15: <14, 15, 1, 18, 14>
- Cycle 16: <14, 16, 12, 6, 14>
- Cycle 17: <14, 19, 18, 7, 14>
- Cycle 18: <16, 12, 6, 10, 16>
- Cycle 19: <16, 18, 7, 4, 16>
- Cycle 20: <17, 13, 3, 9, 17>
- Cycle 21: <18, 7, 4, 17, 18>
- Cycle 22: <18, 19, 14, 15, 18>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the following cycles have exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 1, 7, 4, 0> with chord (1, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <4, 9, 3, 13, 4> with chord (9, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <6, 10, 2, 11, 6> with chord (10, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <14, 19, 18, 7, 14> with chord (19, 7)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles, we have found 18 chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final answer is [18].
