Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph, but not all of them have a chord. Let's list them all:
- Cycle <6, 9, 4, 0>
- Cycle <6, 9, 4, 10>
- Cycle <6, 9, 12, 10>
- Cycle <6, 0, 2, 8>
- Cycle <6, 0, 3, 11>
- Cycle <6, 5, 7, 1>
- Cycle <6, 5, 11, 3>
- Cycle <9, 4, 0, 2>
- Cycle <9, 4, 11, 3>
- Cycle <9, 8, 2, 13>
- Cycle <9, 12, 10, 13>
- Cycle <4, 0, 2, 8>
- Cycle <4, 0, 3, 11>
- Cycle <4, 10, 12, 9>
- Cycle <4, 10, 13, 2>
- Cycle <0, 2, 8, 15>
- Cycle <0, 3, 11, 5>
- Cycle <5, 6, 9, 4>
- Cycle <5, 6, 11, 3>
- Cycle <5, 7, 1, 15>
- Cycle <5, 11, 3, 0>
- Cycle <7, 1, 15, 8>
- Cycle <7, 14, 19, 16>
- Cycle <10, 12, 9, 6>
- Cycle <10, 12, 9, 4>
- Cycle <10, 13, 2, 8>
- Cycle <10, 13, 3, 11>
- Cycle <9, 12, 10, 4>
- Cycle <9, 12, 10, 13>
- Cycle <11, 5, 6, 9>
- Cycle <11, 5, 6, 0>
- Cycle <11, 3, 0, 2>
- Cycle <11, 3, 13, 10>
- Cycle <15, 1, 7, 5>
- Cycle <15, 1, 7, 14>
- Cycle <15, 8, 2, 0>
- Cycle <15, 8, 17, 9>
- Cycle <12, 10, 4, 9>
- Cycle <12, 10, 13, 3>
- Cycle <16, 18, 16, 19>
- Cycle <19, 14, 7, 1>
- Cycle <19, 14, 7, 5>
- Cycle <19, 14, 7, 15>

Step 2:
Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, 9, 4, 0> has chord (6, 4)
- <6, 9, 12, 10> has chord (9, 12)
- <6, 5, 7, 1> has chord (6, 1)
- <9, 8, 2, 13> has chord (8, 13)
- <7, 14, 19, 16> has chord (14, 19)
- <16, 18, 16, 19> has chord (16, 19)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [6].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<6, 9, 4, 0>
<6, 9, 12, 10>
<6, 5, 7, 1>
<9, 8, 2, 13>
<7, 14, 19, 16>
<16, 18, 16, 19>
