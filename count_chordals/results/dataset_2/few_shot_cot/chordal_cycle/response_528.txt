Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph. We will list them below: 
1. Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 6 - 8 - 0
2. Cycle 2: 0 - 4 - 7 - 14 - 0
3. Cycle 3: 0 - 5 - 3 - 1 - 0
4. Cycle 4: 0 - 5 - 12 - 6 - 0
5. Cycle 5: 0 - 5 - 12 - 9 - 0
6. Cycle 6: 2 - 5 - 12 - 6 - 2
7. Cycle 7: 2 - 8 - 6 - 12 - 2
8. Cycle 8: 2 - 10 - 3 - 1 - 2
9. Cycle 9: 2 - 10 - 7 - 4 - 2
10. Cycle 10: 3 - 1 - 12 - 9 - 3
11. Cycle 11: 3 - 1 - 12 - 6 - 3
12. Cycle 12: 3 - 5 - 4 - 7 - 3
13. Cycle 13: 3 - 5 - 4 - 0 - 3
14. Cycle 14: 3 - 5 - 12 - 6 - 3
15. Cycle 15: 3 - 10 - 7 - 4 - 3
16. Cycle 16: 4 - 6 - 12 - 9 - 4
17. Cycle 17: 4 - 6 - 12 - 1 - 4
18. Cycle 18: 4 - 7 - 11 - 9 - 4
19. Cycle 19: 4 - 7 - 11 - 3 - 4
20. Cycle 20: 5 - 3 - 10 - 7 - 5
21. Cycle 21: 5 - 12 - 6 - 8 - 5
22. Cycle 22: 5 - 12 - 6 - 9 - 5
23. Cycle 23: 5 - 12 - 9 - 11 - 5
24. Cycle 24: 7 - 4 - 0 - 14 - 7
25. Cycle 25: 10 - 3 - 1 - 12 - 10
26. Cycle 26: 10 - 3 - 5 - 4 - 10
27. Cycle 27: 10 - 7 - 11 - 9 - 10
28. Cycle 28: 10 - 7 - 14 - 0 - 10

Step 2: 
Among these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle where exactly one chord exists is:
1. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, (4, 14), 7, 10>

Step 3: 
After identifying the chordal 4-cycle, the final count of chordless cycles is calculated to be [28].
