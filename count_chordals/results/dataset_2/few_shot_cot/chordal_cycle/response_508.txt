Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more:
- <6, 9, 11, 1, (12, 4)> (Chord: 12-4)
- <6, 14, 5, 4, (12, 7)> (Chord: 12-7)
- <6, 5, 4, 12, (1, 7)> (Chord: 1-7)
- <6, 7, 8, 1, (3, 10)> (Chord: 3-10)
- <6, 2, 14, 9, (11, 5)> (Chord: 11-5)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <6, 9, 11, 1, (12, 4)> (Chord: 12-4) - Valid
- <6, 14, 5, 4, (12, 7)> (Chord: 12-7) - Valid
- <6, 5, 4, 12, (1, 7)> (Chord: 1-7) - Valid
- <6, 7, 8, 1, (3, 10)> (Chord: 3-10) - Valid
- <6, 2, 14, 9, (11, 5)> (Chord: 11-5) - Valid

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
