Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 0, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 5, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <0, 9, 7, 4, 1>
2. <0, 9, 7, 8, 1>
3. <0, 9, 7, 5, 8>
4. <0, 9, 6, 5, 7>
5. <0, 9, 6, 2, 1>
6. <0, 5, 7, 4, 1>
7. <0, 5, 7, 8, 1>
8. <0, 5, 7, 9, 6>
9. <0, 5, 8, 7, 4>
10. <0, 5, 8, 1, 2>
11. <0, 5, 8, 3, 7>
12. <0, 2, 6, 5, 8>
13. <0, 2, 6, 9, 7>
14. <0, 2, 1, 4, 7>
15. <0, 2, 1, 8, 5>
16. <0, 2, 1, 3, 7>
17. <1, 4, 7, 8, 5>
18. <1, 4, 7, 3, 8>
19. <1, 4, 7, 9, 6>
20. <1, 8, 7, 5, 0>
21. <1, 8, 7, 3, 0>
22. <1, 8, 5, 7, 4>
23. <1, 2, 6, 9, 7>
24. <2, 6, 9, 7, 5>
25. <2, 6, 5, 7, 4>
26. <3, 7, 9, 6, 5>
27. <3, 7, 9, 0, 2>
28. <3, 7, 5, 8, 1>
29. <5, 7, 9, 6, 0>
30. <5, 7, 9, 3, 8>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
Chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <0, (2, 6), 9, 7, 5>
2. <0, (1, 4), 7, 8, 5>
3. <0, (2, 6), 9, 7, 5>
4. <0, (1, 2), 6, 5, 9>
5. <0, (1, 8), 7, 5, 0>
6. <0, (5, 8), 7, 4, 1>
7. <0, (2, 9), 7, 5, 8>
8. <0, (1, 8), 5, 7, 4>
9. <0, (2, 6), 5, 7, 8>
10. <0, (2, 9), 5, 7, 8>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
