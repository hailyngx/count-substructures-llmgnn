Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (6, 5) (6, 8) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 0) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 2) (3, 8) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 2, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 1

Response:
Following the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
1. <0, 2, 4, 7, 0>
2. <0, 2, 9, 5, 1, 0>
3. <0, 3, 4, 7, 0>
4. <0, 3, 8, 1, 0>
5. <0, 7, 5, 1, 0>
6. <1, 2, 4, 7, 1>
7. <1, 5, 9, 2, 1>
8. <2, 4, 7, 0, 2>
9. <2, 4, 3, 8, 2>
10. <3, 4, 7, 0, 3>
11. <3, 8, 1, 0, 3>
12. <4, 7, 5, 1, 4>
13. <5, 1, 8, 3, 5>
14. <5, 7, 0, 3, 5>
15. <5, 9, 2, 4, 5>
16. <6, 5, 9, 1, 6>
17. <7, 0, 2, 9, 7>
18. <8, 3, 0, 7, 8>
19. <8, 3, 4, 7, 8>
20. <9, 5, 1, 8, 9>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycles found:
1. <0, (2, 9), 5, 1>
2. <1, (5, 9), 2, 8>
3. <2, (4, 7), 0, 2>
4. <3, (4, 8), 1, 0>
5. <4, (7, 5), 1, 4>
6. <5, (1, 8), 3, 5>
7. <6, 5, 9, 1, 6>
8. <7, (0, 2), 9, 7>
9. <8, (3, 7), 0, 8>
10. <9, (1, 5), 8, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which is 10.
Therefore, the final count is [10].
