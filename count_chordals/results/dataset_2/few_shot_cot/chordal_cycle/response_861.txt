Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for a chord:
1. <13, 22, 16, 11> - Chord: (22, 16)
2. <13, 22, 0, 17> - Chord: (22, 0)
3. <13, 22, 19, 14> - Chord: (22, 14)
4. <22, 16, 24, 19> - Chord: (16, 19)
5. <22, 0, 25, 24> - Chord: (0, 24)
6. <8, 13, 22, 16> - Chord: (13, 16)
7. <5, 8, 13, 22> - Chord: (8, 22)
8. <7, 1, 3, 27> - Chord: (1, 3)
9. <12, 7, 1, 3> - Chord: (1, 3)

Step 3:
Number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph: [9]
