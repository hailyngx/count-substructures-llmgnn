- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <2, (13, 21), 29>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (4, 29), 24>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <29, (21, 27), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <29, (21, 28), 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <18, (24, 27), 21>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <22, (3, 12), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <20, (14, 23), 25>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <20, (25, 26), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <17, (10, 15), 22>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <17, (0, 7), 19>

After checking all cycles, we found that there are [10] chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord.
