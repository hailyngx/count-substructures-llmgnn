Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4:
- Cycle 1: <3, 8, 13, 6, 3>
- Cycle 2: <9, 8, 13, 4, 9>
- Cycle 3: <4, 10, 1, 12, 4>
- Cycle 4: <5, 9, 2, 14, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 14, 3, 12, 5>
- Cycle 6: <11, 0, 1, 10, 11>

Step 2: Identify cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <3, 8, 13, 6, 3> with chord (8, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <9, 8, 13, 4, 9> with chord (8, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, 10, 1, 12, 4> with chord (10, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, 9, 2, 14, 5> with chord (9, 2)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 14, 3, 12, 5> with chord (14, 3)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <11, 0, 1, 10, 11> with chord (0, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are a total of [6] chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
