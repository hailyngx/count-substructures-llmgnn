Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 2: <1, 15, 12, 2, 8>  
- Cycle 3: <1, 15, 10, 17, 9>  
- Cycle 4: <1, 15, 10, 5, 6>  
- Cycle 5: <1, 16, 8, 2, 0>  
- Cycle 6: <1, 16, 17, 10, 5>  
- Cycle 7: <1, 16, 19, 9, 8>  
- Cycle 8: <1, 13, 19, 18, 0>

- Cycle 18: <5, 11, 13, 19, 18>  
- Cycle 19: <7, 3, 5, 11, 1>

- Cycle 32: <16, 17, 10, 5, 3>  
- Cycle 33: <16, 17, 9, 19, 13>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).  
- <1, 15, 10, 5, 3> has chord (5, 10)  
- <1, 15, 12, 2, 8> has chord (2, 12)  
- <1, 15, 10, 5, 6> has chord (5, 10)  
- <1, 16, 17, 10, 5> has chord (10, 17)  
- <1, 16, 19, 9, 8> has chord (9, 19)  
- <3, 5, 10, 17, 16> has chord (5, 10)  
- <3, 5, 6, 11, 13> has chord (5, 6)  
- <3, 6, 11, 13, 19> has chord (6, 11)  
- <5, 6, 11, 1, 16> has chord (6, 11)  
- <8, 2, 12, 15, 1> has chord (2, 12)  
- <8, 9, 19, 18, 0> has chord (9, 19)  
- <9, 17, 10, 15, 1> has chord (10, 15)  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
