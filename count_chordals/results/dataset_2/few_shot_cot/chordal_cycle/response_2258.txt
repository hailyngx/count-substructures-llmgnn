Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 8, 0, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 4, 1, 9>
- <0, 4, 1, 6>
- <0, 4, 2, 5>
- <0, 4, 2, 7>
- <0, 4, 5, 9>
- <0, 4, 5, 2>
- <0, 4, 7, 6>
- <1, 9, 5, 2>
- <1, 9, 6, 7>
- <1, 6, 7, 4>
- <2, 5, 9, 1>
- <2, 5, 8, 4>
- <2, 5, 8, 7>
- <2, 5, 4, 7>
- <2, 9, 6, 7>
- <2, 9, 5, 4>
- <4, 5, 8, 7>
- <4, 7, 6, 3>
- <5, 9, 6, 3>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, 4, 1, 9> (0, 1)
- <0, 4, 2, 5> (4, 5)
- <0, 4, 5, 9> (4, 9)
- <1, 9, 6, 7> (1, 6)
- <2, 5, 9, 1> (5, 9)
- <4, 5, 8, 7> (5, 8)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found gives us [18].
