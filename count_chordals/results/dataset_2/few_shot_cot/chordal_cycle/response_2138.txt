Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 11, 2, 6, 1> or <0, 11, 2, 6, 4>
- <0, 11, 2, 8, 13> or <0, 11, 2, 8, 4>
- <0, 11, 2, 12, 8> or <0, 11, 2, 12, 10>
- <0, 11, 2, 12, 9>
- <0, 11, 2, 12, 10, 7> or <0, 11, 2, 12, 8, 13>
- <0, 11, 2, 12, 10, 7, 13>
- <0, 11, 2, 12, 8, 13, 6> or <0, 11, 2, 12, 10, 7, 13, 6>
- <0, 11, 2, 12, 8, 13, 7>
- ... (and more cycles)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 11, 2, 6, 1> -> Chord: (6, 1)
- <0, 11, 2, 6, 4> -> Chord: (6, 4)
- <0, 11, 2, 8, 13> -> Chord: (8, 13)
- ... (and more cycles)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 11, 2, 6, 1> with chord (6, 1)
- <0, 11, 2, 6, 4> with chord (6, 4)
