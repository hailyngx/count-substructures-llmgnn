Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <4, 7, 3, 2, 4>
- Cycle 2: <4, 8, 2, 3, 4>
- Cycle 3: <4, 15, 1, 11, 4>
- Cycle 4: <4, 10, 16, 2, 4>
- Cycle 5: <7, 3, 9, 7>
- Cycle 6: <7, 3, 2, 18, 7>
- Cycle 7: <7, 9, 16, 2, 7>
- Cycle 8: <7, 4, 15, 13, 7>
- Cycle 9: <2, 18, 17, 11, 2>
- Cycle 10: <2, 3, 9, 8, 2>
- Cycle 11: <2, 8, 5, 12, 2>
- Cycle 12: <2, 16, 10, 4, 2>
- Cycle 13: <3, 9, 16, 10, 3>
- Cycle 14: <18, 17, 11, 19, 18>
- Cycle 15: <18, 13, 15, 4, 18>
- Cycle 16: <18, 5, 12, 4, 18>
- Cycle 17: <15, 13, 18, 5, 15>
- Cycle 18: <11, 17, 16, 10, 11>
- Cycle 19: <11, 5, 12, 4, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, (9, 16), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
