Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (4, 7, 11, 3) chord: (4, 11)
- (4, 7, 9, 14) chord: (7, 9)
- (7, 5, 2, 13) chord: (5, 13)
- (8, 12, 6, 14) chord: (8, 6)
- (0, 5, 2, 13) chord: (0, 13)
- (0, 1, 6, 14) chord: (0, 6)
  
Step 2: Check for a single chord in each cycle:
- <4, 7, 11, 3> (4, 11)
- <4, 7, 9, 14> (7, 9)
- <7, 5, 2, 13> (5, 13)
- <8, 12, 6, 14> (8, 6)
- <0, 5, 2, 13> (0, 13)
- <0, 1, 6, 14> (0, 6)
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [6].
