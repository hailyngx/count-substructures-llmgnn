Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:

- Cycle 1: 5-9-4-12-5
- Cycle 2: 1-5-12-15-1
- Cycle 3: 2-10-13-14-2
- Cycle 4: 4-9-10-13-4
- Cycle 5: 2-10-9-5-2
- Cycle 6: 18-6-5-12-18
- Cycle 7: 18-4-9-5-18
- Cycle 8: 18-15-12-5-18
- Cycle 9: 14-1-16-8-14
- Cycle 10: 13-10-9-5-13
- Cycle 11: 13-4-18-15-13
- Cycle 12: 13-3-2-10-13
- Cycle 13: 13-14-15-19-13
- Cycle 14: 15-18-6-5-15
- Cycle 15: 15-19-7-0-15
- Cycle 16: 15-12-0-9-15
- Cycle 17: 15-14-13-10-15

Step 2: Checking for one chord in each cycle:

- <1, (16, 5), 12>
- <2, (10, 13), 4>
- <3, (10, 13), 11>
- <4, (5, 9), 10>
- <5, (9, 2), 5>
- <6, (5, 18), 12>
- <7, (9, 18), 5>
- <8, (5, 18), 12>
- <9, (1, 16), 12>
- <10, (5, 9), 13>
- <11, (4, 18), 15>
- <12, (0, 12), 5>
- <13, (10, 13), 14>
- <14, (15, 13), 19>
- <15, (6, 18), 15>
- <16, (15, 0), 9>
- <17, (13, 14), 15>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [17]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [17].
