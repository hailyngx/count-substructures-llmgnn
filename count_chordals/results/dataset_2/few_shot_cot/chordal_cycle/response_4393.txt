Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord, the chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 11, 16, 15, 1> (Chord: (16, 11))
- <1, 7, 18, 16, 6, 1> (Chord: (18, 7))
- <1, 11, 19, 5, 4, 1> (Chord: (11, 19))
- <6, 1, 11, 16, 15, 6> (Chord: (1, 11))
- <3, 9, 2, 1, 11, 3> (Chord: (9, 2))
- <4, 7, 6, 11, 16, 4> (Chord: (6, 12))
- <4, 7, 18, 16, 11, 4> (Chord: (7, 18))
- <5, 0, 1, 11, 16, 5> (Chord: (0, 5))
- <12, 4, 7, 18, 16, 12> (Chord: (7, 6))
- <8, 15, 16, 11, 1, 8> (Chord: (15, 8))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [9].
