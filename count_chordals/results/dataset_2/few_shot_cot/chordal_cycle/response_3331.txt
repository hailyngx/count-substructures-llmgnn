Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 3) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 2) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 8
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (0, 5, 9, 8, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 6, 5, 9, 7, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 5, 9, 7, 2)
- Cycle 4: (3, 6, 5, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 5: (4, 5, 9, 7, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Cycle 1 has a chord: (9, 8)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (5, 9)
- Cycle 3 doesn't have a chord
- Cycle 4 doesn't have a chord
- Cycle 5 doesn't have a chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:

There are 3 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [3].

List of unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, (5, 9), 7>
- <2, 5, 9, 7>
- <3, 6, 5, 9>
