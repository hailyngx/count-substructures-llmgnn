Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 2) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 1) (0, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 8, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2:
Therefore, there are no chordal 4-cycles in this graph.

Step 3:
The final count of chordless 4-cycles is 0, so the answer is [0].
