Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 6, 9, 2)
- Cycle 2: (5, 1, 4, 8, 2)
- Cycle 3: (5, 4, 2, 8, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 4, 2, 8, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 4, 2, 7, 1)
- Cycle 6: (5, 4, 0, 6, 9)
- Cycle 7: (1, 6, 0, 4, 1)
- Cycle 8: (1, 4, 8, 5, 7)
- Cycle 9: (1, 7, 5, 4, 1)
- Cycle 10: (1, 7, 2, 9, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 1, 4, 2, 7)
- Cycle 12: (6, 9, 2, 4, 0)
- Cycle 13: (6, 9, 3, 0, 6)
- Cycle 14: (4, 0, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 15: (4, 0, 7, 5, 4)
- Cycle 16: (4, 2, 7, 5, 4)
- Cycle 17: (4, 2, 7, 1, 4)
- Cycle 18: (4, 2, 8, 5, 4)
- Cycle 19: (2, 8, 4, 0, 6)
- Cycle 20: (2, 8, 4, 1, 7)
- Cycle 21: (2, 8, 5, 7, 2)
- Cycle 22: (2, 9, 6, 1, 4)
- Cycle 23: (2, 9, 3, 0, 7)
- Cycle 24: (7, 5, 1, 6, 9)
- Cycle 25: (7, 5, 8, 2, 7)
- Cycle 26: (7, 9, 2, 4, 0)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:

- Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <1, (4, 8), 5>

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:

- There are [26] chordless cycles.
