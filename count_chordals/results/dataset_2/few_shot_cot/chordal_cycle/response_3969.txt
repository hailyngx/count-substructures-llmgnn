Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 in the graph:
        - Cycle 1: (11, 0, 8, 17, 11)
        - Cycle 2: (11, 5, 7, 13, 11)
        - Cycle 3: (11, 5, 1, 4, 16, 11)
        - Cycle 4: (11, 5, 1, 10, 6, 11)
        - Cycle 5: (11, 5, 10, 13, 11)
        - Cycle 6: (16, 4, 15, 14, 12, 16)
        - Cycle 7: (1, 4, 15, 14, 12, 1)
        - Cycle 8: (1, 4, 15, 14, 19, 1)
        - Cycle 9: (1, 4, 16, 11, 17, 1)
        - Cycle 10: (3, 6, 8, 0, 11, 3)
        - Cycle 11: (10, 1, 4, 16, 11, 10)
        - Cycle 12: (10, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10)
        - Cycle 13: (10, 5, 7, 18, 2, 10)
        - Cycle 14: (17, 11, 16, 4, 15, 17)
        - Cycle 15: (4, 15, 14, 12, 7, 4)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - The cycle <11, 0, 8, 17, 11> has chord (8, 17)
        - The cycle <11, 5, 7, 13, 11> has chord (7, 13)
        - The cycle <11, 5, 1, 4, 16, 11> has chord (1, 16)
        - The cycle <11, 5, 1, 10, 6, 11> has chord (1, 10)
        - The cycle <16, 4, 15, 14, 12, 16> has chord (15, 12)
        - The cycle <1, 4, 15, 14, 12, 1> has chord (15, 12)
        - The cycle <1, 4, 16, 11, 17, 1> has chord (4, 17)
        - The cycle <10, 1, 4, 16, 11, 10> has chord (4, 11)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found: 
        There are 11 chordless 4-cycles found in the graph.

Final answer: [11]
