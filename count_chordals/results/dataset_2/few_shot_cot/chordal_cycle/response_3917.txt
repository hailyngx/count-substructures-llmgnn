The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 5) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 7) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 2) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 5, 2, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 7, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 5, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 4

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 4>
- Cycle 3: <0, 2, 4, 8>
- Cycle 4: <0, 2, 7, 5>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 9, 4>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 8, 5>
- Cycle 7: <1, 5, 8, 4>
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 9, 8>
- Cycle 9: <2, 4, 1, 7>
- Cycle 10: <2, 7, 5, 8>
- Cycle 11: <3, 6, 9, 4>
- Cycle 12: <5, 6, 9, 8>
- Cycle 13: <5, 6, 7, 2>
- Cycle 14: <6, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 15: <6, 9, 4, 1>
  
Step 2:
Among the identified cycles above, the cycles containing exactly one chord are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 4>, chord: (5, 1)
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 4>, chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 3: <0, 2, 4, 8>, chord: (2, 8)
- Cycle 4: <0, 2, 7, 5>, chord: (2, 7)
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 9, 4>, chord: (6, 9)
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 8, 5>, chord: (4, 5)
- Cycle 7: <1, 5, 8, 4>, chord: (5, 8)
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 9, 8>, chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 9: <2, 4, 1, 7>, chord: (1, 7)
- Cycle 10: <2, 7, 5, 8>, chord: (7, 5)
  
Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 5 in total. Therefore, the final count is [5].
