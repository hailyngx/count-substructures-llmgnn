Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <9, 26, 23, 29> (Length 4)
- Cycle 2: <9, 26, 11, 19> (Length 4)
- Cycle 3: <9, 26, 4, 6> (Length 4)
- Cycle 4: <1, 21, 3, 10> (Length 4)
- Cycle 5: <1, 21, 22, 20> (Length 4)
- Cycle 6: <1, 21, 27, 29> (Length 4)
- Cycle 7: <1, 21, 3, 16> (Length 4)
- Cycle 8: <1, 8, 5, 15> (Length 4)
- Cycle 9: <1, 8, 20, 22> (Length 4)
- Cycle 10: <26, 23, 29, 27> (Length 4)
- Cycle 11: <26, 23, 28, 15> (Length 4)
- Cycle 12: <26, 11, 19, 29> (Length 4)
- Cycle 13: <26, 11, 22, 20> (Length 4)
- Cycle 14: <26, 11, 29, 27> (Length 4)
- Cycle 15: <26, 4, 6, 15> (Length 4)
- Cycle 16: <26, 4, 6, 2> (Length 4)
- Cycle 17: <21, 1, 8, 20> (Length 4)
- Cycle 18: <21, 1, 8, 5> (Length 4)
- Cycle 19: <21, 1, 3, 16> (Length 4)
- Cycle 20: <21, 3, 10, 27> (Length 4)
- Cycle 21: <21, 22, 20, 8> (Length 4)
- Cycle 22: <21, 22, 13, 9> (Length 4)
- Cycle 23: <21, 27, 29, 23> (Length 4)
- Cycle 24: <21, 27, 29, 11> (Length 4)
- Cycle 25: <14, 0, 17, 16> (Length 4)
- Cycle 26: <3, 21, 22, 20> (Length 4)
- Cycle 27: <3, 21, 27, 29> (Length 4)
- Cycle 28: <3, 21, 1, 8> (Length 4)
- Cycle 29: <3, 16, 24, 28> (Length 4)
- Cycle 30: <3, 10, 27, 23> (Length 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <9, 26, 23, 29> has a chord (26, 23), Chordal 4-cycle: <9, 26, 23, 29>
- <26, 23, 29, 27> has a chord (23, 29), Chordal 4-cycle: <26, 23, 29, 27>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [2].
