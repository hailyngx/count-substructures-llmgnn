Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 5) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 8) (1, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 3) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 0, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-7-2-6-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-7-5-4-9-3-0
- Cycle 3: 1-6-2-4-8-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-7-5-4-9-1
- Cycle 5: 2-6-9-4-5-2
- Cycle 6: 2-6-7-5-3-9-2
- Cycle 7: 3-9-4-8-3
- Cycle 8: 3-9-1-6-2-5-3
- Cycle 9: 4-9-6-7-5-4
- Cycle 10: 5-7-2-6-9-4-5

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, (7, 2), 6> (Cycle 1)
- <0, (7, 5), 4> (Cycle 2)
- <1, (6, 4), 8> (Cycle 3)
- <1, (6, 7), 5> (Cycle 4)
- <2, (6, 9), 4> (Cycle 5)
- <2, (6, 7), 5> (Cycle 6)
- <3, (9, 4), 8> (Cycle 7)
- <3, (9, 1), 6> (Cycle 8)
- <4, (9, 6), 7> (Cycle 9)
- <5, (7, 2), 6> (Cycle 10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
