Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: <3, 15, 25, 11>
- Cycle 2: <3, 15, 29, 6>
- Cycle 3: <7, 11, 25, 26>
- Cycle 4: <7, 11, 4, 15>
- Cycle 5: <7, 13, 11, 25>
- Cycle 6: <18, 7, 11, 4>
- Cycle 7: <18, 7, 6, 29>
- Cycle 8: <21, 18, 7, 11>
- Cycle 9: <21, 18, 5, 17>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.  
- Cycle 1: <3, 15, 25, 11> has chord (15, 11)  
- Cycle 2: <3, 15, 29, 6> has chord (15, 6)  
- Cycle 3: <7, 11, 25, 26> has chord (11, 25)  
- Cycle 4: <7, 11, 4, 15> has chord (11, 15)  
- Cycle 5: <7, 13, 11, 25> has chord (13, 11)  
- Cycle 6: <18, 7, 11, 4> has chord (7, 11)  
- Cycle 7: <18, 7, 6, 29> has chord (7, 6)  
- Cycle 8: <21, 18, 7, 11> has chord (18, 7)  
- Cycle 9: <21, 18, 5, 17> has chord (18, 5)  
  
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
There are 0 chordless cycles found.  
  
Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
