Response:
Step 1:  List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 15, 4>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 18, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 8, 6, 4>
- Cycle 4: <0, 8, 6, 12>
- Cycle 5: <0, 8, 1, 18>
- Cycle 6: <0, 11, 13, 14>
- Cycle 7: <2, 3, 17, 10>
- Cycle 8: <2, 3, 17, 10, 12>
- Cycle 9: <2, 15, 5, 0>
- Cycle 10: <2, 15, 4, 9>
- Cycle 11: <2, 15, 5, 18>
- Cycle 12: <2, 16, 12, 6>
- Cycle 13: <2, 16, 9, 4>
- Cycle 14: <2, 17, 10, 12>
- Cycle 15: <3, 17, 10, 12>
- Cycle 16: <4, 6, 12, 16>
- Cycle 17: <4, 6, 19, 10>
- Cycle 18: <5, 0, 11, 13>
- Cycle 19: <5, 15, 2, 3>
- Cycle 20: <6, 3, 17, 10>
- Cycle 21: <6, 3, 17, 2>
- Cycle 22: <6, 3, 17, 10, 12>
- Cycle 23: <6, 4, 15, 2>
- Cycle 24: <8, 0, 11, 13>
- Cycle 25: <8, 0, 5, 15>
- Cycle 26: <8, 0, 5, 18>
- Cycle 27: <8, 1, 18, 9>
- Cycle 28: <13, 11, 0, 5>
- Cycle 29: <13, 11, 0, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, 5, 15, 4, (9, 16)>
- <0, 5, 18, 1, (9, 14)>
- <0, 8, 6, 4, (15, 2)>
- <0, 8, 1, 18, (5, 15)>
- <2, 3, 17, 10, (12, 16)>
- <2, 15, 5, 0, (4, 6)>
- <4, 6, 12, 16, (2, 15)>
- <5, 15, 2, 3, (0, 8)>
- <6, 3, 17, 10, (12, 16)>
- <6, 4, 15, 2, (8, 0)>
- <8, 0, 11, 13, (5, 18)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles is [11].
