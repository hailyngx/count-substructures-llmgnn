Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 0) (4, 2) (4, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, 4, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- <0, 6, 8, 1> 
- <0, 3, 7, 9> 
- <0, 4, 2, 5> 

Step 2: 
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- The cycle <0, 6, 8, 1> has no chords.
- The cycle <0, 3, 7, 9> has no chords.
- The cycle <0, 4, 2, 5> has a chord between nodes 4 and 5, creating the chordal 4-cycle <0, 4, 5, 2>.

Step 3: 
There is 1 chordal 4-cycle found.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
