Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 5, 6>
- Cycle 2: <0, 7, 2, 11>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 8, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 4, 10, 0>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 5, 13>
- Cycle 6: <2, 7, 13, 9>
- Cycle 7: <2, 11, 8, 3>
- Cycle 8: <3, 6, 12, 9>
- Cycle 9: <4, 5, 13, 9>
- Cycle 10: <4, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle 11: <4, 10, 12, 6>
- Cycle 12: <5, 6, 12, 13>
- Cycle 13: <7, 0, 10, 12>
- Cycle 14: <7, 2, 11, 8>
- Cycle 15: <8, 3, 9, 13>
- Cycle 16: <9, 12, 10, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 14: <7, 2, 11, 8> has exactly one chord (7, 11).
- Only Cycle 3: <1, 3, 8, 0> has exactly one chord (1, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]
