Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 9) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 7) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 0) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 2) (0, 8) (0, 9) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 8) (9, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 2, 8, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, 9, and node 6
Node 5 is not connected to any other nodes.
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 9, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <4, 7, 1, 9, 4>
- Cycle 2: <6, 4, 9, 3, 6>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 4, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 3, 8, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 <4, 7, 1, 9, 4> has chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 2 <6, 4, 9, 3, 6> has chord (4, 3)
- Cycle 3 <0, 7, 4, 2, 0> has chord (7, 2)
- Cycle 4 <0, 9, 3, 8, 0> has chord (9, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.

Thus, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
