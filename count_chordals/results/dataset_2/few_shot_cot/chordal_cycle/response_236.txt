Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <0, 10, 15, 12>
        - <0, 10, 14, 9>
        - <0, 9, 16, 4>
        - <0, 15, 12, 1>
        - <1, 12, 15, 10>
        - <1, 12, 14, 9>
        - <1, 4, 16, 9>
        - <1, 6, 17, 7>
        - <1, 6, 8, 3>
        - <2, 3, 8, 1>
        - <3, 8, 6, 17>
        - <3, 8, 1, 12>
        - <4, 9, 14, 13>
        - <4, 9, 19, 17>
        - <4, 16, 15, 12>
        - <5, 7, 6, 17>
        - <5, 7, 17, 19>
        - <6, 1, 12, 15>
        - <6, 1, 8, 3>
        - <6, 7, 17, 19>
        - <8, 3, 5, 7>
        - <9, 14, 13, 11>
        - <9, 19, 17, 6>
        - <10, 14, 13, 11>
        - <10, 14, 12, 15>
        - <11, 13, 14, 9>
        - <12, 14, 13, 11>
        - <15, 12, 14, 13>
        - <16, 4, 1, 6>
        - <16, 4, 9, 14>
        - <16, 9, 14, 13>
        - <16, 9, 19, 17>
        - <16, 15, 12, 14>
        - <17, 6, 8, 3>
        - <17, 7, 6, 1>
        - <17, 7, 5, 3>
        - <19, 17, 6, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - <0, 10, 15, 12> has chord (10, 15)
        - <0, 10, 14, 9> has chord (10, 14)
        - <1, 4, 16, 9> has chord (4, 16)
        - <1, 6, 17, 7> has chord (6, 17)
        - <1, 6, 8, 3> has chord (6, 8)
        - <4, 9, 19, 17> has chord (9, 17)
        - <6, 1, 8, 3> has chord (1, 8)
        - <16, 9, 14, 13> has chord (9, 14)
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles are:
        - <0, 10, 15, 12>
        - <0, 10, 14, 9>
        - <1, 4, 16, 9>
        - <1, 6, 17, 7>
        - <1, 6, 8, 3>
        - <4, 9, 19, 17>
        - <6, 1, 8, 3>
        - <16, 9, 14, 13>
