Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- <0, 4, 9, 5>
- <0, 9, 5, 14>
- <0, 9, 4, 8>
- <0, 10, 1, 6>
- <0, 10, 6, 3>
- <1, 6, 3, 5>
- <1, 6, 8, 7>
- <1, 12, 5, 14>
- <1, 14, 5, 9>
- <1, 14, 2, 11>
- <2, 11, 3, 6>
- <2, 11, 7, 13>
- <2, 12, 5, 14>
- <2, 12, 13, 7>
- <3, 6, 8, 7>
- <3, 6, 1, 14>
- <3, 11, 2, 1>
- <4, 9, 5, 14>
- <4, 9, 7, 13>
- <5, 14, 1, 6>
- <5, 14, 9, 7>
- <6, 10, 0, 9>
- <6, 10, 13, 7>
- <7, 13, 12, 2>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 4, 9, 5> (Chord: 9-5)
- <0, 9, 5, 14> (Chord: 5-14)
- <1, 6, 3, 5> (Chord: 6-3)
- <1, 6, 8, 7> (Chord: 6-8)
- <2, 12, 13, 7> (Chord: 12-7)
- <3, 6, 8, 7> (Chord: 6-8)
- <3, 6, 1, 14> (Chord: 6-1)
- <3, 11, 2, 1> (Chord: 11-1)
- <4, 9, 7, 13> (Chord: 9-13)
- <6, 10, 0, 9> (Chord: 10-9)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [5]

Unique chordal 4-cycle: 
- <0, 4, 9, 5>
- <0, 9, 5, 14>
- <1, 6, 3, 5>
- <1, 6, 8, 7>
- <2, 12, 13, 7>
