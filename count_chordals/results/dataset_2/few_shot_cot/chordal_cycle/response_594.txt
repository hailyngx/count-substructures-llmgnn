Response:
Step 1: 
Possible cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 13, 2, 1, 11, 10>
2. <0, 13, 2, 12, 4, 5>
3. <1, 11, 8, 5, 14, 4>
4. <1, 11, 13, 9, 7, 10>
5. <1, 12, 2, 6, 10, 7>
6. <1, 12, 8, 13, 9, 7>
7. <1, 14, 3, 5, 8, 12>
8. <1, 14, 7, 5, 4, 12>
9. <2, 13, 9, 7, 10, 6>
10. <3, 14, 4, 5, 8, 12>
11. <3, 14, 5, 7, 10, 6>
12. <3, 5, 8, 12, 4, 14>
13. <4, 12, 8, 11, 10, 6>
14. <4, 12, 8, 13, 11, 1>
15. <4, 12, 14, 7, 10, 6>
16. <4, 14, 3, 5, 8, 12>
17. <5, 8, 12, 14, 7, 10>
18. <5, 8, 13, 11, 10, 6>
19. <5, 14, 4, 12, 8, 13>
20. <5, 14, 7, 10, 6, 2>
21. <7, 10, 6, 2, 13, 11>
22. <7, 10, 6, 2, 12, 8>
23. <7, 10, 6, 2, 1, 12>
24. <7, 14, 3, 5, 8, 12>
25. <8, 11, 1, 12, 4, 14>
26. <10, 11, 1, 12, 4, 14>
27. <10, 11, 1, 14, 3, 5>
28. <10, 11, 8, 13, 9, 7>
29. <10, 6, 2, 1, 11, 13>
30. <10, 7, 9, 13, 11, 1>
31. <11, 1, 14, 7, 10, 6>
32. <11, 8, 13, 9, 7, 14>
33. <12, 1, 11, 10, 6, 2>
34. <12, 1, 11, 13, 9, 7>
35. <12, 8, 5, 4, 14, 7>
36. <12, 8, 11, 10, 6, 2>
37. <12, 8, 11, 13, 9, 7>
38. <12, 14, 4, 12, 8, 11>
39. <13, 0, 1, 11, 10, 6>
40. <13, 0, 1, 12, 4, 14>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <0, 13, 2, 1, 11> with chord (13, 11)
- <1, 14, 7, 5, 8> with chord (14, 7)
- <3, 5, 8, 12, 4> with chord (5, 12)
- <4, 12, 14, 7, 10> with chord (12, 7)

So, the number of chordless cycles found is [36].
