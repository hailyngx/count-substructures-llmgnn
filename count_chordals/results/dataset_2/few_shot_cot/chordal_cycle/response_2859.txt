Node 5 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 9, 0, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 8, 4, 1> with the edges (0, 8), (8, 4), (4, 1), (1, 0)
2. Cycle <0, 8, 9, 1> with the edges (0, 8), (8, 9), (9, 1), (1, 0)
3. Cycle <1, 4, 5, 2> with the edges (1, 4), (4, 5), (5, 2), (2, 1)
4. Cycle <1, 4, 6, 0> with the edges (1, 4), (4, 6), (6, 0), (0, 1)
5. Cycle <1, 5, 2, 9> with the edges (1, 5), (5, 2), (2, 9), (9, 1)
6. Cycle <1, 5, 7, 2> with the edges (1, 5), (5, 7), (7, 2), (2, 1)
7. Cycle <2, 5, 7, 9> with the edges (2, 5), (5, 7), (7, 9), (9, 2)
8. Cycle <3, 5, 7, 9> with the edges (3, 5), (5, 7), (7, 9), (9, 3)
9. Cycle <4, 5, 7, 8> with the edges (4, 5), (5, 7), (7, 8), (8, 4)
10. Cycle <4, 6, 7, 8> with the edges (4, 6), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 4)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for a chord:
- Cycle <0, 8, 4, 1> has a chord (4, 1)
- Cycle <0, 8, 9, 1> has a chord (8, 9)
- Cycle <1, 4, 5, 2> has a chord (4, 2)
- Cycle <1, 4, 6, 0> has a chord (4, 6)
- Cycle <1, 5, 2, 9> has a chord (5, 9)
- Cycle <1, 5, 7, 2> has a chord (5, 7)
- Cycle <2, 5, 7, 9> has a chord (5, 9)
- Cycle <3, 5, 7, 9> has no chord
- Cycle <4, 5, 7, 8> has a chord (5, 8)
- Cycle <4, 6, 7, 8> has a chord (6, 8)

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [8].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, 8, 4, 1> with chord (4, 1)
2. <0, 8, 9, 1> with chord (8, 9)
3. <1, 4, 5, 2> with chord (4, 2)
4. <1, 4, 6, 0> with chord (4, 6)
5. <1, 5, 2, 9> with chord (5, 9)
6. <1, 5, 7, 2> with chord (5, 7)
7. <2, 5, 7, 9> with chord (5, 9)
8. <4, 6, 7, 8> with chord (6, 8)
