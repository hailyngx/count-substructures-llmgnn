Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 7) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 3) (6, 2) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 1) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 7) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 6, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 5, 2>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 4, 6>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 7, 5>
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, 5, 9>
- Cycle 5: <1, 2, 4, 8>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 7, 3>
- Cycle 7: <2, 4, 6, 8>
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 7, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 4, 6, 8>
- Cycle 10: <3, 5, 7, 0>
- Cycle 11: <3, 7, 8, 4>
- Cycle 12: <5, 7, 8, 4>
- Cycle 13: <5, 9, 1, 2>
- Cycle 14: <6, 3, 4, 8>
  
Step 2: Checking for one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 3, 5, 2> has one chord: (3, 5)
- <1, 2, 5, 9> has one chord: (2, 9)
- <1, 2, 4, 8> has one chord: (2, 8)
- <1, 5, 7, 3> has one chord: (5, 3)
- <2, 4, 6, 8> has one chord: (4, 8)
  
Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
- The number of chordless cycles found is [10].
