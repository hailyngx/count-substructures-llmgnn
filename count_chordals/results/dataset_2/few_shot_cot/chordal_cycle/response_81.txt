Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 12) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 13) (4, 1) (7, 11) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 14) (6, 11) (6, 8) (6, 13) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 14) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 8) (0, 14) (0, 11) (0, 1) (14, 5) (14, 6) (14, 8) (14, 0) (14, 11) (2, 7) (2, 12) (12, 5) (12, 2) (12, 13) (12, 3) (11, 7) (11, 6) (11, 0) (11, 14) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 12) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (13, 4) (13, 6) (13, 12) (13, 10) (10, 5) (10, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 1, 4, 8, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 14, 11, 7, 3, 12, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 9, 6, 7, 11, 0, 14, 5)
- Cycle 4: (3, 7, 11, 0, 1, 5, 3)
- Cycle 5: (4, 1, 5, 9, 6, 13, 4)
- Cycle 6: (12, 5, 9, 6, 13, 12)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <2, (12, 3), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

The number of chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord is [1].
