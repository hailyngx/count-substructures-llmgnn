Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 9, 4, 8>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 7, 6, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 7, 6, 9>
- Cycle 5: <0, 5, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 9, 5, 7>
- Cycle 8: <2, 5, 7, 6, 1>
- Cycle 9: <2, 5, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle 10: <2, 5, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 11: <2, 5, 7, 6, 9>
- Cycle 12: <3, 5, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle 13: <3, 5, 7, 6, 1>
- Cycle 14: <3, 5, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 15: <3, 5, 7, 6, 9>
- Cycle 16: <4, 9, 5, 7, 6>
- Cycle 17: <4, 9, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 18: <4, 9, 8, 3, 5>
- Cycle 19: <4, 9, 5, 3, 0>
- Cycle 20: <7, 5, 9, 4, 3>
- Cycle 21: <7, 5, 3, 0, 2>
- Cycle 22: <8, 9, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 23: <8, 9, 4, 3, 5>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 5, 9, 4, 8>: (0, 9) is a chord
- <0, 5, 7, 6, 1>: (0, 6) is a chord
- <0, 5, 9, 6, 1>: (5, 1) is a chord
- <0, 5, 7, 6, 9>: (5, 9) is a chord
- <0, 5, 9, 8, 4>: (5, 8) is a chord
- <1, 6, 9, 8, 4>: (6, 8) is a chord
- <1, 6, 9, 5, 7>: (6, 5) is a chord
- <2, 5, 7, 6, 1>: (5, 6) is a chord
- <2, 5, 9, 6, 1>: (5, 6) is a chord
- <2, 5, 9, 8, 4>: (5, 8) is a chord
- <2, 5, 7, 6, 9>: (5, 9) is a chord
- <3, 5, 9, 6, 1>: (5, 6) is a chord
- <3, 5, 7, 6, 1>: (5, 6) is a chord
- <3, 5, 9, 8, 4>: (5, 8) is a chord
- <3, 5, 7, 6, 9>: (5, 9) is a chord
- <4, 9, 5, 7, 6>: (9, 7) is a chord
- <4, 9, 6, 1, 7>: (9, 1) is a chord
- <4, 9, 8, 3, 5>: (9, 3) is a chord
- <4, 9, 5, 3, 0>: (9, 3) is a chord
- <7, 5, 9, 4, 3>: (5, 3) is a chord
- <7, 5, 3, 0, 2>: (5, 0) is a chord
- <8, 9, 6, 1, 7>: (9, 1) is a chord
- <8, 9, 4, 3, 5>: (9, 3) is a chord

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Final answer: [0]
