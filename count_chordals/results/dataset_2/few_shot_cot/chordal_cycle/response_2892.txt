Node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 6, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 4, 5, 1, 0>
- <0, 4, 8, 1, 0>
- <0, 4, 9, 5, 0>
- <1, 5, 4, 8, 1>
- <1, 5, 9, 4, 1>
- <3, 5, 4, 8, 3>
- <3, 5, 9, 4, 3>
- <3, 5, 1, 4, 3>
- <3, 6, 5, 4, 3>
- <4, 9, 5, 3, 4>
- <4, 9, 5, 1, 4>
- <4, 9, 3, 5, 4>
- <5, 9, 4, 3, 5>
- <5, 9, 4, 1, 5>
- <5, 1, 3, 4, 5>
- <6, 5, 9, 4, 6>
- <6, 3, 5, 4, 6>
- <7, 6, 5, 4, 7>
- <8, 4, 9, 5, 8>

Step 2: Checking for chorded cycles:
- <0, 4, 5, 1, 0> has a chord (1, 5) as the chord.
- <0, 4, 8, 1, 0> has a chord (1, 8) as the chord.
- <0, 4, 9, 5, 0> has a chord (5, 9) as the chord.
- <1, 5, 4, 8, 1> has a chord (4, 8) as the chord.
- <1, 5, 9, 4, 1> has a chord (5, 9) as the chord.
- <3, 5, 9, 4, 3> has a chord (5, 9) as the chord.
- <4, 9, 5, 3, 4> has a chord (3, 5) as the chord.
- <4, 9, 5, 1, 4> has a chord (1, 5) as the chord.
- <5, 9, 4, 3, 5> has a chord (3, 4) as the chord.
- <5, 1, 3, 4, 5> has a chord (1, 3) as the chord.
- <6, 5, 9, 4, 6> has a chord (5, 9) as the chord.
- <6, 3, 5, 4, 6> has a chord (3, 5) as the chord.
- <7, 6, 5, 4, 7> has a chord (5, 4) as the chord.
- <8, 4, 9, 5, 8> has a chord (4, 5) as the chord.

Step 3: Counting chordal 4-cycles:
There are 14 chordal 4-cycles found.
Therefore, the final count is [14].
