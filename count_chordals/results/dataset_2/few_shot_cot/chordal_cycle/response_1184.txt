Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 4) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 4) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 7) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle <0, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle <0, 9, 5, 7>
- Cycle <1, 9, 6, 8>
- Cycle <2, 9, 1, 3>
- Cycle <3, 5, 7, 9>
- Cycle <4, 6, 8, 1>
- Cycle <5, 7, 2, 9>
- Cycle <6, 8, 4, 0>
- Cycle <7, 5, 9, 6>
- Cycle <8, 6, 4, 0>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 9, 6, 4> with chord (6, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 9, 5, 7> with chord (7, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle <1, 9, 6, 8> with chord (6, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle <2, 9, 1, 3> with chord (1, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 5, 7, 9> with chord (7, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle <4, 6, 8, 1> with chord (8, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 7, 2, 9> with chord (2, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle <6, 8, 4, 0> with chord (4, 8)
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, 5, 9, 6> with chord (5, 9)
- Chordal 4-cycle <8, 6, 4, 0> with chord (0, 6)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [0].
