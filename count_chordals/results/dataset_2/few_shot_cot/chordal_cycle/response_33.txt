Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- (0, 4, 11, 7)
- (0, 4, 3, 7)
- (0, 5, 10, 3)
- (0, 5, 2, 8)
- (0, 9, 1, 11)
- (1, 12, 6, 2)
- (1, 14, 10, 5)
- (2, 6, 12, 7)
- (2, 8, 3, 10)
- (3, 7, 12, 4)
- (3, 9, 1, 11)
- (4, 11, 10, 13)
- (5, 10, 13, 4)
- (8, 3, 7, 12)
- (8, 14, 1, 9)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordless cycles: (0, 4, 11, 7), (0, 4, 3, 7), (0, 5, 10, 3), (0, 5, 2, 8), (1, 14, 10, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 5.
Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 4, 11, 7>
- <0, 4, 3, 7>
- <0, 5, 10, 3>
- <0, 5, 2, 8>
- <1, 14, 10, 5>
