Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (4, 5) (4, 10) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 12) (8, 13) (8, 14) (8, 10) (8, 1) (13, 5) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 14) (13, 0) (0, 13) (0, 14) (0, 3) (0, 11) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 13) (14, 0) (14, 12) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 11) (11, 0) (11, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 10) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 13) (2, 3) (10, 4) (10, 8) (10, 3) (12, 5) (12, 6) (12, 14)

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in this graph are:

<0, 11, 1, 6> with chord (0, 1)
<0, 11, 1, 8> with chord (1, 8)
<2, 7, 9, 3> with chord (7, 3)
<2, 13, 5, 9> with chord (5, 9)
<6, 12, 5, 14> with chord (5, 14)

There are a total of [5] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
