Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are 7 cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
1. <0, 6, 5, 1, 8>
2. <0, 8, 2, 4, 7>
3. <0, 8, 7, 4, 6>
4. <1, 6, 5, 1, 9>
5. <1, 9, 6, 0, 8>
6. <2, 4, 6, 5, 1>
7. <3, 6, 4, 2, 8>

Step 2:
- Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. <0, 6, 5, 1, 8> - No chord
2. <0, 8, 2, 4, 7> - Chord: (2, 4)
3. <0, 8, 7, 4, 6> - Chord: (7, 0)
4. <1, 6, 5, 1, 9> - No chord
5. <1, 9, 6, 0, 8> - No chord
6. <2, 4, 6, 5, 1> - No chord
7. <3, 6, 4, 2, 8> - No chord

Step 3:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found with one chord. Therefore, the final count is [2]. 
The unique chordal 4-cycles are <0, 8, 2, 4, 7> and <0, 8, 7, 4, 6>.
