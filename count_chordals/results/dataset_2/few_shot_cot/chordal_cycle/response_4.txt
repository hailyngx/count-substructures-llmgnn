Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (8, 6) (8, 4) (8, 5) (8, 0) (8, 1) (5, 8) (5, 3) (5, 7) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (1, 8) (1, 7) (1, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 8, 7, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 0, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
There are no cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph.

Step 2:
There are no cycles to check for chords.
