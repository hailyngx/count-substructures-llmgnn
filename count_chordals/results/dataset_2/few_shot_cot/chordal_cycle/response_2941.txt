Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 9, and node 10
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 7, 13, and node 12
Node 10 is connected to node 11, 3, 8, 1, 4, and node 14
Node 11 is connected to node 10, and node 4
Node 12 is connected to node 9, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 13 is connected to node 9, 14, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <0, 1, 12, 3>
- <0, 1, 4, 10>
- <0, 6, 7, 5>
- <1, 2, 3, 10>
- <1, 4, 11, 10>
- <2, 3, 13, 9>
- <2, 5, 14, 10>
- <4, 10, 14, 13>
- <6, 7, 9, 12>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, only <0, 1, 12, 3> has exactly one chord, which is edge (1, 12). 

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is thus [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle:
<0, 1, 12, 3>
