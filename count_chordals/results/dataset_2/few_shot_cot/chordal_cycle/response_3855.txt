Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <0, 2, 1, 5, 14, 13>
- <0, 19, 4, 13, 14, 12>
- <1, 11, 10, 7, 12, 6>
- <6, 12, 7, 10, 17, 11>
- <7, 3, 9, 18, 5, 14>
- <3, 12, 7, 10, 11, 15>
- <5, 18, 9, 7, 10, 11>
- <4, 13, 8, 19, 5, 14>

Step 2: Checking for chords in each cycle:
- Cycle <0, 2, 1, 5, 14, 13> has a chord (1, 5)
- Cycle <0, 19, 4, 13, 14, 12> has a chord (4, 14)
- Cycle <1, 11, 10, 7, 12, 6> has a chord (10, 7)
- Cycle <6, 12, 7, 10, 17, 11> has a chord (12, 10)
- Cycle <7, 3, 9, 18, 5, 14> has a chord (9, 5)
- Cycle <3, 12, 7, 10, 11, 15> has no chords
- Cycle <5, 18, 9, 7, 10, 11> has no chords
- Cycle <4, 13, 8, 19, 5, 14> has a chord (8, 19)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 2 chordless cycles: <3, 12, 7, 10, 11, 15> and <5, 18, 9, 7, 10, 11>

Putting this final number inside brackets gives [2].
