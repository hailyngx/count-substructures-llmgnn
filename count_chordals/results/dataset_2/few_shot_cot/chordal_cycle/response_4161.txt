Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 7, 4, 5, 3, 0>
- <0, 7, 4, 1, 9, 0>
- <0, 7, 11, 5, 4, 13, 0>
- <0, 13, 4, 1, 9, 3, 0>
- <1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 12, 10, 8, 1>
- <1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 12, 9, 6, 5, 3, 0, 13, 2, 8, 10, 1>
- <2, 9, 1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 12, 10, 8, 3, 5, 6, 2>
- <3, 9, 6, 5, 4, 7, 11, 14, 12, 10, 8, 1>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for a chord:
- <0, 7, 4, 5, 3, 0> has a chord: (4, 3)
- <0, 7, 4, 1, 9, 0> has a chord: (7, 1)
- <0, 7, 11, 5, 4, 13, 0> has a chord: (11, 5)
- <0, 13, 4, 1, 9, 3, 0> has a chord: (4, 9)
- <1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 12, 10, 8, 1> is chordless
- <1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 12, 9, 6, 5, 3, 0, 13, 2, 8, 10, 1> is chordless
- <2, 9, 1, 4, 7, 11, 14, 12, 10, 8, 3, 5, 6, 2> is chordless
- <3, 9, 6, 5, 4, 7, 11, 14, 12, 10, 8, 1> is chordless

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles: [4]

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [4].
