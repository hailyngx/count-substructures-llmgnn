Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <0, 1, 5, 11, 10>
2. <0, 1, 5, 11, 9>
3. <0, 1, 7, 4, 10>
4. <0, 1, 7, 4, 6>
5. <0, 5, 11, 9, 12>
6. <0, 5, 11, 10, 4>
7. <0, 5, 11, 10, 8>
8. <0, 5, 11, 10, 1>
9. <0, 5, 3, 2, 7>
10. <0, 5, 3, 2, 6>
11. <0, 5, 3, 4, 7>
12. <1, 7, 4, 10, 11>
13. <1, 7, 4, 6, 2>
14. <1, 7, 9, 11, 10>
15. <1, 10, 4, 6, 2>
16. <1, 10, 8, 4, 7>
17. <4, 7, 2, 3, 5>
18. <4, 7, 2, 6, 6>
19. <4, 7, 6, 2, 3>
20. <4, 7, 9, 11, 10>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
1. <0, 1, 5, 11, 10> - Chord: (1, 5)
2. <0, 1, 5, 11, 9> - Chord: (1, 5)
3. <0, 1, 7, 4, 10> - Chord: (1, 4)
4. <0, 1, 7, 4, 6> - Chord: (1, 4)
5. <0, 5, 11, 9, 12> - Chord: (5, 9)
6. <0, 5, 11, 10, 4> - Chord: (5, 10)
7. <0, 5, 11, 10, 8> - Chord: (5, 10)
8. <0, 5, 11, 10, 1> - Chord: (5, 10)
9. <0, 5, 3, 2, 7> - Chord: (3, 7)
10. <0, 5, 3, 2, 6> - Chord: (3, 6)
11. <0, 5, 3, 4, 7> - Chord: (3, 7)
12. <1, 7, 4, 10, 11> - Chord: (4, 11)
13. <1, 7, 4, 6, 2> - Chord: (4, 2)
14. <1, 7, 9, 11, 10> - Chord: (9, 11)
15. <1, 10, 4, 6, 2> - Chord: (4, 6)
16. <1, 10, 8, 4, 7> - Chord: (8, 4)
17. <4, 7, 2, 3, 5> - Chord: (2, 5)
18. <4, 7, 2, 6, 6> - Chord: (2, 6)
19. <4, 7, 6, 2, 3> - Chord: (6, 3)
20. <4, 7, 9, 11, 10> - Chord: (9, 10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [20] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
