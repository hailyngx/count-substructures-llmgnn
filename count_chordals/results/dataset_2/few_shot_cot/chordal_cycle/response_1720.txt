Response:
Step 1: 
Possible cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- <16, 11, 1, 6> (4-cycle)
- <16, 11, 9, 7> (4-cycle)
- <16, 11, 9, 12> (4-cycle)
- <16, 5, 4, 6> (4-cycle)
- <16, 5, 4, 7> (4-cycle)
- <16, 13, 14, 18> (4-cycle)
- <13, 3, 18, 14> (4-cycle)
- <13, 4, 12, 19> (4-cycle)
- <13, 4, 7, 9> (4-cycle)
- <4, 12, 19, 0> (4-cycle)
- <18, 3, 13, 4> (4-cycle)
- <18, 14, 10, 2> (4-cycle)
- <18, 14, 13, 4> (4-cycle)
- <18, 8, 19, 7> (4-cycle)
- <19, 0, 15, 1> (4-cycle)

Step 2:
Checking for chords:
- Chord in <16, 11, 1, 6> is (1, 6)
- Chord in <16, 11, 9, 7> is (9, 7)
- Chord in <16, 11, 9, 12> is (9, 12)
- Chord in <16, 5, 4, 6> is (5, 4)
- Chord in <16, 5, 4, 7> is (5, 4)
- Chord in <16, 13, 14, 18> is (14, 18)
- Chord in <13, 3, 18, 14> is (3, 14)
- Chord in <13, 4, 12, 19> is (4, 19)
- Chord in <18, 3, 13, 4> is (13, 4)
- Chord in <18, 14, 10, 2> is (14, 2)
- Chord in <18, 14, 13, 4> is (14, 4)
- Chord in <19, 0, 15, 1> is (0, 15)

Step 3:
Number of chordless cycles found: [0]
