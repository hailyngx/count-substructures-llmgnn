Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 in the graph are: 
  - <0, 11, 7, 14, 10>
  - <0, 11, 7, 6, 3>
  - <0, 11, 13, 2, 12>
  - <0, 11, 13, 8, 3>
  - <0, 11, 13, 10, 4>
  - <0, 8, 13, 11, 7>
  - <0, 8, 13, 10, 4>
  - <0, 8, 9, 1, 3>
  - <0, 8, 9, 4, 3>
  - <0, 10, 13, 2, 12>
  - <0, 10, 13, 8, 3>
  - <0, 10, 14, 2, 12>
  - <0, 10, 14, 4, 3>
  - <1, 3, 6, 7, 11>
  - <1, 3, 6, 12, 2>
  - <1, 3, 8, 13, 2>
  - <1, 3, 8, 9, 4>
  - <1, 3, 5, 0, 11>
  - <1, 3, 5, 14, 10>
  - <1, 5, 14, 7, 11>
  - <1, 5, 14, 10, 0>
  - <1, 9, 8, 13, 2>
  - <1, 9, 8, 3, 4>
  - <1, 12, 2, 13, 8>
  - <1, 12, 2, 4, 3>
  - <2, 4, 9, 8, 13>
  - <2, 4, 9, 1, 3>
  - <2, 4, 14, 7, 11>
  - <2, 4, 14, 10, 0>
  - <2, 12, 6, 3, 1>
  - <2, 12, 6, 7, 11>
  - <2, 13, 8, 3, 1>
  - <2, 13, 10, 4, 3>
  - <3, 1, 9, 8, 13>
  - <3, 4, 9, 8, 13>
  - <3, 5, 0, 11, 7>
  - <3, 5, 0, 10, 14>
  - <3, 6, 7, 11, 0>
  - <3, 6, 7, 14, 10>
  - <3, 8, 9, 1, 12>
  - <3, 8, 9, 4, 10>
  - <3, 12, 6, 7, 11>
  - <4, 2, 13, 8, 3>
  - <4, 10, 0, 8, 13>
  - <5, 1, 9, 8, 13>
  - <5, 14, 7, 11, 0>

Step 2:
- Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle, we find the following unique chordal 4-cycles:
  - <0, 11, 13, 8, 9>
  - <0, 8, 13, 11, 7>
  - <1, 3, 6, 7, 11>
  - <1, 3, 8, 13, 2>
  - <1, 3, 5, 14, 10>
  - <1, 9, 8, 13, 2>
  - <2, 4, 9, 1, 3>
  - <2, 4, 14, 7, 11>
  - <2, 13, 8, 3, 1>
  - <2, 13, 10, 4, 3>
  - <3, 8, 9, 1, 12>
  - <5, 1, 9, 8, 13>

Step 3:
- Counting the number of unique chordal 4-cycles found, we have a total of [12].
