Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <0, 12, 11, 14>
2. <0, 12, 7, 1>
3. <0, 12, 7, 11>
4. <0, 12, 11, 6>
5. <0, 14, 11, 6>
6. <1, 8, 13, 10>
7. <1, 8, 5, 4>
8. <1, 14, 11, 6>
9. <2, 6, 9, 4>
10. <2, 6, 11, 13>
11. <2, 6, 5, 8>
12. <2, 6, 9, 4>
13. <2, 6, 11, 14>
14. <2, 9, 4, 5>
15. <2, 9, 4, 0>
16. <2, 9, 4, 10>
17. <2, 9, 6, 11>
18. <2, 10, 13, 8>
19. <2, 10, 13, 11>
20. <2, 10, 5, 8>
21. <2, 10, 5, 4>
22. <2, 10, 5, 4>
23. <3, 8, 5, 4>
24. <3, 8, 13, 10>
25. <3, 8, 5, 10>
26. <3, 8, 13, 11>
27. <3, 7, 11, 14>
28. <3, 7, 11, 6>
29. <3, 7, 12, 11>
30. <4, 9, 6, 11>
31. <4, 9, 6, 5>
32. <4, 9, 6, 11>
33. <4, 9, 6, 2>
34. <4, 5, 8, 13>
35. <4, 5, 10, 13>
36. <4, 5, 10, 0>
37. <5, 6, 9, 2>
38. <5, 6, 2, 10>
39. <5, 6, 2, 11>
40. <5, 8, 13, 10>
41. <5, 8, 13, 11>
42. <5, 8, 1, 7>
43. <6, 2, 11, 14>
44. <7, 1, 14, 11>
45. <8, 13, 10, 2>
46. <9, 6, 2, 10>
47. <10, 13, 8, 1>
48. <11, 6, 2, 10>
49. <11, 6, 2, 9>
50. <11, 7, 3, 0>
51. <11, 7, 3, 8>
52. <11, 7, 3, 0>
53. <11, 7, 12, 0>
54. <13, 8, 1, 14>

Step 2:
Out of the cycles listed above, the chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. <2, 6, 9, 4, (2, 9)>
2. <2, 6, 9, 4, (6, 4)>

Step 3:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final number is [2].
