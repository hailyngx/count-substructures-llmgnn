Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 13, 5, 7> with chord (13, 7)
- Cycle 2: <0, 13, 3, 12> with chord (13, 12)
- Cycle 3: <0, 13, 5, 12> with chord (13, 12)
- Cycle 4: <1, 13, 3, 12> with chord (13, 12)
- Cycle 5: <1, 13, 5, 7> with chord (13, 7)
- Cycle 6: <2, 4, 11, 7> with chord (4, 11)
- Cycle 7: <2, 4, 9, 11> with chord (4, 11)
- Cycle 8: <3, 4, 7, 12> with chord (4, 7)
- Cycle 9: <4, 7, 11, 9> with chord (7, 9)
- Cycle 10: <4, 9, 8, 6> with chord (9, 6)
- Cycle 11: <4, 10, 13, 5> with chord (10, 5)
- Cycle 12: <5, 7, 12, 3> with chord (7, 12)
- Cycle 13: <5, 12, 6, 8> with chord (12, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- The chordal 4-cycles are: <0, 13, 5, 7> (13, 7), <0, 13, 3, 12> (13, 12), <1, 13, 5, 7> (13, 7), <2, 4, 9, 11> (4, 11), <3, 4, 7, 12> (4, 7), <4, 9, 8, 6> (9, 6), <5, 12, 6, 8> (12, 6)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [7]
