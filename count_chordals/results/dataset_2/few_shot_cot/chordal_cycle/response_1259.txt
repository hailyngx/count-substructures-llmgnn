Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 8) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 1) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 2) (3, 0) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 2, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 4, 9, 5, 1>
- <1, 5, 9, 6, 7>
- <2, 5, 9, 6, 3>
- <4, 9, 6, 8, 8>
- <5, 9, 4, 0, 1>
- <5, 9, 6, 3, 2>
- <6, 9, 7, 5, 1>
- <6, 9, 7, 5, 2>
  
Step 2:
Checking each cycle for a chord:
- <0, 4, 9, 5, 1> has a chord (4, 5)
- <1, 5, 9, 6, 7> has a chord (5, 6)
- <2, 5, 9, 6, 3> has a chord (5, 6)
- <4, 9, 6, 8, 8> has no chord
- <5, 9, 4, 0, 1> has a chord (0, 4)
- <5, 9, 6, 3, 2> has a chord (9, 3)
- <6, 9, 7, 5, 1> has a chord (9, 7)
- <6, 9, 7, 5, 2> has no chord

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <4, 9, 6, 8, 8>
- <6, 9, 7, 5, 2>
