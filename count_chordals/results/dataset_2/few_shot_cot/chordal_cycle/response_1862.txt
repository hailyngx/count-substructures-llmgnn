Response:
Step 1:  
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. (3, 0, 6, 5)
2. (3, 0, 1, 6)
3. (3, 0, 12, 14)
4. (0, 1, 6, 5)
5. (0, 1, 2, 6)
6. (0, 1, 5, 7)
7. (1, 2, 6, 5)
8. (1, 2, 7, 5)
9. (2, 6, 5, 7)
10. (2, 6, 9, 7)
11. (4, 7, 5, 9)
12. (4, 9, 6, 7)
13. (4, 9, 7, 5)
14. (5, 6, 9, 4)
15. (5, 7, 4, 9)
16. (5, 7, 9, 6)
17. (6, 9, 4, 7)
18. (6, 9, 5, 7)
19. (7, 9, 4, 5)
20. (11, 4, 7, 5)
21. (11, 4, 14, 13)
22. (11, 10, 13, 8)
23. (12, 11, 4, 14)
24. (12, 11, 13, 8)
25. (12, 8, 13, 14)
26. (13, 8, 12, 14)
27. (13, 8, 2, 1)
28. (13, 10, 11, 4)
29. (14, 12, 0, 3)
30. (14, 12, 11, 13)

Step 2: 
From the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
<11, (13, 8), 12>

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have one chordal 4-cycle which is [1].
