Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 17, 4, 14, 15>
- Cycle 2: <0, 17, 4, 16, 9>
- Cycle 3: <1, 8, 13, 3, 10>
- Cycle 4: <1, 8, 16, 4, 2>
- Cycle 5: <3, 13, 8, 16, 4>
- Cycle 6: <3, 13, 19, 12, 15>
- Cycle 7: <3, 10, 15, 12, 19>
- Cycle 8: <9, 16, 1, 2, 10>

Step 2: Checking for chords:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (14,15)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (16,9)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (8,13)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (1,2)
- Cycle 5 has a chord (8,16)
- Cycle 6 has a chord (13,12)
- Cycle 7 has a chord (15,12)
- Cycle 8 has a chord (1,10)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
