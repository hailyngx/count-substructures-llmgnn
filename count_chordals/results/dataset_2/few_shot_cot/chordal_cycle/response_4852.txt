Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 1) (8, 2) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 1) (5, 3) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 3) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 2) (0, 7) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 7) (3, 6) (3, 5) (3, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 5, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 2, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <0, 2, 3, 5> with non-adjacent chord (0, 5).

Following Step 1 to Step 3, we find that there is 1 chordal 4-cycle in the graph. Therefore, the final count is [1].
