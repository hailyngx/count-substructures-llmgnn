Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 or more in the graph, such as:
1. Cycle: 9 - 26 - 3 - 4 - 19 - 9
2. Cycle: 6 - 9 - 26 - 3 - 6
3. Cycle: 6 - 15 - 21 - 10 - 6
4. Cycle: 1 - 15 - 21 - 10 - 1
5. Cycle: 1 - 28 - 25 - 22 - 16 - 1
6. Cycle: 11 - 19 - 9 - 26 - 0 - 25 - 22 - 11
7. Cycle: 8 - 9 - 26 - 3 - 24 - 8

Step 2:
From the cycles listed above, the cycle <6, 9, 26, 3, 6> has exactly one chord 26-3.

Step 3:
Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1]. 
The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <6, 9, 26, 3, 6>.
