Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

1. <0, 14, 3, 1, 12>
2. <0, 14, 3, 12, 4>
3. <0, 14, 3, 7, 17>
4. <0, 13, 9, 2, 1>
5. <0, 13, 9, 2, 16>
6. <0, 13, 9, 2, 6>
7. <0, 13, 16, 4, 6>
8. <0, 8, 9, 2, 1>
9. <0, 8, 9, 2, 16>
10. <0, 8, 9, 2, 6>
11. <0, 8, 14, 3, 7>
12. <1, 2, 9, 8, 14>
13. <1, 2, 9, 13, 6>
14. <1, 12, 3, 14, 0>
15. <3, 7, 17, 19, 18>
16. <4, 12, 1, 2, 6>
17. <5, 15, 8, 9, 2>
18. <5, 15, 18, 19, 17>
19. <6, 2, 9, 13, 0>
20. <6, 13, 9, 8, 14>
21. <8, 9, 2, 16, 4>
22. <15, 5, 9, 13, 0>
23. <15, 5, 9, 8, 14>
24. <15, 18, 19, 17, 7>

Next, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord. Chordal 4-cycles are:

1. <1, 2, 9, 8> with chord (8, 14)
2. <1, 2, 9, 13> with chord (9, 8)
3. <5, 9, 2, 8> with chord (15, 8)
4. <5, 9, 2, 16> with chord (9, 8)
5. <5, 9, 2, 13> with chord (9, 8)
6. <5, 15, 8, 9> with chord (5, 9)

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [6].
