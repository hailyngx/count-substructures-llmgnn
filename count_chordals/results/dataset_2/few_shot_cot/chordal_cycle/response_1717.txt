Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 7, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 8 - 1 - 0
- Cycle 2: 0 - 4 - 2 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 3: 0 - 1 - 5 - 2 - 0
- Cycle 4: 1 - 5 - 2 - 7 - 1
- Cycle 5: 1 - 5 - 4 - 9 - 6 - 1
- Cycle 6: 1 - 6 - 3 - 4 - 1
- Cycle 7: 2 - 5 - 4 - 9 - 2
- Cycle 8: 2 - 4 - 8 - 3 - 2
- Cycle 9: 2 - 4 - 3 - 6 - 1 - 2
- Cycle 10: 3 - 6 - 9 - 7 - 3
- Cycle 11: 3 - 8 - 4 - 9 - 3

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 4 - 8 - 1 - 0 has a chord 4 - 1
- Cycle 2: 0 - 4 - 2 - 5 - 0 has a chord 4 - 5
- Cycle 3: 0 - 1 - 5 - 2 - 0 has a chord 1 - 2
- Cycle 4: 1 - 5 - 2 - 7 - 1 has a chord 5 - 7
- Cycle 5: 1 - 5 - 4 - 9 - 6 - 1 has a chord 5 - 9
- Cycle 7: 2 - 5 - 4 - 9 - 2 has a chord 5 - 9
- Cycle 8: 2 - 4 - 8 - 3 - 2 has a chord 4 - 3
- Cycle 9: 2 - 4 - 3 - 6 - 1 - 2 has a chord 4 - 6
- Cycle 10: 3 - 6 - 9 - 7 - 3 has a chord 6 - 7

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
<0, (4, 1), 8, 0>
<0, (4, 5), 2, 0>
<0, 1, (5, 2), 0>
<1, (5, 7), 2, 1>
<1, (5, 9), 4, 6, 1>
<2, (5, 9), 4, 2>
<2, 4, (3, 6), 1, 2>
<2, (4, 3), 8, 2>
<3, (6, 7), 9, 3>
