Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle <0, 7, 8, 3, 10, 1, 13, 12, 14, 5>
- Cycle <0, 7, 8, 17, 15, 19, 4, 9>
- Cycle <0, 7, 8, 17, 14, 12, 13, 1, 10>
- Cycle <0, 12, 14, 5, 19, 4>
- Cycle <0, 12, 13, 6, 16>
- Cycle <0, 18, 7, 8, 17, 15, 19, 4>
- Cycle <0, 18, 7, 8, 17, 14, 12, 13>
- Cycle <1, 10, 16, 11, 13, 6>
- Cycle <1, 13, 11, 16, 10, 3>
- Cycle <3, 10, 16, 11, 13, 6>
- Cycle <4, 19, 0, 12, 13, 6>
- Cycle <4, 19, 15, 17, 8, 11>
- Cycle <5, 14, 12, 0, 7, 8>
- Cycle <6, 11, 16, 10, 3, 4>
- Cycle <6, 13, 12, 14, 17, 8>
- Cycle <7, 8, 17, 15, 19, 0>
- Cycle <9, 4, 19, 15, 17, 8>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- <0, 7, 8, 3, 10, 1, 13, 12, 14, 5> has chord (3, 10)
- <0, 7, 8, 17, 15, 19, 4, 9> has chord (17, 15)
- <0, 12, 14, 5, 19, 4> has chord (5, 19)
- <1, 10, 16, 11, 13, 6> has chord (11, 16)
- <1, 13, 11, 16, 10, 3> has chord (3, 10)
- <3, 10, 16, 11, 13, 6> has chord (11, 16)
- <4, 19, 0, 12, 13, 6> has chord (4, 19)
- <5, 14, 12, 0, 7, 8> has chord (5, 14)
- <7, 8, 17, 15, 19, 0> has chord (15, 19)
- <9, 4, 19, 15, 17, 8> has chord (9, 4)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [10].
