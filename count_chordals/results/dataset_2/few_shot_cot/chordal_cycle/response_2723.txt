Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 0) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 1) (0, 6) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 0) (6, 7) (6, 1) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3)

Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, and node 2
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 0, 7, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 1, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle <0, 4, 8, 1>
- Cycle <0, 4, 6, 1>
- Cycle <0, 4, 6, 7>
- Cycle <1, 4, 6, 7>
- Cycle <2, 4, 6, 7>
- Cycle <2, 4, 8, 9>
- Cycle <2, 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle <2, 4, 3, 9>
- Cycle <2, 4, 3, 9>
- Cycle <2, 7, 6, 4>

Step 2:
Identifying the cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, (8, 4), 1>
- <0, (4, 6), 1>
- <0, (4, 6), 7>
- <1, (6, 4), 7>
- <2, (4, 8), 9>
- <2, (4, 8), 0>
- <2, (4, 3), 9>
- <2, (4, 3), 9>
- <2, (7, 6), 4>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles: [9]
