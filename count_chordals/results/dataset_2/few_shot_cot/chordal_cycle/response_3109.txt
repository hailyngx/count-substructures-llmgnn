Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 5, 3, 2, 9>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 5, 12, 9>
- Cycle 3: <0, 10, 6, 14, 7, 5>
- Cycle 4: <0, 10, 1, 14, 7, 5>
- Cycle 5: <4, 7, 5, 12, 13, 11>
- Cycle 6: <6, 14, 7, 5, 12, 13>
- Cycle 7: <0, 10, 1, 11, 13, 12>
- Cycle 8: <0, 10, 6, 14, 1, 11>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Checking Cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 5, 3, 2, 9> - Chord: (4, 5)
- Checking Cycle 2: <0, 4, 7, 5, 12, 9> - Chord: (4, 5)
- Checking Cycle 3: <0, 10, 6, 14, 7, 5> - Chord: (10, 7)
- Checking Cycle 4: <0, 10, 1, 14, 7, 5> - Chord: (10, 14)
- Checking Cycle 5: <4, 7, 5, 12, 13, 11> - Chord: (7, 12)
- Checking Cycle 6: <6, 14, 7, 5, 12, 13> - Chord: (14, 5)
- Checking Cycle 7: <0, 10, 1, 11, 13, 12> - Chord: (11, 1)
- Checking Cycle 8: <0, 10, 6, 14, 1, 11> - Chord: (10, 14)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 2 chordless 4-cycles found in the graph, therefore, the final count is [2]. 

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, 4, 7, 5, 3, 2, 9> (Chord: (4, 5))
2. <0, 4, 7, 5, 12, 9> (Chord: (4, 5))
