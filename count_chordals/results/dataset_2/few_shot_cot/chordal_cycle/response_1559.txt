Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 5) (1, 5) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 2) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (9, 3) (9, 8) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 5, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, 2, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, 2, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 8, 1, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 1, 8, 4>
- Cycle 3: <0, 2, 7, 3, 6>
- Cycle 4: <1, 8, 2, 7, 3>
- Cycle 5: <2, 3, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 6: <4, 7, 3, 6, 5>
- Cycle 7: <4, 8, 2, 7, 6>
- Cycle 8: <5, 6, 7, 4, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- The cycles with exactly one chord are: <0, 4, 8, 1, 5> (chord: edge 4-1), and <0, 5, 1, 8, 4> (chord: edge 5-8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- As there are 8 cycles and 2 of them have chords, the number of chordless cycles is 8 - 2 = 6.

So, the final answer is [6].
