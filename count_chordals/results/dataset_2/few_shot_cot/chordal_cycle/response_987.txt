Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 in the graph:

- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 1, 14, 4, 12, 15, 8, 13, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 1, 14, 4, 19, 17, 9, 10, 11>
- Cycle 3: <0, 11, 10, 9, 6, 2, 18, 3, 1, 14>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 14, 1, 3, 6, 2, 18, 9, 10>
- Cycle 5: <0, 4, 19, 5, 6, 2, 18, 3, 1, 14>
- Cycle 6: <3, 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, 11, 5, 19, 17>
- Cycle 7: <3, 1, 14, 4, 19, 5, 11, 10, 9, 6>
- Cycle 8: <3, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 8, 15, 12, 4>
- Cycle 9: <5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 7, 8, 15, 12>

Next, let's identify the chordal 4-cycles, where each cycle has exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 3, 1, 14> with chord (4, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 3, 1, 14> with chord (4, 19)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 3, 6, 9> with chord (10, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 4, 14, 1> with chord (3, 6)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, 4, 19, 5> with chord (6, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, 3, 6, 9> with chord (2, 18)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, 14, 4, 19> with chord (5, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <3, 6, 9, 10> with chord (11, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <3, 6, 9, 10> with chord (11, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <5, 6, 9, 10> with chord (11, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <5, 6, 9, 10> with chord (11, 13)

There are 11 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final answer is [11].
