Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (8, 0) (5, 6) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 0) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 6) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 2) (0, 8) (0, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 5, 1, 3, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 3, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 4, 0, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 5, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 7, 4, 1, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 8, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 2, 9, 4, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 2, 9, 6, 5, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 9, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 9, 4, 3, 2>
- Cycle 8: <2, 6, 5, 7, 8, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chord.
- Cycle 2 has no chord.
- Cycle 3 has no chord.
- Cycle 4 has no chord.
- Cycle 5 has one chord: <0, (1, 2), 9, 6, 5, 0>
- Cycle 6 has one chord: <1, (4, 9), 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 7 has one chord: <2, 6, 9, (4, 3), 2>
- Cycle 8 has one chord: <2, (6, 5), 7, 8, 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [3].
