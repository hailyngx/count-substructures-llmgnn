Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- <0, 17, 22, 13>
- <0, 17, 14, 7>
- <0, 19, 3, 25>
- <1, 16, 15, 5>
- <1, 16, 29, 27>
- <1, 11, 13, 22>
- <1, 11, 21, 20>
- <2, 21, 20, 14>
- <3, 25, 29, 27>
- <8, 6, 23, 9>
- <10, 18, 22, 13>
- <10, 18, 25, 3>
- <10, 20, 14, 17>
- <10, 1, 16, 15>
- <11, 13, 4, 9>
- <11, 19, 3, 25>
- <12, 1, 16, 15>
- <12, 9, 4, 13>
- <14, 17, 22, 13>
- <15, 16, 1, 11>
- <15, 20, 14, 7>
- <16, 1, 11, 22>
- <16, 29, 27, 22>
- <17, 22, 13, 4>
- <18, 22, 13, 4>
- <18, 25, 29, 27>
- <19, 3, 25, 10>
- <20, 14, 17, 0>
- <20, 15, 16, 1>
- <21, 11, 19, 0>
- <21, 28, 20, 10>
- <23, 6, 8, 3>
- <23, 9, 4, 13>
- <25, 18, 22, 13>
- <25, 3, 19, 11>
- <27, 22, 13, 4>
- <27, 29, 25, 18>
- <29, 16, 1, 10>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, 17, (8, 19), 3>
- <1, 16, (12, 9), 29>
- <1, 11, (21, 20), 10>
- <10, 18, (25, 3), 29>
- <12, 1, (16, 15), 5>
- <14, 17, (22, 13), 4>
- <15, 16, (1, 11), 22>
- <16, 1, (11, 22), 13>
- <20, 14, (17, 0), 19>
- <23, 9, (4, 13), 22>
- <27, 22, (13, 4), 9>

Step 3:
There are 11 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [11].
