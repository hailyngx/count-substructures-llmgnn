- Cycle 8: (5, 4, 1, 6, 5)
- Cycle 9: (5, 4, 2, 6, 5)
- Cycle 10: (9, 6, 1, 3, 9)
- Cycle 11: (9, 6, 7, 2, 9)
- Cycle 12: (9, 6, 8, 3, 9)
- Cycle 13: (9, 3, 1, 6, 9)
- Cycle 14: (9, 3, 0, 1, 9)
- Cycle 15: (9, 3, 8, 5, 9)
- Cycle 16: (9, 3, 0, 8, 9)
- Cycle 17: (6, 1, 0, 3, 6)
- Cycle 18: (6, 1, 4, 2, 6)
- Cycle 19: (6, 1, 3, 9, 6)
- Cycle 20: (6, 1, 3, 8, 6)
- Cycle 21: (6, 7, 2, 5, 6)
- Cycle 22: (6, 7, 0, 1, 6)
- Cycle 23: (6, 7, 4, 2, 6)
- Cycle 24: (6, 8, 3, 9, 6)
- Cycle 25: (6, 8, 0, 1, 6)
- Cycle 26: (6, 8, 5, 9, 6)
- Cycle 27: (1, 3, 0, 1)

- Cycle 35: (8, 0, 7, 8)
- Cycle 36: (8, 0, 3, 8)
- Cycle 37: (8, 5, 6, 8)
- Cycle 38: (0, 7, 6, 0)
- Cycle 39: (0, 7, 4, 0)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 5: (5, 2, 7, 6, 5) with the chord (2, 6)
- The only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 6: (5, 2, 4, 6, 5) with the chord (2, 4)
- The only cycle with exactly one chord is Cycle 21: (6, 7, 2, 5, 6) with the chord (7, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are three unique chordal 4-cycles found. Therefore, the number inside brackets is [3].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <5, 2, (7, 6), 5>
- <5, 2, (4, 6), 5>
- <6, 7, (2, 5), 6>
