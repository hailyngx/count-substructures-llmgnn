Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 8, 17, 10, 3>
- <0, 8, 5, 13, 19>
- <0, 1, 10, 17, 12>
- <1, 10, 3, 5, 13>
- <1, 10, 17, 12, 15>
- <1, 10, 17, 9, 16>
- <1, 5, 13, 19, 11>
- <1, 5, 8, 0, 18>
- <3, 10, 17, 12, 16>
- <5, 8, 17, 12, 16>
- <8, 17, 10, 3, 2>
- <11, 16, 12, 17, 10>
  
Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 8, 17, 10, 3> has a chord: (3, 10)
- <0, 8, 5, 13, 19> has a chord: (5, 13)
- <0, 1, 10, 17, 12> has a chord: (1, 17)
- <1, 10, 3, 5, 13> is chordal
- <1, 10, 17, 12, 15> has a chord: (10, 12)
- <1, 10, 17, 9, 16> has a chord: (9, 17)
- <1, 5, 13, 19, 11> has a chord: (13, 19)
- <1, 5, 8, 0, 18> is chordal
- <3, 10, 17, 12, 16> has a chord: (10, 17)
- <5, 8, 17, 12, 16> has a chord: (8, 12)
- <8, 17, 10, 3, 2> has a chord: (8, 10)
- <11, 16, 12, 17, 10> has a chord: (12, 17)
  
Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <1, 10, 3, 5, 13>
- <1, 5, 8, 0, 18>
