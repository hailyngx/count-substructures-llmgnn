Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 8) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 4) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 4) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 6, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 8, 1, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, and node 4
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, and node 7

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:
1. <1, (2, 6), 7>
2. <1, (2, 5), 7>
  
Since both cycles have one chord, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [2].
