Step 2: Check for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 11, 4, 2, (17, 14)>
- <1, 19, 26, 11, (8, 25)>
- <1, 19, 5, 7, (18, 24)>
- <1, 15, 25, 8, (21, 12)>
- <2, 4, 11, 26, (8, 25)>
- <5, 7, 6, 22, (18, 29)>
- <5, 19, 26, 11, (8, 25)>
- <21, 25, 8, 26, (19, 1)>
- <23, 9, 10, 27, (14, 17)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are 9 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [9].
