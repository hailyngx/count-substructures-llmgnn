Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (1, 9) (1, 2) (1, 4) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 8) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 1) (2, 8) (0, 4) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 2, and node 4
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, 4, 2, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more:
1. (1, 4, 5, 3, 1)
2. (1, 4, 8, 5, 1)
3. (1, 9, 5, 4, 1)
4. (3, 4, 5, 9, 3)
5. (3, 5, 6, 8, 3)
6. (4, 5, 6, 8, 4)
7. (4, 5, 8, 3, 4)
8. (4, 8, 6, 5, 4)
9. (5, 6, 8, 3, 5)
10. (1, 9, 3, 5, 1)

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 4, 8, 5> (chord: 4, 8)
- <3, 4, 5, 9> (chord: 3, 9)
- <4, 5, 8, 3> (chord: 4, 8)
- <5, 6, 8, 3> (chord: 5, 8)

Step 3:
There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [4].
