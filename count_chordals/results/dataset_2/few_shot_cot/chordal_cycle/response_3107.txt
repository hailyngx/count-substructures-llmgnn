This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 2) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 7) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 1) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 6) (7, 3) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 6, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 6, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 6, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 7, 2>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 6, 9>
- Cycle 5: <1, 3, 6, 9>
- Cycle 6: <1, 0, 9, 3>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 5, 7>
- Cycle 8: <2, 6, 3, 7>
- Cycle 9: <2, 4, 5, 7>
- Cycle 10: <3, 9, 6, 2>
- Cycle 11: <3, 9, 7, 2>
- Cycle 12: <5, 6, 2, 4>
- Cycle 13: <5, 7, 2, 6>
- Cycle 14: <5, 1, 3, 6>
- Cycle 15: <5, 1, 0, 9>
- Cycle 16: <6, 5, 7, 2>
- Cycle 17: <6, 9, 3, 1>
- Cycle 18: <6, 9, 7, 2>
- Cycle 19: <7, 5, 1, 3>
- Cycle 20: <7, 2, 6, 5>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, 5, 6, 9> has a chord: (5, 9)
- <2, 6, 3, 7> has a chord: (6, 7)
- <5, 1, 0, 9> has a chord: (1, 9)
- <7, 2, 6, 5> has a chord: (2, 5)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles: [16]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
- <0, 9, 6, 5> into [1]
- <0, 9, 3, 1>
- <0, 9, 7, 2>
- <2, 4, 5, 7>
- <3, 9, 6, 2>
- <3, 9, 7, 2>
- <5, 6, 2, 4>
- <5, 7, 2, 6>
- <5, 1, 3, 6>
- <6, 5, 7, 2>
- <6, 9, 3, 1>
- <6, 9, 7, 2>
- <7, 5, 1, 3>
- <1, 3, 6, 9>
- <1, 0, 9, 3>
- <2, 6, 5, 7>
