Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 8) (6, 1) (2, 5) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (7, 3) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 0) (3, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 4, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 0, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, 1, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: 0-9-4-2-0
- Cycle 2: 1-9-4-6-1
- Cycle 3: 2-5-9-3-2
- Cycle 4: 3-5-9-0-3

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <0, (4, 2), 9> (Cycle 1 has one chord 4-2)
- <1, (4, 6), 9> (Cycle 2 has one chord 4-6)
- <2, (3, 9), 5> (Cycle 3 has one chord 3-9)
- <3, (0, 9), 5> (Cycle 4 has one chord 0-9)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count is [4].
