Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 5) (3, 8) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 0) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (8, 3) (8, 9) (8, 2) (0, 4) (0, 1) (0, 9) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 1, 9, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 5, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 1, 9, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 8 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-4-7-3-1-0
- Cycle 2: 0-4-7-6-1-0
- Cycle 3: 0-4-2-5-3-0
- Cycle 4: 2-5-3-8-9-2
- Cycle 5: 2-5-3-7-6-2
- Cycle 6: 2-5-0-4-7-2
- Cycle 7: 5-3-4-7-6-5
- Cycle 8: 5-3-1-6-7-5

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has 1 chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 2 has 1 chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (2, 5)
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (8, 3)
- Cycle 5 has 1 chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 6 has 1 chord: (0, 5)
- Cycle 7 has 1 chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 8 has 1 chord: (3, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [0].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, (1, 3)>
<2, (1, 6)>
<3, (2, 5)>
<4, (8, 3)>
<5, (4, 7)>
<6, (0, 5)>
<7, (4, 7)>
<8, (3, 6)>
