Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 7) (3, 0) (3, 8) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 6) (8, 2) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 6) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-5-9-4-7-3-0
- Cycle 2: 0-1-5-9-6-2-0
- Cycle 3: 3-7-4-9-6-2-3
- Cycle 4: 4-7-9-6-1-0-4
- Cycle 5: 4-7-3-5-1-6-4
- Cycle 6: 6-1-5-9-4-7-6

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the following cycle is chordal:
<6, (1, 9), 4>

Step 3:
Therefore, there is only 1 chordal 4-cycle in the given graph, which can be represented as <6, (1, 9), 4>.
So, the final count is [1].
