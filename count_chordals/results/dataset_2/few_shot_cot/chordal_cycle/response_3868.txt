Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 11) (14, 9) (14, 12) (17, 16) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 19) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 16) (3, 5) (3, 4) (5, 3) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 18) (5, 16) (6, 5) (6, 13) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 15) (13, 18) (10, 15) (10, 18) (15, 13) (15, 10) (15, 7) (15, 4) (4, 3) (4, 15) (4, 12) (12, 14) (12, 4) (12, 0) (11, 14) (11, 19) (11, 9) (11, 2) (19, 1) (19, 11) (16, 17) (16, 3) (16, 5) (16, 2) (2, 1) (2, 11) (2, 16) (2, 9) (8, 1) (8, 18) (7, 15) (9, 14) (9, 11) (9, 2) (18, 5) (18, 13) (18, 10) (18, 8) (0, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 12

Node 10 is connected to node 15, and node 18
Node 11 is connected to node 14, 19, 9, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 14, 4, and node 0
Node 13 is connected to node 5, 6, 15, and node 18
Node 14 is connected to node 11, 9, and node 12
Node 15 is connected to node 13, 10, 7, and node 4
Node 16 is connected to node 17, 3, 5, and node 2
Node 17 is connected to node 16
Node 18 is connected to node 5, 13, 10, and node 8
Node 19 is connected to node 1, and node 11

Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in this graph are as follows:
1. <1, 3, 5, 16> with chord (1, 16)
2. <5, 3, 4, 15> with chord (3, 15)
3. <18, 5, 13, 10> with chord (5, 10)
4. <18, 10, 15, 13> with chord (10, 15)
5. <9, 14, 12, 0> with chord (14, 0)

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
