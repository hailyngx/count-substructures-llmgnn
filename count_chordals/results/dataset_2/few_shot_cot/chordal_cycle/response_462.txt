Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 7, 12, 4, 5>
2. <0, 7, 12, 11, 14>
3. <0, 10, 6, 5, 8>
4. <0, 10, 6, 9, 13>
5. <0, 10, 5, 4, 12>
6. <1, 2, 7, 12, 11>
7. <1, 8, 5, 4, 12>
8. <1, 8, 14, 11, 12>
9. <2, 7, 12, 11, 14>
10. <3, 0, 7, 12, 4>
11. <3, 0, 12, 11, 14>
12. <3, 5, 4, 12, 11>
13. <3, 8, 5, 4, 12>
14. <4, 5, 8, 14, 11>
15. <5, 6, 9, 13, 12>
16. <8, 5, 4, 12, 11>
17. <8, 9, 6, 13, 12>
18. <8, 14, 11, 12, 7>
19. <9, 6, 10, 0, 7>
20. <9, 6, 13, 12, 7>
21. <10, 6, 9, 8, 5>
22. <10, 6, 13, 12, 0>
23. <11, 12, 7, 2, 1>
24. <11, 12, 4, 5, 8>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <0, 7, 12, 11, 14>, with chord 11 as the non-adjacent edge.

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [23].
