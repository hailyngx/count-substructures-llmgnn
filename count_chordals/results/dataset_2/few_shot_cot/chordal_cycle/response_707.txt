Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (4, 5, 2, 7, 4)
- (4, 7, 11, 1, 4)
- (4, 7, 14, 13, 4)
- (4, 11, 8, 10, 4)
- (5, 4, 7, 11, 5)
- (5, 2, 7, 14, 5)
- (7, 14, 13, 1, 7)
- (8, 10, 6, 14, 8)
- (9, 1, 4, 12, 9)
- (10, 6, 3, 4, 10)
- (11, 7, 2, 5, 11)
- (12, 4, 3, 6, 12)
- (13, 1, 14, 7, 13)
- (14, 6, 0, 5, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- (4, 5, 2, 7, 4) has chord (5, 7)
- (4, 7, 11, 1, 4) has chord (7, 1)
- (4, 7, 14, 13, 4) has chord (7, 13)
- (4, 11, 8, 10, 4) has chord (11, 8)
- (5, 4, 7, 11, 5) has no chord
- (5, 2, 7, 14, 5) has no chord
- (7, 14, 13, 1, 7) has chord (14, 1)
- (8, 10, 6, 14, 8) has chord (10, 14)
- (9, 1, 4, 12, 9) has no chord
- (10, 6, 3, 4, 10) has no chord
- (11, 7, 2, 5, 11) has chord (7, 2)
- (12, 4, 3, 6, 12) has no chord
- (13, 1, 14, 7, 13) has chord (1, 7)
- (14, 6, 0, 5, 14) has chord (6, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which are:
- (5, 4, 7, 11, 5)
- (5, 2, 7, 14, 5)
- (9, 1, 4, 12, 9)
- (10, 6, 3, 4, 10)
- (12, 4, 3, 6, 12)

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [5]. The unique chordal 4-cycles found are:
- <5, 2, 7, 14, 5>
- <5, 4, 7, 11, 5>
- <9, 1, 4, 12, 9>
- <10, 6, 3, 4, 10>
- <12, 4, 3, 6, 12>
