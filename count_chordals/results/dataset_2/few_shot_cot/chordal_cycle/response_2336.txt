Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 1) (7, 4) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 8) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 6) (2, 0) (8, 5) (8, 9) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 6) (6, 2) (6, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 0, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, 0, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
- There are no cycles of length 4 or more in this graph.

Step 2:
- From the adjacency list provided, we can determine the following 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
  - <0, 2, 5, 8, (0, 5)>
  - <1, 3, 5, 4, (1, 5)>
  - <0, 4, 7, 8, (0, 7)>
  - <1, 4, 0, 3, (1, 4)>
  - <2, 5, 8, 7, (2, 8)>
  - <3, 5, 8, 9, (3, 5)>
  - <1, 4, 7, 8, (1, 7)>

Step 3:
- There are a total of [7] unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.
