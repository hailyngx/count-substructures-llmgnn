Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 4) (6, 13) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 3) (10, 0) (10, 12) (10, 8) (10, 1) (11, 7) (11, 0) (8, 9) (8, 10) (8, 13) (8, 5) (13, 6) (13, 8) (13, 2) (13, 3) (4, 6) (4, 9) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 1) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 12) (5, 1) (0, 10) (0, 11) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 11) (7, 0) (7, 2) (12, 10) (12, 4) (12, 5) (12, 3) (12, 1) (14, 4) (14, 1) (3, 9) (3, 13) (3, 0) (3, 12) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 13) (2, 7) (2, 3) (1, 10) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 12) (1, 14)

Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 10, 1, 4, 6, 9, 3, 12>
- Cycle 2: <0, 10, 1, 5, 12, 4, 6, 9>
- Cycle 3: <0, 11, 7, 2, 6, 9, 3, 12>
- Cycle 4: <0, 11, 7, 2, 13, 6, 9, 3>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (4,6)
- Cycle 2 has a chord (1,5)
- Cycle 3 has a chord (7,2)
- Cycle 4 has a chord (13,6)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
As all cycles have exactly one chord, there are no chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [0].
