Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 0) (3, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (9, 1) (9, 8) (9, 0) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 9) (8, 0) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 6) (2, 5) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 9) (0, 8) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 9, 8, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 2, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 6, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 0, and node 6
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 2, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 9, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 8, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 4, 7, 8>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 2, 5, 4>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 2, 7, 4>
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 2, 6, 3>
- Cycle 6: <0, 3, 6, 2, 5>
- Cycle 7: <0, 3, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 8: <0, 9, 8, 4, 7>
- Cycle 9: <0, 9, 8, 7, 4>
- Cycle 10: <1, 4, 7, 5, 2>
- Cycle 11: <1, 4, 7, 2, 5>
- Cycle 12: <1, 2, 5, 4, 8>
- Cycle 13: <1, 2, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle 14: <1, 2, 6, 3, 0>
- Cycle 15: <1, 2, 6, 0, 3>
- Cycle 16: <1, 9, 8, 4, 7>
- Cycle 17: <1, 9, 8, 7, 4>
- Cycle 18: <2, 4, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 19: <2, 4, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 20: <2, 5, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 21: <2, 5, 7, 1, 4>
- Cycle 22: <2, 5, 0, 3, 6>
- Cycle 23: <2, 5, 0, 6, 3>
- Cycle 24: <2, 6, 0, 3, 1>
- Cycle 25: <2, 6, 0, 1, 3>
- Cycle 26: <4, 7, 2, 5, 0>
- Cycle 27: <4, 7, 2, 1, 0>
- Cycle 28: <5, 7, 4, 1, 2>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Cycle 1: Chord <1, 8>
- Cycle 2: Chord <1, 4>
- Cycle 3: Chord <1, 2>
- Cycle 4: Chord <1, 2>
- Cycle 10: Chord <4, 7>
- Cycle 12: Chord <2, 5>
- Cycle 16: Chord <1, 8>
- Cycle 18: Chord <7, 0>
- Cycle 20: Chord <7, 1>
- Cycle 26: Chord <7, 0>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
- There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [6].
