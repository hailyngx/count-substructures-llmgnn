Response:
Step 1: 
Here are the cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 10, 11, 14, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 2, 4, 1)
- Cycle 3: (1, 5, 3, 4, 1)
- Cycle 4: (1, 5, 3, 7, 11, 10, 1)
- Cycle 5: (4, 3, 5, 2, 4)
- Cycle 6: (4, 3, 7, 11, 10, 5, 3)
- Cycle 7: (4, 3, 8, 7, 11, 14, 4)
- Cycle 8: (4, 9, 6, 1, 5, 3, 4)
- Cycle 9: (4, 9, 12, 6, 1, 5, 4)
- Cycle 10: (6, 0, 12, 9, 4, 1, 6)
- Cycle 11: (6, 1, 5, 3, 7, 11, 6)
- Cycle 12: (6, 1, 7, 11, 14, 4, 6)
- Cycle 13: (6, 9, 12, 0, 6)
- Cycle 14: (7, 3, 5, 2, 7)
- Cycle 15: (14, 11, 7, 3, 5, 1, 14)

Step 2:
After checking each cycle for exactly one chord, we find that there are no unique chordal 4-cycles in the given graph.

Step 3:
Since there are no chordal 4-cycles found, the final count is [0].
