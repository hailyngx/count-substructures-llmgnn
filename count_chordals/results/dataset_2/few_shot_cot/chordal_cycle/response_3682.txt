Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 2, 4, 12, 15, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 17, 14, 11, 7, 19, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 3, 5, 11, 7, 19, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 3, 12, 10, 2, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 9, 19, 7, 6, 5, 3, 12, 10, 2>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord (2, 12).
- Cycle 2 has a chord (7, 14).
- Cycle 3 has a chord (1, 11).
- Cycle 4 has a chord (3, 10).
- Cycle 5 has a chord (3, 10).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
We have found 0 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [0].
