Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 12) (4, 13) (4, 14) (7, 4) (7, 11) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 5) (3, 1) (3, 11) (3, 14) (3, 13) (5, 1) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 2) (5, 14) (6, 7) (6, 5) (6, 2) (6, 11) (6, 12) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 4) (14, 3) (14, 5) (14, 8) (14, 10) (13, 4) (13, 3) (13, 5) (13, 0) (13, 2) (13, 10) (11, 7) (11, 3) (11, 6) (11, 9) (8, 14) (8, 9) (8, 12) (9, 11) (9, 8) (9, 10) (12, 4) (12, 6) (12, 8) (10, 0) (10, 14) (10, 13) (10, 9) (2, 7) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 13)

Node 3 is connected to node 1, 11, 14, and node 13
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 12, 13, and node 14
Node 5 is connected to node 1, 6, 13, 2, and node 14
Node 6 is connected to node 7, 5, 2, 11, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 11, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 14, 9, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 11, 8, and node 10
Node 10 is connected to node 0, 14, 13, and node 9
Node 11 is connected to node 7, 3, 6, and node 9
Node 12 is connected to node 4, 6, and node 8
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 3, 5, 0, 2, and node 10

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 10, 13, 4>
- Cycle 2: <1, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 3: <2, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 4: <3, 1, 7, 4>
- Cycle 5: <4, 7, 6, 5>
- Cycle 6: <5, 6, 7, 4>
- Cycle 7: <6, 7, 4, 14>
- Cycle 8: <7, 4, 14, 8>
- Cycle 9: <8, 14, 10, 0>
- Cycle 10: <9, 11, 7, 1>
- Cycle 11: <10, 0, 13, 3>
- Cycle 12: <11, 7, 4, 14>
- Cycle 13: <12, 4, 7, 6>
- Cycle 14: <13, 4, 7, 1>
- Cycle 15: <14, 4, 7, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- None of the cycles has exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 15 chordless cycles found.

Final answer: [15]
