Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
        - Cycle 1: <0, 5, 3, 1, 14>
        - Cycle 2: <0, 5, 3, 6, 9>
        - Cycle 3: <0, 5, 3, 7, 1>
        - Cycle 4: <0, 5, 3, 13, 6>
        - Cycle 5: <0, 9, 6, 13, 3>
        - Cycle 6: <0, 9, 6, 3, 5>
        - Cycle 7: <0, 9, 8, 13, 6>
        - Cycle 8: <0, 9, 8, 10, 7>
        - Cycle 9: <0, 9, 8, 12, 4>
        - Cycle 10: <0, 9, 2, 11, 10>
        - Cycle 11: <0, 10, 4, 14, 1>
        - Cycle 12: <0, 10, 4, 12, 14>
        - Cycle 13: <0, 8, 13, 12, 4>
        - Cycle 14: <1, 3, 5, 0, 10>
        - Cycle 15: <1, 3, 7, 11, 2>
        
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
        - Chordal cycle 1: <0, 5, 3, (1, 14)>
        - Chordal cycle 2: <0, 5, 3, (6, 9)>
        - Chordal cycle 3: <0, 9, 8, (13, 6)>
        - Chordal cycle 4: <0, 9, 8, (10, 7)>
        - Chordal cycle 5: <0, 9, 8, (12, 4)>
        - Chordal cycle 6: <0, 10, 4, (14, 1)>
        
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
        There are no chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [6].
