Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 9, 8>
- Cycle 2: <2, 8, 9, 12>
- Cycle 3: <5, 13, 12, 9>
- Cycle 4: <6, 26, 25, 11>
- Cycle 5: <7, 3, 22, 12>
- Cycle 6: <10, 6, 26, 25>
- Cycle 7: <14, 24, 17, 20>
- Cycle 8: <15, 13, 5, 4>
- Cycle 9: <16, 17, 24, 29>
- Cycle 10: <18, 20, 17, 16>
- Cycle 11: <19, 4, 5, 15>
- Cycle 12: <21, 20, 18, 10>
- Cycle 13: <22, 8, 2, 11>
- Cycle 14: <23, 26, 6, 15>
- Cycle 15: <27, 6, 26, 25>
- Cycle 16: <28, 25, 26, 23>
- Cycle 17: <29, 21, 20, 17>

Step 2: 
Checking for chords in each cycle:
- <0, 7, 9, 8> has one chord: (7, 9)
- <2, 8, 9, 12> has one chord: (8, 9)
- <5, 13, 12, 9> does not have any chord
- <6, 26, 25, 11> does not have any chord
- <7, 3, 22, 12> has one chord: (7, 22)
- <10, 6, 26, 25> has one chord: (10, 26)
- <14, 24, 17, 20> has one chord: (24, 17)
- <15, 13, 5, 4> has one chord: (13, 5)
- <16, 17, 24, 29> does not have any chord
- <18, 20, 17, 16> has one chord: (20, 17)
- <19, 4, 5, 15> does not have any chord
- <21, 20, 18, 10> does not have any chord
- <22, 8, 2, 11> has one chord: (8, 2)
- <23, 26, 6, 15> does not have any chord
- <27, 6, 26, 25> has one chord: (6, 26)
- <28, 25, 26, 23> has one chord: (25, 26)
- <29, 21, 20, 17> does not have any chord

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found: [6]

Therefore, there are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
