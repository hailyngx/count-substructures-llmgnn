Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 18, 8, 17, 14>
- Cycle 2: <0, 18, 8, 19, 11>
- Cycle 3: <1, 14, 15, 2, 3>
- Cycle 4: <1, 10, 12, 11, 19>
- Cycle 5: <1, 10, 4, 6, 5>
- Cycle 6: <2, 3, 11, 12, 7>
- Cycle 7: <2, 3, 13, 15, 14>
- Cycle 8: <4, 5, 6, 4, 15>
- Cycle 9: <4, 5, 6, 4, 10>
- Cycle 10: <7, 12, 10, 9, 2>
- Cycle 11: <7, 12, 10, 4, 5>
- Cycle 12: <8, 17, 14, 15, 13>
- Cycle 13: <8, 19, 11, 3, 2>
- Cycle 14: <8, 19, 18, 0, 18>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 18, 8, (17, 14)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, 14, 15, (2, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, 10, 12, (11, 19)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, 5, 6, (4, 15)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <7, 12, 10, (9, 2)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <8, 17, 14, (15, 13)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <8, 19, 11, (2, 3)>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
  
- Number of chordal 4-cycles: [7]
