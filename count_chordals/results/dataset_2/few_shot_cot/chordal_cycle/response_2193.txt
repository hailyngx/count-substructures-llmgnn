Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (9, 3), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <1, (7, 12), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (13, 11), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (5, 12), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6, (5, 12), 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, (12, 5), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <4, (5, 13), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <14, (13, 11), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <1, (13, 7), 10>
- Total chordal 4-cycles found: [8]

Therefore, the final answer is [8].
