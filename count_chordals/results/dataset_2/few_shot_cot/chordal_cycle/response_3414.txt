Response:
Step 1:
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 3, 6, 12>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 4, 1>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 4, 5>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 12, 14>
- Cycle 5: <1, 2, 3, 10>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 5, 7>
- Cycle 7: <2, 3, 4, 5>
- Cycle 8: <2, 3, 6, 12>
- Cycle 9: <3, 4, 5, 7>
- Cycle 10: <3, 4, 10, 13>
- Cycle 11: <4, 5, 7, 11>
- Cycle 12: <4, 10, 13, 6>
- Cycle 13: <5, 7, 12, 6>
- Cycle 14: <5, 8, 10, 13>
- Cycle 15: <6, 8, 10, 13>
- Cycle 16: <7, 11, 5, 9>
- Cycle 17: <11, 13, 6, 12>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- One chord for Cycle 6: <1, 4, 5, 7> (Chord: (4, 7))
- One chord for Cycle 10: <3, 4, 5, 7> (Chord: (4, 7))
- One chord for Cycle 14: <5, 8, 10, 13> (Chord: (8, 13))

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [14].
