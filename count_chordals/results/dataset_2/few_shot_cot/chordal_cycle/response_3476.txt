Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 6, 1, 4, 3>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 7, 1, 6>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 8, 2, 9, 6>
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 6, 4, 3, 8>
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 5, 8, 3, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 4, 3, 8, 5>
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 9, 2, 8, 5>
- Cycle 8: <1, 4, 6, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle 9: <2, 9, 6, 5, 8, 3>
- Cycle 10: <3, 4, 6, 1, 7, 0>
  
Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edges in the cycle) are:
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 7, 1, 6> (Chord: (5, 1))
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 8, 2, 9, 6> (Chord: (5, 9))
- Cycle 4: <0, 9, 6, 4, 3, 8> (Chord: (6, 8))
- Cycle 6: <1, 6, 4, 3, 8, 5> (Chord: (6, 5))
- Cycle 7: <1, 6, 9, 2, 8, 5> (Chord: (6, 2))
- Cycle 8: <1, 4, 6, 9, 8, 5> (Chord: (4, 8))
- Cycle 9: <2, 9, 6, 5, 8, 3> (Chord: (9, 8))
- Cycle 10: <3, 4, 6, 1, 7, 0> (Chord: (4, 7))

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles found is [7].

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 5, 8, 7, 1, 6> (Chord: (5, 1))
- <0, 5, 8, 2, 9, 6> (Chord: (5, 9))
- <0, 9, 6, 4, 3, 8> (Chord: (6, 8))
- <1, 6, 4, 3, 8, 5> (Chord: (6, 5))
- <1, 6, 9, 2, 8, 5> (Chord: (6, 2))
- <1, 4, 6, 9, 8, 5> (Chord: (4, 8))
- <2, 9, 6, 5, 8, 3> (Chord: (9, 8))
- <3, 4, 6, 1, 7, 0> (Chord: (4, 7))
