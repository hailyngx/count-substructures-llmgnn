Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
1. <5, (9, 1), 7>
2. <5, (9, 12), 6>
3. <4, (5, 7), 8>
4. <4, (12, 9), 7>
5. <7, (5, 6), 12>
6. <7, (4, 3), 13>
7. <6, (12, 0), 2>
8. <2, (13, 3), 9>
9. <8, (7, 4), 5>
10. <13, (2, 10), 7>

Since we found 10 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, the final count is [10].
