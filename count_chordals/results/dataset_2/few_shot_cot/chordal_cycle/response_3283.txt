Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 0) (3, 5) (3, 7) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 1) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 6) (8, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 7) (7, 5) (7, 3) (7, 0) (7, 2) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 6, 2, 4, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 4, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 4
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (5, 4, 6, 9, 5)
- Cycle 2: (5, 3, 7, 2, 5)
- Cycle 3: (5, 8, 6, 1, 5)
- Cycle 4: (5, 7, 0, 1, 5)
- Cycle 5: (9, 1, 6, 4, 9)
- Cycle 6: (9, 2, 7, 3, 9)
- Cycle 7: (6, 1, 4, 8, 6)
- Cycle 8: (6, 8, 5, 4, 6)
- Cycle 9: (6, 4, 1, 9, 6)
- Cycle 10: (6, 0, 7, 3, 6)
- Cycle 11: (1, 9, 5, 4, 1)
- Cycle 12: (1, 4, 6, 8, 1)
- Cycle 13: (1, 0, 7, 5, 1)
- Cycle 14: (2, 9, 5, 8, 2)
- Cycle 15: (2, 4, 6, 1, 2)
- Cycle 16: (2, 7, 3, 5, 2)
- Cycle 17: (3, 5, 4, 1, 3)
- Cycle 18: (3, 7, 0, 6, 3)

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:
- <1, (6, 8), 5>
- <3, (5, 7), 2>
- <6, (1, 4), 9>
- <7, (0, 1), 5>
- <9, (5, 6), 1>
- <11, (4, 8), 1>
- <13, (2, 8), 5>
- <15, (4, 6), 2>

Step 3:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final answer is [8].
