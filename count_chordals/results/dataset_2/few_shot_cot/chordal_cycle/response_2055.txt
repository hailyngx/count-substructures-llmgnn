Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 7) (8, 6) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 7) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 7) (0, 5) (0, 4) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 8, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 8, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles in the graph, but one of them is a 4-cycle:
1. Cycle: <0, 5, 4, 8, 0>

Step 2: 
Checking for a chord in the cycle <0, 5, 4, 8, 0>:
- Adding a chord connecting non-adjacent nodes, we get two possible chordal 4-cycles:
    <0, (5, 8), 4, 0>
    <0, (5, 4), 8, 0>

Step 3:
There are two unique chordal 4-cycles found, hence the final count is [2].
