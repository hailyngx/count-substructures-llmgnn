Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 16, 13, 2, 3>
- Cycle 2: <0, 13, 15, 1, 5>
- Cycle 3: <0, 13, 16, 12, 9>
- Cycle 4: <1, 15, 6, 11, 17>
- Cycle 5: <1, 12, 9, 5, 3>
- Cycle 6: <1, 18, 8, 4, 7>
- Cycle 7: <1, 18, 13, 2, 3>
- Cycle 8: <1, 18, 13, 15, 6>
- Cycle 9: <3, 8, 4, 7, 12>
- Cycle 10: <3, 5, 9, 12, 16>
- Cycle 11: <4, 7, 12, 16, 13>
- Cycle 12: <4, 8, 3, 5, 9>
- Cycle 13: <4, 8, 18, 13, 2>
- Cycle 14: <4, 8, 18, 1, 5>
- Cycle 15: <4, 19, 6, 17, 1>
- Cycle 16: <6, 17, 1, 5, 9>
- Cycle 17: <6, 17, 1, 12, 9>
- Cycle 18: <6, 19, 4, 8, 18>
- Cycle 19: <7, 4, 14, 19, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):

- Cycle 1 has chord <13, 2>
- Cycle 2 has chord <13, 15>
- Cycle 3 has chord <13, 16>
- Cycle 4 has chord <6, 11>
- Cycle 5 has chord <1, 5>
- Cycle 6 has chord <8, 4>
- Cycle 7 has chord <18, 13>
- Cycle 8 has chord <18, 15>
- Cycle 9 has chord <4, 7>
- Cycle 10 has chord <9, 12>
- Cycle 11 has chord <13, 16>
- Cycle 12 has chord <4, 9>
- Cycle 13 has chord <8, 13>
- Cycle 14 has chord <8, 1>
- Cycle 15 has chord <17, 1>
- Cycle 16 has chord <1, 9>
- Cycle 17 has chord <1, 9>
- Cycle 18 has chord <18, 8>
- Cycle 19 has chord <4, 19>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 0 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [0].
