Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.  
- Cycle 1: (18, 22, 18), Cycle 2: (27, 12, 18, 29), Cycle 3: (0, 20, 6, 21), Cycle 4: (17, 15, 1, 27), Cycle 5: (27, 1, 15, 25), Cycle 6: (0, 20, 6, 8), Cycle 7: (17, 15, 25, 8), Cycle 8: (27, 1, 25, 8), Cycle 9: (15, 1, 27, 13), Cycle 10: (4, 29, 18, 23), Cycle 11: (26, 19, 10, 14), Cycle 12: (4, 26, 19, 10), Cycle 13: (5, 21, 0, 3), Cycle 14: (5, 21, 23, 18), Cycle 15: (25, 8, 28, 19), Cycle 16: (25, 8, 6, 14), Cycle 17: (21, 0, 20, 6), Cycle 18: (21, 0, 3, 24), Cycle 19: (1, 27, 23, 18), Cycle 20: (1, 15, 17, 0), Cycle 21: (23, 18, 12, 27), Cycle 22: (23, 4, 29, 18), Cycle 23: (23, 4, 26, 19), Cycle 24: (23, 4, 25, 15), Cycle 25: (9, 24, 3, 0), Cycle 26: (16, 14, 10, 19), Cycle 27: (16, 14, 5, 21)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).  
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <18, (12, 27), 29>  
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (3, 24), 20>  
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <1, (15, 17), 27>  
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <1, (15, 25), 8>  
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, (15, 25), 27>  
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <4, (26, 19), 10>  
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <5, (8, 24), 21>  
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <5, (8, 14), 21>  
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <5, (8, 24), 14>  

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.  
- There are 27 chordless 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [27].
