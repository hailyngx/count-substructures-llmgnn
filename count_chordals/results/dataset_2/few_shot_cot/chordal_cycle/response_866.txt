Response:
After analyzing the graph provided, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is:

<1, (0, 13), 12>

The chordal 4-cycle can be visualized as a rectangle with vertices 1-0-13-12 and the chord connecting non-adjacent vertices 0 and 13, essentially making it a chordal 4-cycle.

Following the steps mentioned earlier, where all the cycles of length 4 or more are examined for exactly one chord, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [1].
