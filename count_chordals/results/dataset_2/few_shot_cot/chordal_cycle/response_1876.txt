Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

Cycles of length 4:
- (0, 5, 7, 3, 0)
- (0, 5, 7, 9, 3, 0)
- (0, 5, 7, 1, 11, 6, 4, 0)
- (0, 10, 11, 6, 4, 0)
- (0, 10, 12, 6, 4, 0)
- (0, 14, 13, 7, 3, 0)
- (4, 6, 11, 3, 4)
- (4, 6, 11, 9, 3, 4)
- (4, 6, 8, 5, 7, 1, 11, 6)
- (4, 6, 8, 5, 7, 9, 3, 4)
- (4, 6, 8, 3, 9, 11, 6)
- (4, 6, 14, 13, 7, 1, 11, 6)
- (4, 6, 14, 13, 0, 5, 7, 1, 11, 6)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 5, 7, 3> (Chord: (0, 3))
- <0, 5, 7, 9> (Chord: (5, 9))
- <0, 5, 8, 6> (Chord: (5, 8))
- <0, 5, 8, 6> (Chord: (0, 6))
- <0, 14, 13, 7> (Chord: (13, 14))
- <4, 6, 8, 3> (Chord: (6, 8))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are [5] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
