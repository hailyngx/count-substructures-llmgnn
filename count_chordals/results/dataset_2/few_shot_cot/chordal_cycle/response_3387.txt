Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle <0, 12, 7, 1>
2. Cycle <0, 12, 3, 6>
3. Cycle <1, 7, 3, 2>
4. Cycle <1, 7, 12, 8>
5. Cycle <2, 5, 13, 9>
6. Cycle <3, 2, 5, 4>
7. Cycle <4, 5, 13, 6>
8. Cycle <6, 10, 4, 5>
9. Cycle <7, 9, 13, 5>
10. Cycle <8, 12, 7, 1>
11. Cycle <9, 13, 0, 12>
12. Cycle <10, 6, 3, 12>
13. Cycle <11, 10, 8, 2>
14. Cycle <12, 0, 13, 5>
15. Cycle <13, 5, 4, 10>

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
1. Chordal 4-cycle <0, 12, 3, 6> with a chord (0, 6)
2. Chordal 4-cycle <3, 2, 5, 4> with a chord (3, 5)
3. Chordal 4-cycle <6, 10, 4, 5> with a chord (6, 5)

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [12].
