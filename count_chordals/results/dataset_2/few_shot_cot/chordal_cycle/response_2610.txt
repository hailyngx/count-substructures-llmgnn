Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: (0, 3, 4, 6, 8)
- Cycle 2: (0, 3, 12, 14, 5)
- Cycle 3: (0, 7, 13, 4, 6)
- Cycle 4: (0, 7, 13, 4, 3)
- Cycle 5: (0, 8, 6, 4, 2)
- Cycle 6: (1, 14, 5, 12, 3)
- Cycle 7: (2, 12, 5, 10, 7)
- Cycle 8: (2, 4, 3, 1, 14)
- Cycle 9: (2, 4, 3, 0, 10)
- Cycle 10: (2, 4, 6, 8, 11)
- Cycle 11: (4, 3, 12, 14, 1)
- Cycle 12: (4, 6, 8, 11, 10)
- Cycle 13: (5, 9, 11, 7, 10)
- Cycle 14: (6, 8, 11, 9, 5)
- Cycle 15: (6, 14, 12, 3, 4)
- Cycle 16: (12, 14, 5, 9, 11)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- <2, 4, 12, 14> has one chord (4, 14). So, the chordal 4-cycle found is <2, 4, 12, 14>.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
- Count = [15].
