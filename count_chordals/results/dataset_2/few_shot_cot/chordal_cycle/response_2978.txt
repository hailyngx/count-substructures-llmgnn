Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <14, (5, 22), 18, 20>.

Let's calculate the number of chordless cycles in this graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 18 - 14 - 5 - 22 - 18
- Cycle 2: 0 - 18 - 22 - 5 - 13 - 5
- Cycle 3: 0 - 18 - 14 - 17 - 11 - 7
- Cycle 4: 0 - 18 - 20 - 21 - 20 - 18
- Cycle 5: 0 - 18 - 14 - 19 - 25 - 0
- Cycle 6: 0 - 10 - 26 - 1 - 12 - 29
- Cycle 7: 0 - 10 - 26 - 7 - 11 - 17
- Cycle 8: 0 - 25 - 19 - 14 - 18 - 0
- Cycle 9: 0 - 25 - 15 - 7 - 26 - 1
- Cycle 10: 0 - 24 - 4 - 16 - 8 - 0
- Cycle 11: 0 - 24 - 9 - 11 - 7 - 26
- Cycle 12: 5 - 14 - 18 - 0 - 8 - 16
- Cycle 13: 5 - 14 - 19 - 25 - 15 - 7
- Cycle 14: 5 - 22 - 4 - 24 - 16 - 8
- Cycle 15: 5 - 22 - 18 - 14 - 19 - 25
- Cycle 16: 7 - 14 - 19 - 25 - 0 - 18
- Cycle 17: 7 - 26 - 10 - 0 - 18 - 3
- Cycle 18: 7 - 26 - 1 - 12 - 25 - 19
- Cycle 19: 11 - 17 - 14 - 18 - 0 - 25
- Cycle 20: 11 - 17 - 14 - 19 - 25 - 15
- Cycle 21: 11 - 7 - 26 - 10 - 0 - 18
- Cycle 22: 11 - 15 - 25 - 19 - 14 - 18
- Cycle 23: 16 - 24 - 9 - 11 - 7 - 15

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has a chord 5-22
- Cycle 2 has no chords
- Cycle 3 has no chords
- Cycle 4 has no chords
- Cycle 5 has no chords
- Cycle 6 has no chords
- Cycle 7 has no chords
- Cycle 8 has no chords
- Cycle 9 has no chords
- Cycle 10 has no chords
- Cycle 11 has no chords
- Cycle 12 has a chord 8-16
- Cycle 13 has no chords
- Cycle 14 has no chords
- Cycle 15 has a chord 14-19
- Cycle 16 has a chord 18-0
- Cycle 17 has a chord 7-26
- Cycle 18 has no chords
- Cycle 19 has no chords
- Cycle 20 has no chords
- Cycle 21 has no chords
- Cycle 22 has no chords
- Cycle 23 has no chords

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
We found 14 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles in the graph is [14].
