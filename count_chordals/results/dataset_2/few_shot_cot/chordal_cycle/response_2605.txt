Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 6) (4, 2) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 6) (3, 5) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 6) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 3, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 3, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 6, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 4, 6, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, 3, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

1. <0, 9, 2, 4>
2. <0, 6, 4, 8>
3. <0, 6, 7, 4>
4. <1, 7, 4, 8>
5. <1, 6, 4, 7>
6. <2, 9, 7, 4>
7. <2, 4, 6, 8>
8. <2, 4, 7, 6>
9. <3, 5, 3, 9>
10. <3, 9, 7, 4>
11. <3, 2, 4, 8>
12. <4, 7, 6, 8>
13. <6, 4, 7, 2>
14. <7, 1, 6, 4>
15. <9, 7, 4, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. <0, 9, 2, 4> - Chord: (2, 4)
2. <0, 6, 4, 8> - Chord: (4, 8)
3. <0, 6, 7, 4> - Chord: (6, 7)
4. <1, 7, 4, 8> - Chord: (7, 8)
5. <1, 6, 4, 7> - Chord: (4, 7)
6. <2, 9, 7, 4> - Chord: (7, 4)
7. <2, 4, 6, 8> - Chord: (4, 8)
8. <2, 4, 7, 6> - Chord: (4, 7)
9. <3, 5, 3, 9> - No chord
10. <3, 9, 7, 4> - Chord: (7, 4)
11. <3, 2, 4, 8> - Chord: (4, 8)
12. <4, 7, 6, 8> - Chord: (6, 8)
13. <6, 4, 7, 2> - Chord: (4, 7)
14. <7, 1, 6, 4> - Chord: (1, 6)
15. <9, 7, 4, 8> - Chord: (7, 8)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is only one chordless cycle: <3, 5, 3, 9>

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [14].
