Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 9, 10, 6>
2. <0, 9, 5, 18>
3. <0, 6, 10, 9>
4. <1, 11, 10, 6>
5. <1, 11, 7, 15>
6. <1, 11, 3, 4>
7. <1, 17, 13, 5>
8. <1, 17, 7, 15>
9. <1, 17, 13, 11> 

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph is: 
<1, 11, 7, 15>, with a chord (11, 7). 

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [8].
