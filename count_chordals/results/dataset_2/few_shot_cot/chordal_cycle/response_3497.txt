Response:
Step 1: 

There are several cycles of length 4:
1. Cycle: {11, 16, 13, 2, 11}
2. Cycle: {11, 16, 6, 5, 11}
3. Cycle: {11, 19, 7, 15, 11}
4. Cycle: {11, 0, 15, 5, 11}
5. Cycle: {16, 13, 2, 8, 14, 5, 16}
6. Cycle: {16, 6, 1, 6}
7. Cycle: {16, 6, 18, 4, 18, 6}
8. Cycle: {6, 9, 17, 12, 3, 19, 7, 15, 0, 2, 13, 16}
9. Cycle: {6, 9, 17, 12, 13, 16, 6}
10. Cycle: {6, 5, 14, 15, 7, 11, 19, 3, 12, 17, 18, 4, 18, 6}
11. Cycle: {9, 17, 18, 6, 1, 6}
12. Cycle: {9, 14, 5, 15, 7, 11, 16, 13, 2, 0, 11}
13. Cycle: {9, 14, 8, 2, 0, 11, 19, 7, 15, 0}
14. Cycle: {8, 14, 5, 6, 1, 6, 16, 13, 2, 8}
15. Cycle: {8, 14, 5, 15, 7, 11, 16, 13, 2, 8}
16. Cycle: {13, 2, 0, 11, 19, 7, 15, 5, 14, 8, 13}

Step 2:

From the list above, the cycle with exactly one chord is:
- Cycle: {6, 9, 17, 12, 3, 19, 7, 15, 0, 2, 13, 16}. The chord is (6, 9).

Step 3:

There is only 1 chordal 4-cycle found, so the count is [1].

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<6, 9, 17, 12>
