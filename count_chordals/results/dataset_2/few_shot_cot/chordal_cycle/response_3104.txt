Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are:

Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
<0, 18, 11, 14>

<1, 11, 18, 0>
<1, 11, 18, 19>
<1, 19, 18, 0>
<1, 19, 18, 11>
<2, 6, 7, 4>
<2, 6, 4, 15>
<2, 6, 13, 8>
<2, 11, 14, 17>
<3, 8, 13, 1>
<3, 8, 13, 6>
<3, 8, 16, 12>
<3, 12, 16, 8>
<3, 12, 9, 2>
<3, 12, 9, 12>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 18, 11, 14> has chord (11, 18)
- <1, 13, 6, 4> has chord (6, 13)
- <1, 11, 14, 17> has chord (11, 14)
- <2, 6, 13, 8> has chord (6, 13)
- <3, 8, 13, 1> has chord (8, 13)
- <4, 6, 13, 1> has chord (6, 13)
- <6, 7, 4, 15> has chord (7, 15)
- <9, 2, 6, 4> has chord (2, 6)
- <11, 14, 17, 3> has chord (14, 3)
- <15, 10, 14, 11> has chord (10, 14)
- <18, 19, 1, 13> has chord (1, 13)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [41]
