Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- <0, 5, 16, 11>
- <0, 5, 13, 8>
- <0, 5, 6, 1>
- <0, 19, 14, 11>
- <1, 6, 5, 13>
- <1, 6, 8, 7>
- <1, 9, 14, 11>
- <1, 9, 18, 10>
- <2, 10, 4, 18>
- <2, 10, 8, 7>
- <3, 16, 5, 12>
- <3, 16, 7, 8>
- <3, 18, 10, 4>
- <4, 10, 8, 13>
- <5, 6, 8, 13>
- <5, 12, 9, 14>
- <7, 8, 13, 5>
- <9, 14, 11, 16>
- <9, 14, 19, 1>
- <10, 18, 9, 14>
- <11, 14, 19, 1>
- <11, 15, 11, 16>
- <11, 16, 7, 8>
- <12, 17, 12, 5>
- <12, 3, 18, 10>
- <12, 5, 16, 11>
- <13, 8, 10, 4>
- <14, 19, 1, 6>
- <16, 11, 14, 19>
- <16, 3, 12, 17>
- <16, 5, 6, 1>
- <16, 7, 8, 13>
- <18, 3, 12, 17>
- <18, 9, 14, 19>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, 5, 16, 11> (chord: (5, 16))
- <0, 5, 13, 8> (chord: (5, 13))
- <1, 6, 5, 13> (chord: (6, 13))
- <1, 9, 14, 11> (chord: (9, 14))
- <1, 9, 18, 10> (chord: (9, 18))
- <3, 16, 7, 8> (chord: (16, 7))
- <5, 12, 9, 14> (chord: (12, 9))
- <7, 8, 13, 5> (chord: (8, 13))
- <9, 14, 11, 16> (chord: (14, 11))
- <12, 5, 16, 11> (chord: (5, 16))

Step 3:
The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [9].
