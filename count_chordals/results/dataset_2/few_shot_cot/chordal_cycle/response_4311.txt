Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 1) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 6) (7, 2) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 1) (8, 3) (6, 5) (6, 7) (6, 1) (6, 3) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 2) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 3, 6, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 0, 3, 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 4, 8, 1> with chord (0, 8)
- <0, 4, 7, 6> with chord (4, 6)
- <0, 4, 7, 3> with chord (4, 3)
- <0, 7, 6, 5> with chord (7, 5)
- <1, 9, 8, 4> with chord (9, 4)
- <1, 9, 8, 3> with chord (9, 3)
- <2, 9, 8, 4> with chord (9, 4)
- <2, 9, 8, 3> with chord (9, 3)
- <3, 7, 6, 5> with chord (7, 5)
- <4, 7, 3, 1> with chord (7, 1)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
<0, 4, 8, 1> - One chord is present (0, 8)
<0, 4, 7, 6> - One chord is present (4, 6)
<0, 4, 7, 3> - One chord is present (4, 3)
<0, 7, 6, 5> - One chord is present (7, 5)
<1, 9, 8, 4> - One chord is present (9, 4)
<1, 9, 8, 3> - One chord is present (9, 3)
<2, 9, 8, 4> - One chord is present (9, 4)
<2, 9, 8, 3> - One chord is present (9, 3)
<3, 7, 6, 5> - One chord is present (7, 5)
<4, 7, 3, 1> - One chord is present (7, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles identified, so the final count is [10].
