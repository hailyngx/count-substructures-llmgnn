Response:
Step 1: 
Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 12, 17, 15, 2, 8, 5, 1, 3>
- Cycle 2: <0, 14, 12, 17, 7, 3, 1, 5>
- Cycle 3: <0, 14, 12, 5, 1, 3, 7>
- Cycle 4: <3, 15, 17, 7, 1, 5>
- Cycle 5: <2, 8, 5, 12, 17, 7, 3>
- Cycle 6: <5, 1, 3, 7, 17, 12, 14>
- Cycle 7: <5, 1, 7, 17, 12, 14, 0>
- Cycle 8: <5, 1, 3, 15, 17, 12, 14>
- Cycle 9: <5, 8, 2, 15, 17, 12, 14>
- Cycle 10: <5, 16, 18, 13, 4>
- Cycle 11: <5, 16, 18, 10, 13>
- Cycle 12: <5, 18, 13, 4, 10>
- Cycle 13: <5, 18, 13, 10, 16>
- Cycle 14: <6, 2, 15, 17, 7, 1>
- Cycle 15: <12, 17, 7, 3, 15, 2>
- Cycle 16: <12, 17, 7, 1, 5, 8>
- Cycle 17: <12, 17, 7, 3, 18, 5>
- Cycle 18: <12, 14, 0, 1, 5, 8>
- Cycle 19: <12, 14, 0, 2, 15, 17>
- Cycle 20: <13, 10, 16, 5, 1>

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 1, 3, (7), 17, 12, 14> (Chord: 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <12, 14, 0, (2), 15, 17> (Chord: 2)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, which is 18.

Therefore, the final count is [18].
