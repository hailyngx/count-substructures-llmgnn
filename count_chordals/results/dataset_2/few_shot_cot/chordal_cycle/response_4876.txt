Response:
Step 1: 
Cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. <11, 16, 4, 22>
2. <11, 16, 4, 10>
3. <11, 18, 1, 25>
4. <11, 18, 20, 9>
5. <11, 24, 15, 19>
6. <16, 4, 22, 17>
7. <16, 4, 10, 23>
8. <18, 1, 25, 5>
9. <18, 1, 9, 6>
10. <18, 20, 9, 6>
11. <22, 4, 10, 23>
12. <22, 4, 11, 16>
13. <2, 27, 9, 6>
14. <2, 27, 9, 20>
15. <2, 23, 14, 5>
16. <2, 23, 10, 4>
17. <2, 10, 4, 16>
18. <29, 14, 5, 25>
19. <29, 14, 7, 3>
20. <26, 22, 17, 4>
21. <26, 22, 4, 10>
22. <28, 13, 19, 15>
23. <1, 25, 5, 14>
24. <1, 25, 13, 19>
25. <17, 22, 26, 12>
26. <5, 25, 13, 28>

Step 2:
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord:
1. <11, 16, 4, 22> (11, 4) is the chord
2. <11, 18, 1, 25> (18, 1) is the chord
3. <16, 4, 22, 17> (16, 22) is the chord
4. <18, 1, 25, 5> (1, 25) is the chord
5. <2, 27, 9, 6> (27, 9) is the chord
6. <2, 23, 14, 5> (23, 14) is the chord
7. <29, 14, 5, 25> (14, 5) is the chord
8. <26, 22, 17, 4> (22, 17) is the chord

Step 3:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final count is [8].
