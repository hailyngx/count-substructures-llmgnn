Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- <5, 1, 3, 6, 5>
- <5, 1, 7, 13, 8, 2, 6, 5>
- <5, 1, 7, 0, 4, 11, 13, 8, 2, 6, 5>
- <5, 1, 7, 0, 9, 14, 12, 11, 4, 0, 8, 13, 6, 2, 1, 5>
- <9, 4, 0, 7, 1, 3, 6, 5, 11, 13, 8, 2, 9>
- <9, 4, 0, 8, 13, 11, 5, 6, 3, 1, 7, 9>
- <9, 4, 0, 8, 2, 6, 5, 11, 13, 1, 7, 9>
- <9, 4, 11, 5, 6, 13, 8, 0, 7, 1, 9>
- <9, 2, 6, 5, 11, 13, 8, 0, 7, 1, 3, 9>
- <9, 2, 8, 13, 11, 5, 6, 3, 1, 7, 0, 4, 9>
- <9, 2, 8, 0, 7, 1, 3, 6, 5, 11, 13, 9>
- <9, 10, 14, 12, 11, 4, 0, 7, 1, 13, 8, 2, 6, 9>

Step 2:
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- [2] - <5, 1, 7, 13, 8, 2, 6, 5>
- [2] - <5, 1, 7, 0, 4, 11, 13, 8, 2, 6, 5>
- [2] - <9, 4, 0, 7, 1, 3, 6, 5, 11, 13, 8, 2, 9>
- [2] - <9, 4, 11, 5, 6, 13, 8, 0, 7, 1, 9>

Step 3: 
Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [4]
