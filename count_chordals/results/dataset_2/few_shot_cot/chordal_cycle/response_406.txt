Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 5, 10>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 9, 14>
- Cycle 3: <0, 7, 12, 6>
- Cycle 4: <1, 2, 8, 4>
- Cycle 5: <1, 2, 8, 14>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 6, 3>
- Cycle 7: <1, 5, 10, 8>
- Cycle 8: <1, 5, 10, 2>
- Cycle 9: <1, 11, 3, 6>
- Cycle 10: <1, 11, 8, 4>
- Cycle 11: <1, 11, 8, 14>
- Cycle 12: <1, 11, 0, 7>
- Cycle 13: <1, 11, 0, 13>
- Cycle 14: <2, 8, 4, 13>
- Cycle 15: <2, 8, 14, 13>
- Cycle 16: <2, 8, 14, 12>
- Cycle 17: <2, 8, 10, 5>
- Cycle 18: <2, 8, 10, 3>
- Cycle 19: <2, 11, 3, 6>
- Cycle 20: <2, 11, 1, 9>
- Cycle 21: <5, 6, 3, 11>
- Cycle 22: <5, 6, 9, 14>
- Cycle 23: <5, 10, 8, 14>
- Cycle 24: <5, 10, 2, 8>
- Cycle 25: <5, 10, 1, 9>
- Cycle 26: <3, 6, 9, 14>
- Cycle 27: <3, 10, 8, 14>
- Cycle 28: <3, 11, 1, 9>
- Cycle 29: <3, 11, 0, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The unique chordal 4-cycle is <1, 2, 8, 4>
- The unique chordal 4-cycle is <1, 2, 8, 14>
- The unique chordal 4-cycle is <1, 5, 10, 2>
- The unique chordal 4-cycle is <2, 11, 1, 9>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
