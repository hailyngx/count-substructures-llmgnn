Response:
To count the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph, we will follow the steps provided.

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:

1. Cycle <5, 12, 7, 4>
2. Cycle <2, 9, 13, 4>
3. Cycle <3, 14, 8, 11>
4. Cycle <3, 14, 8, 6>
5. Cycle <1, 11, 12, 7>
6. Cycle <1, 11, 18, 10>
7. Cycle <1, 17, 13, 4>
8. Cycle <1, 17, 10, 19>
9. Cycle <1, 18, 3, 5>
10. Cycle <1, 18, 10, 19>
11. Cycle <1, 18, 3, 14>
12. Cycle <10, 19, 6, 8>
13. Cycle <17, 13, 4, 9>
14. Cycle <17, 10, 18, 11>
15. Cycle <17, 1, 11, 12>
16. Cycle <12, 0, 8, 14>
17. Cycle <12, 0, 8, 6>
18. Cycle <12, 7, 6, 19>
19. Cycle <6, 19, 10, 17>
20. Cycle <6, 19, 3, 18>
21. Cycle <7, 13, 9, 2>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycle in the graph is:
<1, (17, 13), 4>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [20].
