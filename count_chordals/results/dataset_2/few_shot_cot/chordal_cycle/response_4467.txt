Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 0) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 9) (7, 3) (7, 8) (7, 1) (2, 5) (2, 8) (2, 6) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 6) (8, 3) (8, 1) (0, 5) (0, 4) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 6) (6, 4) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 1) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 8, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 8, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 0, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 2, 6, 3, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 9, 5> with edges (0, 5), (5, 9), (9, 4), (4, 0)
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 9, 7> with edges (1, 5), (5, 9), (9, 7), (7, 1)
- Cycle 3: <1, 5, 8, 2> with edges (1, 5), (5, 8), (8, 2), (2, 1)
- Cycle 4: <1, 6, 4, 9> with edges (1, 9), (9, 4), (4, 6), (6, 1)
- Cycle 5: <1, 6, 2, 8> with edges (1, 6), (6, 2), (2, 8), (8, 1)
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 9, 5> with edges (1, 5), (5, 9), (9, 7), (7, 1)
- Cycle 7: <1, 8, 2, 6> with edges (1, 6), (6, 2), (2, 8), (8, 1)
- Cycle 8: <1, 8, 3, 7> with edges (1, 7), (7, 3), (3, 8), (8, 1)
- Cycle 9: <2, 5, 9, 7> with edges (2, 5), (5, 9), (9, 7), (7, 2)
- Cycle 10: <2, 8, 3, 7> with edges (2, 8), (8, 3), (3, 7), (7, 2)
- Cycle 11: <3, 4, 9, 5> with edges (3, 4), (4, 9), (9, 5), (5, 3)
- Cycle 12: <3, 7, 1, 6> with edges (3, 7), (7, 1), (1, 6), (6, 3)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- The cycle <1, 6, 2, 8> has exactly one chord (6, 8).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 11 - 1 = 10.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
