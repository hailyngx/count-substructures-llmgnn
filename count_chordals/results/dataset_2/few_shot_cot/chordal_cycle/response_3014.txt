Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 4, 15, 18, 12>
- <0, 4, 15, 16, 14>
- <0, 4, 11, 14, 17>
- <0, 4, 7, 5, 17>
- <1, 7, 5, 17, 14>
- <1, 7, 4, 0, 16>
- <1, 7, 8, 9, 6>
- <2, 4, 7, 5, 17>
- <3, 11, 4, 15, 18>
- <3, 11, 4, 7, 8>
- <3, 11, 13, 2, 1>
- <3, 11, 13, 2, 4>
- <4, 7, 8, 9, 6>
- <4, 11, 14, 17, 5>
- <5, 7, 8, 9, 6>
- <6, 12, 9, 8, 7>
- <6, 19, 3, 11, 13>
- <7, 8, 9, 12, 18>
- <10, 17, 14, 16, 15>

Step 2: 
Chordal 4-cycles:
- <0, 4, 15, 18, 12> (Chord: (4, 15))
- <0, 4, 15, 16, 14> (Chord: (14, 16))
- <1, 7, 8, 9, 6> (Chord: (7, 9))
- <2, 4, 7, 5, 17> (Chord: (4, 5))
- <3, 11, 13, 2, 1> (Chord: (13, 2))
- <6, 12, 9, 8, 7> (Chord: (12, 9))
- <6, 19, 3, 11, 13> (Chord: (3, 11))
- <10, 17, 14, 16, 15> (Chord: (15, 16))

Step 3:
Count of chordless 4-cycles: [1]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found inside <> each only once are:
<0, 4, 15, 18, 12>
<0, 4, 15, 16, 14>
<1, 7, 8, 9, 6>
<2, 4, 7, 5, 17>
<3, 11, 13, 2, 1>
<6, 12, 9, 8, 7>
<6, 19, 3, 11, 13>
<10, 17, 14, 16, 15>
