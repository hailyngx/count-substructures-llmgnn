Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 5) (7, 1) (7, 8) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (6, 3) (6, 9) (6, 5) (9, 3) (9, 6) (8, 4) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 2) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 1) (2, 5) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 5
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 1, 0, 6, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 6, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 9, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 3, 5, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 3, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 7, 1, 4, 2, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 6, 5, 2, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 7, 4, 8, 5, 6>
- Cycle 4: <2, 4, 1, 3, 6, 9>
- Cycle 5: <3, 0, 7, 5, 8, 4>

Step 2:
- Checking for chords in each cycle:
    - Cycle 1 has chord (1, 2)
    - Cycle 2 is chordal as it has a chord (0, 5)
    - Cycle 3 has chord (1, 5)
    - Cycle 4 is chordal as it has a chord (1, 3)
    - Cycle 5 has chord (0, 7)

Step 3:
There are 2 unique chordal 4-cycles found: <0, 3, 6, 5, 2, 1> and <2, 4, 1, 3, 6, 9>. 
Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [3].
