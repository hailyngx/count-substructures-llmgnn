Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with all existing edges:
- <5, 0, 13, 7, 4>
- <5, 0, 13, 7, 17>
- <5, 0, 10, 18, 8>
- <5, 0, 13, 7, 19>
- <3, 5, 0, 13, 7>
- <3, 5, 0, 10, 18>
- <3, 5, 0, 13, 7>
- <3, 10, 18, 8, 13>
- <15, 5, 0, 13, 7>
- <15, 16, 1, 17, 7>
- <4, 7, 17, 2, 4>
- <7, 19, 14, 3, 5>
- <7, 19, 14, 16, 6>
- <7, 4, 11, 4>
- <8, 13, 16, 1, 17>
- <8, 18, 10, 9, 0>
- <13, 16, 1, 17, 7>
- <10, 9, 0, 13, 7>
- <10, 9, 0, 13, 16>
- <17, 7, 19, 14, 3>
- <17, 2, 4, 11, 4>
- <1, 17, 7, 4, 11>
- <18, 8, 13, 0, 5>
- <19, 14, 3, 5, 0>
- <0, 13, 16, 1, 17>
- <14, 3, 5, 0, 9>
- <6, 1, 17, 7, 4>
- <2, 4, 7, 13, 8>
- <16, 15, 5, 0, 9>
- <12, 1, 17, 7, 4>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <5, 0, 13, 7, 4> has a chord 13-7
- <5, 0, 10, 18, 8> has a chord 10-18
- <3, 5, 0, 13, 7> has a chord 5-13
- <15, 16, 1, 17, 7> has a chord 1-17
- <4, 7, 17, 2, 4> has a chord 7-17
- <8, 13, 16, 1, 17> has a chord 16-1
- <13, 16, 1, 17, 7> has a chord 1-17
- <10, 9, 0, 13, 7> has a chord 9-13
- <17, 2, 4, 11, 4> has a chord 2-11

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles, so the final count is [8].
