Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 2, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 8, 12, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 9, 4, 6, 12, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 13, 0, 8, 12, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 8, 12, 6, 2>
- Cycle 6: <3, 2, 8, 7, 3>
- Cycle 7: <3, 2, 10, 13, 1, 12, 3>
- Cycle 8: <4, 5, 14, 3, 6, 4>
- Cycle 9: <4, 9, 1, 13, 10, 4>
- Cycle 10: <5, 14, 3, 2, 10, 5>
- Cycle 11: <6, 0, 4, 9, 10, 6>
- Cycle 12: <7, 8, 0, 13, 1, 7>
- Cycle 13: <7, 13, 10, 12, 6, 7>
- Cycle 14: <8, 2, 10, 13, 7, 8>
- Cycle 15: <9, 4, 6, 12, 10, 9>
- Cycle 16: <10, 2, 8, 0, 13, 10>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- <1, 9, 4, 6, 12, 1> has one chord (6, 12)
- <1, 13, 0, 8, 12, 1> has one chord (0, 8)
- <3, 2, 10, 13, 1, 12, 3> has one chord (10, 13)

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: [3]

Unique chordal 4-cycles:
- <1, 9, 4, 6, 12, 1>
- <1, 13, 0, 8, 12, 1>
- <3, 2, 10, 13, 1, 12, 3>
