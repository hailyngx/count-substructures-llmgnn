Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

1. <0, 4, 18, 14, 21> - Chord: (4, 14)
2. <1, 17, 13, 9, 5> - Chord: (13, 9)
3. <1, 17, 23, 25, 2> - Chord: (17, 25)
4. <2, 6, 10, 7, 21> - Chord: (6, 7)
5. <4, 8, 25, 2, 6> - Chord: (8, 2)
6. <5, 9, 28, 19, 7> - Chord: (9, 19)
7. <10, 17, 1, 24, 26> - Chord: (17, 24)
8. <11, 7, 21, 14, 18> - Chord: (7, 14)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [21]
