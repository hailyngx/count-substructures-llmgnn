Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 4) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 6) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 1) (6, 9) (6, 4) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 0) (1, 9) (1, 7) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (2, 6) (2, 1) (8, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 6) (0, 3) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 6, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 0, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 2, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 5, 3, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 4, 9, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 4, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 6, 2, 1, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 4, 9, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 7, 0, 8, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 9, 6, 3, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 9, 5, 4, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 9, 4, 7, 1>
- Cycle 11: <2, 6, 0, 8, 2>
- Cycle 12: <3, 5, 9, 6, 3>
- Cycle 13: <3, 5, 4, 0, 3>
- Cycle 14: <3, 6, 9, 5, 3>
- Cycle 15: <3, 6, 2, 1, 3>
- Cycle 16: <4, 5, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle 17: <4, 7, 0, 8, 4>
- Cycle 18: <4, 9, 5, 3, 4>
- Cycle 19: <5, 9, 4, 7, 5>
- Cycle 20: <6, 9, 4, 7, 6>
- Cycle 21: <6, 9, 5, 3, 6>
- Cycle 22: <7, 4, 5, 9, 7>
- Cycle 23: <8, 0, 4, 9, 8>
- Cycle 24: <8, 0, 6, 2, 8>
- Cycle 25: <8, 1, 9, 6, 8>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, (2, 4), 5)> - Chord: (2, 4)
- <1, (0, 8), 7)> - Chord: (0, 8)
- <1, (3, 5), 6)> - Chord: (3, 5)
- <1, (5, 9), 4)> - Chord: (5, 9)
- <6, (4, 7), 9)> - Chord: (4, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There are 20 chordless 4-cycles in this graph.
Therefore, the final number inside brackets is [20].
