Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
1. Cycle <0, 8, 15, 19, 9>
2. Cycle <1, 5, 6, 14, 4>
3. Cycle <1, 5, 17, 18, 13>
4. Cycle <1, 2, 12, 3, 13>
5. Cycle <1, 2, 10, 4, 14>
6. Cycle <3, 7, 14, 6, 1>
7. Cycle <3, 7, 15, 19, 13>
8. Cycle <3, 12, 2, 10, 4>
9. Cycle <3, 12, 16, 13, 18>
10. Cycle <4, 8, 0, 9, 19>
11. Cycle <4, 14, 6, 5, 1>
12. Cycle <7, 3, 12, 2, 1>

19. Cycle <16, 17, 18, 13, 3>
20. Cycle <19, 9, 0, 8, 15>

Step 2: Checking for chordal cycles:
- Checking cycle 1: <0, 8, 15, 19, 9> does not have a chord.
- Checking cycle 2: <1, 5, 6, 14, 4> has a chord <1, 6>.
- Checking cycle 3: <1, 5, 17, 18, 13> has a chord <1, 17>.
- Checking cycle 4: <1, 2, 12, 3, 13> does not have a chord.
- Checking cycle 5: <1, 2, 10, 4, 14> has a chord <1, 4>.
- Checking cycle 6: <3, 7, 14, 6, 1> has a chord <3, 6>.
- Checking cycle 7: <3, 7, 15, 19, 13> has a chord <3, 19>.
- Checking cycle 8: <3, 12, 2, 10, 4> has a chord <3, 10>.
- Checking cycle 9: <3, 12, 16, 13, 18> has a chord <3, 16>.
- Checking cycle 10: <4, 8, 0, 9, 19> does not have a chord.
- Checking cycle 11: <4, 14, 6, 5, 1> has a chord <4, 5>.
- Checking cycle 12: <7, 3, 12, 2, 1> has a chord <7, 2>.
- Checking cycle 13: <13, 4, 14, 7, 3> has a chord <13, 7>.
- Checking cycle 14: <13, 18, 17, 5, 1> has a chord <13, 5>.
- Checking cycle 15: <13, 18, 3, 12, 2> has a chord <13, 12>.
- Checking cycle 16: <15, 8, 4, 14, 6> has a chord <15, 14>.
- Checking cycle 17: <15, 8, 0, 9, 19> does not have a chord.
- Checking cycle 18: <15, 16, 17, 5, 1> has a chord <15, 17>.
- Checking cycle 19: <16, 17, 18, 13, 3> has a chord <16, 18>.
- Checking cycle 20: <19, 9, 0, 8, 15> does not have a chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- Number of chordless cycles = 6

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [6].
