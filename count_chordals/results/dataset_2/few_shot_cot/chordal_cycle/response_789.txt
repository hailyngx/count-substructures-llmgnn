Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle <0, 5, 4, 9>
- Cycle <0, 5, 4, 12>
- Cycle <0, 5, 7, 11>
- Cycle <0, 13, 7, 11>
- Cycle <1, 4, 5, 0>
- Cycle <1, 4, 9, 6>
- Cycle <1, 6, 9, 8>
- Cycle <1, 6, 10, 7>
- Cycle <2, 4, 9, 6>
- Cycle <2, 4, 12, 9>
- Cycle <2, 6, 9, 8>
- Cycle <2, 6, 10, 7>
- Cycle <3, 8, 9, 6>
- Cycle <3, 8, 14, 0>
- Cycle <3, 10, 6, 9>
- Cycle <3, 10, 13, 7>
- Cycle <4, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle <4, 9, 8, 14>
- Cycle <4, 12, 9, 8>
- Cycle <5, 0, 13, 7>
- Cycle <5, 0, 14, 1>
- Cycle <5, 4, 12, 9>
- Cycle <6, 9, 8, 14>
- Cycle <6, 10, 7, 11>
- Cycle <7, 11, 6, 9>
- Cycle <8, 9, 4, 12>
- Cycle <8, 14, 1, 6>
- Cycle <10, 6, 1, 14>
- Cycle <11, 7, 13, 3>
- Cycle <12, 9, 4, 1>
  
Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles identified are:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (8, 14), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (6, 9), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <3, (8, 9), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (9, 12), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (0, 14), 1>

Step 3:
The total number of chordless cycles found is [8].
