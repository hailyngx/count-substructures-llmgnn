Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 7) (9, 8) (9, 3) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 7) (0, 3) (7, 5) (7, 8) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (1, 5) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 2) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 7) (3, 2) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 7, and node 3
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, and node 2
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 7, 1, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 0, 7, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 8, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 1, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 8, 0, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
  - (0, 4, 1, 5)
  - (0, 4, 8, 7)
  - (0, 6, 2, 5)
  - (1, 4, 8, 7)
  - (1, 4, 0, 6)
  - (1, 5, 6, 2)
  
Step 2:
- The cycles that have exactly one chord are:
  - <0, (4, 1), 5>
  - <0, (4, 8), 7>
  - <0, (6, 2), 5>
  - <1, (4, 8), 7>
  - <1, (4, 0), 6>
  - <1, (5, 6), 2>

Step 3:
- There are 6 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordless cycles is [6].
