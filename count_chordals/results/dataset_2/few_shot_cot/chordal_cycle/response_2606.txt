Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <0, 11, 16, 1>
2. <0, 11, 15, 2>
3. <0, 10, 7, 3>
4. <0, 10, 2, 5>
5. <0, 10, 7, 6>
6. <1, 16, 6, 7>
7. <1, 4, 17, 9>
8. <1, 4, 13, 8>
9. <2, 15, 3, 7>
10. <2, 15, 9, 17>
11. <2, 5, 14, 19>
12. <3, 15, 9, 17>
13. <3, 15, 1, 4>
14. <4, 13, 8, 18>
15. <4, 13, 19, 12>
16. <4, 17, 9, 15>
17. <5, 13, 8, 18>
18. <5, 14, 19, 12>
19. <6, 16, 1, 4>
20. <6, 7, 10, 2>
21. <6, 7, 3, 15>
22. <7, 10, 2, 5>
23. <8, 13, 19, 14>
24. <9, 15, 11, 16>
25. <9, 17, 4, 13>
26. <12, 19, 14, 18>
27. <13, 19, 12, 6>
28. <14, 19, 13, 5>
29. <15, 11, 16, 6>
30. <15, 2, 5, 14>
31. <17, 3, 15, 9>
32. <17, 4, 13, 8>
33. <18, 8, 13, 19>

Step 2:
- The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <1, (4, 17), 9>
2. <1, (4, 13), 8>
3. <1, (6, 16), 7>
4. <6, (1, 4), 16>
5. <3, (7, 10), 2>
6. <2, (5, 14), 15>
7. <4, (8, 18), 13>
8. <5, (13, 19), 14>
9. <9, (15, 11), 17>
10. <13, (8, 18), 19>

Step 3:
- The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [23].
