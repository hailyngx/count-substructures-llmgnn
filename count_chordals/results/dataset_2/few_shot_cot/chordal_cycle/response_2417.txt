Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (6, 0) (9, 4) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 2) (9, 0) (2, 9) (2, 8) (2, 3) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 2) (8, 1) (0, 6) (0, 9) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 1) (1, 4) (1, 6) (1, 8) (1, 0) (1, 5) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 2) (3, 0) (5, 7) (5, 0) (5, 1) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 9, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 7, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 9, 1, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 0, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 8, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 2, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 6, 8, 2, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 5, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 6, 1, 4, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 1, 4, 7, 3, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 6, 1, 8, 9, 4, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 9, 4, 7, 5, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 4, 7, 5, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

From the cycles listed above, we find that only Cycle 1: <0, 6, 1, 5, 0> has exactly one chord, which is (6, 5).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

Since only Cycle 1 has exactly one chord, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [<1>].
