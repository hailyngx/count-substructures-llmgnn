Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (1, 5) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 4) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 4) (2, 5) (2, 1) (2, 6) (8, 1) (8, 0) (8, 7) (8, 6) (0, 5) (0, 8) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 8) (6, 7) (6, 4) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 3) (4, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 3, 2, 4, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 1, 6, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 1, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 1, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 3, 2, 8, 7, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 8, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 1, 0, 7, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: <5, 1, 4, 9, 5>
- Cycle 2: <5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 5>
- Cycle 3: <5, 1, 2, 6, 3, 5>
- Cycle 4: <5, 4, 6, 3, 5>
- Cycle 5: <5, 0, 8, 6, 7, 9, 5>
- Cycle 6: <1, 3, 6, 4, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 4, 6, 3, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 2, 6, 3, 1>

Step 2: 
Chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord: 
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <5, 1, 4, 9, 5> (Chord: (1, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 5> (Chord: (3, 2))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <5, 1, 2, 6, 3, 5> (Chord: (1, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, 4, 6, 3, 5> (Chord: (4, 3))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, 0, 8, 6, 7, 9, 5> (Chord: (0, 7))

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
