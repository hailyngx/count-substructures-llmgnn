Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 12, 6, 9, 13, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 8, 14, 7, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 9, 6, 12, 0, 14, 1, 2>
- Cycle 5: <3, 9, 13, 7, 1, 4, 5, 11, 3>
- Cycle 6: <4, 5, 8, 14, 0, 12, 2, 1, 4>
- Cycle 7: <5, 11, 6, 8, 4, 1, 0, 12, 10, 2, 3, 13, 7, 5>
- Cycle 8: <6, 8, 4, 1, 7, 13, 9, 2, 12, 6>
- Cycle 9: <9, 2, 12, 6, 8, 14, 7, 13, 3, 9>
- Cycle 10: <10, 2, 9, 6, 12, 0, 14, 7, 13, 11, 5, 8, 10>

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 14, 7, 1, 0> (Chord: (1, 7))
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, 9, 6, 12, 0, 14, 1, 2> (Chord: (2, 1))
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <4, 5, 8, 14, 0, 12, 2, 1, 4> (Chord: (4, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <5, 11, 6, 8, 4, 1, 0, 12, 10, 2, 3, 13, 7, 5> (Chord: (5, 8))
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <6, 8, 4, 1, 7, 13, 9, 2, 12, 6> (Chord: (6, 9))
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <9, 2, 12, 6, 8, 14, 7, 13, 3, 9> (Chord: (9, 3))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are [6] unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
