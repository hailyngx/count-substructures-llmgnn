Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle <5, 7, 11, 9>
- Cycle <5, 7, 3, 6>
- Cycle <5, 7, 11, 14>
- Cycle <5, 13, 6, 7>
- Cycle <5, 13, 10, 14>
- Cycle <5, 11, 8, 9>
- Cycle <5, 11, 14, 10>
- Cycle <5, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle <5, 9, 11, 7>
- Cycle <7, 11, 14, 10>
- Cycle <7, 11, 9, 5>
- Cycle <7, 11, 8, 9>
- Cycle <7, 13, 10, 14>
- Cycle <7, 13, 6, 5>
- Cycle <7, 13, 10, 4>
- Cycle <11, 9, 8, 12>
- Cycle <11, 9, 14, 10>
- Cycle <11, 14, 10, 13>
- Cycle <13, 10, 14, 11>

- Cycle <13, 10, 1, 3>
- Cycle <13, 6, 7, 3>
- Cycle <13, 6, 12, 2>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Chordal 4-cycle <5, 7, 11, 9> with chord (5, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle <7, 11, 14, 10> with chord (7, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle <11, 9, 8, 12> with chord (9, 12)
- Chordal 4-cycle <13, 10, 4, 2> with chord (10, 4)

Step 3:
There are a total of [4] chordal 4-cycles found.
