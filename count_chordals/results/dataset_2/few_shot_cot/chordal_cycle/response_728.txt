Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (5, 23, 22, 4) is a cycle of length 4.
- (5, 24, 21, 23) is a cycle of length 4.
- (7, 3, 26, 2) is a cycle of length 4.
- (7, 3, 10, 24) is a cycle of length 4.
- (9, 6, 17, 11) is a cycle of length 4.
- (13, 11, 7, 3) is a cycle of length 4.
- (19, 14, 8, 3) is a cycle of length 4.
- (15, 25, 22, 4) is a cycle of length 4.
- (15, 25, 6, 17) is a cycle of length 4.
- (15, 25, 2, 4) is a cycle of length 4.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- (5, 23, 22, 4) has a chord 23-4.
- (5, 24, 21, 23) has a chord 24-21.
- (7, 3, 26, 2) has a chord 3-2.
- (7, 3, 10, 24) has a chord 3-10.
- (9, 6, 17, 11) has a chord 6-11.
- (13, 11, 7, 3) has a chord 11-7.
- (19, 14, 8, 3) has a chord 14-8.
- (15, 25, 22, 4) has a chord 25-22.
- (15, 25, 6, 17) has a chord 25-6.
- (15, 25, 2, 4) has a chord 2-4.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [10].
Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <5, 23, 22, 4>
- <5, 24, 21, 23>
- <7, 3, 26, 2>
- <7, 3, 10, 24>
- <9, 6, 17, 11>
- <13, 11, 7, 3>
- <19, 14, 8, 3>
- <15, 25, 22, 4>
- <15, 25, 6, 17>
- <15, 25, 2, 4>
