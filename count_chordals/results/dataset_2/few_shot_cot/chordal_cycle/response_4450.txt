Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 2) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 7) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 3) (4, 2) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 3) (2, 6) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 7) (3, 8) (3, 0) (3, 5) (5, 7) (5, 3) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, 8, 0, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 3, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 7, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 2, 0, and node 3
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 2, 3, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <6, 2, 8, 0, 6>
- Cycle 2: <2, 8, 0, 3, 2>
- Cycle 3: <0, 3, 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle 4: <3, 0, 8, 4, 3>
- Cycle 5: <4, 8, 2, 6, 4>
- Cycle 6: <8, 2, 6, 9, 8>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 9, 7, 2>
- Cycle 8: <6, 9, 7, 4, 6>
- Cycle 9: <9, 7, 4, 3, 9>
- Cycle 10: <7, 4, 3, 5, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has chord <2, 8>
- Cycle 2 has chord <8, 0>
- Cycle 3 has chord <3, 4>
- Cycle 4 has chord <4, 8>
- Cycle 5 has chord <8, 2>
- Cycle 6 has chord <6, 9>
- Cycle 7 has chord <6, 9>
- Cycle 8 has chord <9, 7>
- Cycle 9 has chord <7, 4>
- Cycle 10 has chord <4, 3>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles:
In this graph, there are 10 cycles with exactly one chord. So, the number of chordal 4-cycles is [0].
