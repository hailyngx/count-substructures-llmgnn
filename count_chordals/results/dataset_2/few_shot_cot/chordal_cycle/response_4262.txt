Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- First, let's list all 4-cycles in the graph:
   1. <4, 1, 11, 3>
   2. <4, 3, 16, 18>
   3. <4, 18, 6, 19>
   4. <4, 9, 17, 18>
   5. <4, 13, 12, 18>
   6. <1, 11, 7, 19>
   7. <1, 9, 17, 18>
   8. <1, 7, 19, 5>
   9. <11, 3, 16, 18>
   10. <11, 15, 5, 19>
   11. <3, 16, 18, 6>
   12. <3, 9, 17, 18>
   13. <4, 1, 7, 19>
   14. <4, 9, 0, 12>
   15. <4, 13, 12, 0>
   16. <7, 11, 3, 4>
   17. <7, 1, 9, 4>
   18. <7, 19, 5, 15>
   19. <19, 7, 1, 4>
   20. <19, 5, 15, 11>
   21. <16, 18, 6, 10>
   22. <18, 6, 19, 7>
   23. <18, 17, 9, 4>
   24. <18, 16, 3, 11>
   25. <9, 17, 18, 4>
   26. <9, 1, 4, 13>
   27. <9, 0, 12, 14>
   28. <12, 0, 9, 4>
   29. <12, 13, 4, 1>
   30. <14, 12, 13, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Out of the cycles listed, only one cycle has exactly one chord:
  <4, 1, 11, 3> with the chord (1, 3)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is the number of cycles listed in Step 1 excluding the cycle with a chord.
- There are 29 chordless cycles found in the graph.

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [29].
