Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 4) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 2) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 2) (7, 1) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 3) (3, 9) (3, 1) (3, 6) (3, 8) (6, 5) (6, 9) (6, 3) (6, 2) (6, 0) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 6) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 6) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 7, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 1, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 8, 2, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 2, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 5, 4, 8, 3, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <1, 9, 4, 5, 7, 2, 6, 3, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 9, 4, 8, 3, 6, 2, 7, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 9, 3, 6, 2, 4, 5, 7, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 9, 5, 4, 2, 6, 3, 1>
- Cycle 6: <4, 5, 9, 6, 2, 7, 1, 4>
- Cycle 7: <4, 5, 7, 2, 6, 9, 1, 4>
- Cycle 8: <4, 9, 5, 7, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4>
- Cycle 9: <5, 9, 1, 7, 2, 6, 3, 8, 5>
- Cycle 10: <9, 1, 7, 2, 6, 5, 4, 8, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).

The chordal 4-cycle found is:
<1, (4, 7), 2>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

As there was only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count is [0].
