Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- 4-cycle: <2, 1, 0, 3>
- 4-cycle: <2, 1, 6, 8>
- 4-cycle: <2, 1, 7, 10>
- 4-cycle: <2, 1, 7, 9>
- 4-cycle: <2, 1, 4, 17>
- 4-cycle: <2, 6, 8, 19>
- 4-cycle: <2, 6, 19, 18>
- 4-cycle: <2, 6, 16, 8>
- 4-cycle: <2, 7, 10, 5>
- 4-cycle: <2, 7, 9, 11>
- 4-cycle: <2, 7, 9, 18>
- 4-cycle: <2, 4, 17, 15>
- 4-cycle: <8, 6, 16, 17>
- 4-cycle: <8, 15, 14, 3>
- 4-cycle: <8, 15, 17, 5>
- 4-cycle: <8, 15, 17, 4>
- 4-cycle: <8, 19, 18, 13>
- 4-cycle: <8, 19, 18, 9>
- 4-cycle: <8, 19, 6, 2>
- 4-cycle: <3, 0, 13, 5>
- 4-cycle: <3, 0, 13, 17>
- 4-cycle: <3, 11, 9, 18>
- 4-cycle: <11, 9, 18, 19>
- 4-cycle: <5, 10, 7, 2>
- 4-cycle: <5, 13, 18, 9>
- 4-cycle: <13, 18, 9, 7>
- 4-cycle: <13, 18, 9, 11>
- 4-cycle: <15, 14, 3, 0>
- 4-cycle: <15, 17, 16, 6>
- 4-cycle: <17, 16, 6, 2>

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only the 4-cycle <2, 6, 8, 19> has exactly one chord, which is the edge (6, 8).

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
- As there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the count is [1].

Therefore, there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph: <2, 6, 8, 19>.
