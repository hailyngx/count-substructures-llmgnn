Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <0, 1, 13, 8, 4> with chord (1, 8, 13)
- <10, 0, 13, 1, 9> with chord (0, 13, 9)
- <2, 12, 5, 1, 9> with chord (5, 1, 9)
- <3, 2, 7, 11, 6> with chord (7, 11, 6)
- <4, 8, 10, 0, 9> with chord (10, 0, 9)
- <5, 12, 2, 7, 11> with chord (2, 7, 11)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <0, 1, 13, 8> has one chord (1, 8) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <1, 13, 8, 4> has one chord (8, 13) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <13, 8, 4, 0> has one chord (0, 13) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <8, 4, 0, 1> has one chord (4, 8) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <4, 0, 1, 13> has one chord (1, 4) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <0, 1, 13, 8> has one chord (0, 13) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <1, 13, 8, 4> has one chord (8, 13) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <13, 8, 4, 0> has one chord (4, 13) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <8, 4, 0, 10> has one chord (4, 8) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <4, 0, 10, 13> has one chord (0, 10) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <0, 10, 13, 1> has one chord (10, 13) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <10, 13, 1, 9> has one chord (1, 10) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <13, 1, 9, 0> has one chord (9, 13) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <1, 9, 0, 10> has one chord (0, 9) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <9, 0, 10, 13> has one chord (10, 9) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <0, 10, 13, 8> has one chord (8, 10) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <10, 13, 8, 4> has one chord (8, 13) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <13, 8, 4, 0> has one chord (4, 8) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <8, 4, 0, 3> has one chord (0, 4) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <4, 0, 3, 13> has one chord (3, 4) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <0, 3, 13, 6> has one chord (3, 0) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <3, 13, 6, 11> has one chord (6, 3) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <13, 6, 11, 4> has one chord (11, 13) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <6, 11, 4, 8> has one chord (11, 6) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <11, 4, 8, 10> has one chord (8, 11) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <4, 8, 10, 0> has one chord (10, 8) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <8, 10, 0, 13> has one chord (13, 8) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <10, 0, 13, 1> has one chord (0, 13) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <0, 13, 1, 9> has one chord (1, 13) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <13, 1, 9, 11> has one chord (9, 13) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <1, 9, 11, 7> has one chord (7, 9) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <9, 11, 7, 3> has one chord (7, 11) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <11, 7, 3, 6> has one chord (3, 7) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <7, 3, 6, 13> has one chord (6, 7) and is a chordal 4-cycle
- <3, 6, 13, 1> has one chord (13, 6) and is a chordal 4-cycle

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
There are [37] chordal 4-cycles in the graph.
