The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 8) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 2) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 0) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 7) (3, 5) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 0) (4, 5) (4, 6) (4, 8) (4, 2) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 7) (2, 9) (2, 4) (2, 8) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 8) (7, 6) (7, 1) (7, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, 3, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 6, 1, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 8, 4, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 3, 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle <0, 5, 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle <0, 5, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle <0, 5, 4, 2, 8, 0>
- Cycle <1, 3, 0, 5, 9, 6, 7, 1>
- Cycle <2, 4, 5, 9, 6, 7, 8, 2>
- Cycle <3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 1, 3>
- Cycle <4, 5, 9, 6, 7, 8, 4>
- Cycle <5, 4, 2, 9, 6, 7, 8, 5>
- Cycle <6, 9, 5, 8, 4, 0, 6>
- Cycle <7, 6, 9, 5, 4, 8, 7>
- Cycle <8, 5, 0, 1, 7, 8>
- Cycle <9, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal cycle <0, 5, 4, 8, 0> with chord (5, 8)
- Chordal cycle <0, 5, 4, 2, 8, 0> with chord (4, 8)
- Chordal cycle <1, 3, 0, 5, 9, 6, 7, 1> with chord (3, 5)
- Chordal cycle <2, 4, 5, 9, 6, 7, 8, 2> with chord (4, 8)
- Chordal cycle <3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 1, 3> with chord (5, 6)
- Chordal cycle <4, 5, 9, 6, 7, 8, 4> with chord (5, 9)
- Chordal cycle <5, 4, 2, 9, 6, 7, 8, 5> with chord (4, 8)
- Chordal cycle <6, 9, 5, 8, 4, 0, 6> with chord (5, 8)
- Chordal cycle <7, 6, 9, 5, 4, 8, 7> with chord (6, 9)
- Chordal cycle <8, 5, 0, 1, 7, 8> with chord (0, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- There are [9] unique chordal 4-cycles found.
