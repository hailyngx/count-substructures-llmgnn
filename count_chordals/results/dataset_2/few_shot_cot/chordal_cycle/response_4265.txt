Response:
Step 1: List of all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle <0, 6, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle <0, 6, 9, 19, 13>
- Cycle <0, 4, 17, 16, 10>
- Cycle <2, 0, 4, 17, 16>
- Cycle <2, 18, 15, 4, 0>
- Cycle <4, 17, 16, 10, 12>
- Cycle <7, 1, 10, 12, 16>
- Cycle <13, 18, 15, 4, 0>
- Cycle <13, 19, 1, 10, 12>
- Cycle <13, 19, 1, 7, 13>

Step 2: Checking for the presence of exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chordal cycle <0, 6, 9, 8, 5> with chord (6, 8)
- Chordal cycle <0, 6, 9, 19, 13> with chord (6, 19)
- Chordal cycle <0, 4, 17, 16, 10> with chord (4, 16)
- Chordal cycle <2, 0, 4, 17, 16> with chord (2, 17)
- Chordal cycle <2, 18, 15, 4, 0> with chord (2, 15)
- Chordal cycle <4, 17, 16, 10, 12> with chord (4, 10)
- Chordal cycle <7, 1, 10, 12, 16> with chord (7, 16)
- Chordal cycle <13, 18, 15, 4, 0> with chord (13, 15)
- Chordal cycle <13, 19, 1, 10, 12> with chord (13, 1)
- Chordal cycle <13, 19, 1, 7, 13> with chord (19, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles:
There are 0 chordless cycles in this graph.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles is [10].
