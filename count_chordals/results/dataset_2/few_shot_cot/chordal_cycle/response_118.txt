Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (14, 17) (14, 11) (14, 8) (14, 2) (17, 14) (17, 0) (1, 16) (1, 4) (1, 12) (3, 12) (11, 14) (11, 2) (5, 19) (5, 0) (5, 10) (19, 5) (19, 18) (19, 16) (19, 0) (19, 12) (8, 14) (8, 16) (8, 6) (9, 4) (9, 2) (13, 4) (13, 0) (13, 6) (4, 1) (4, 9) (4, 13) (4, 12) (4, 10) (12, 1) (12, 3) (12, 19) (12, 4) (18, 19) (7, 6) (7, 2) (6, 8) (6, 13) (6, 7) (15, 16) (2, 14) (2, 11) (2, 9) (2, 7) (16, 1) (16, 19) (16, 8) (16, 15) (16, 10) (10, 5) (10, 4) (10, 16) (0, 17) (0, 5) (0, 19) (0, 13) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 17, 5, 19, and node 13
Node 1 is connected to node 16, 4, and node 12
Node 2 is connected to node 14, 11, 9, and node 7
Node 3 is connected to node 12
Node 4 is connected to node 1, 9, 13, 12, and node 10
Node 5 is connected to node 19, 0, and node 10
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 13, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 14, 16, and node 6
Node 9 is connected to node 4, and node 2
Node 10 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 16
Node 11 is connected to node 14, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 1, 3, 19, and node 4
Node 13 is connected to node 4, 0, and node 6
Node 14 is connected to node 17, 11, 8, and node 2
Node 15 is connected to node 16
Node 16 is connected to node 1, 19, 8, 15, and node 10
Node 17 is connected to node 14, and node 0
Node 18 is connected to node 19
Node 19 is connected to node 5, 18, 16, 0, and node 12

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, 5, 19, 12> with a single chord (0, 12).

Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final answer is [1].
