Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (1, 8, 13, 7)
- Cycle 2: (1, 11, 10, 5)
- Cycle 3: (1, 12, 7, 13)
- Cycle 4: (3, 4, 9, 14)
- Cycle 5: (3, 8, 13, 6)
- Cycle 6: (3, 7, 12, 4)
- Cycle 7: (3, 5, 0, 6)
- Cycle 8: (4, 9, 10, 11)
- Cycle 9: (5, 10, 2, 7)
- Cycle 10: (6, 13, 8, 1)
- Cycle 11: (6, 11, 1, 12)
- Cycle 12: (7, 13, 8, 4)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has no chords.
- Cycle 2 has no chords.
- Cycle 3 has no chords.
- Cycle 4 has chord <4, 9>.
- Cycle 5 has chord <8, 13>.
- Cycle 6 has chord <3, 12>.
- Cycle 7 has no chords.
- Cycle 8 has no chords.
- Cycle 9 has no chords.
- Cycle 10 has chord <6, 13>.
- Cycle 11 has no chords.
- Cycle 12 has no chords.

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found, which have exactly one chord: [4]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <4, 9>
- <8, 13>
- <3, 12>
- <6, 13>
