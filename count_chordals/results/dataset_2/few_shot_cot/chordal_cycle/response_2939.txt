Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 in the graph are:
1. <4, 8, 10, 5, 4>
2. <4, 9, 18, 3, 4>
3. <8, 4, 5, 10, 8>
4. <8, 10, 7, 17, 8>
5. <8, 3, 12, 17, 8>
6. <1, 11, 1>
7. <5, 4, 0, 6, 5>
8. <5, 10, 7, 17, 5>
9. <5, 14, 12, 17, 5>
10. <18, 9, 4, 5, 18>
11. <18, 3, 12, 14, 18>
12. <19, 13, 17, 7, 19>
13. <19, 16, 2, 17, 19>
14. <19, 6, 0, 13, 19>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
1. <4, 8, 10, 5>, chord: (4, 10)
2. <4, 9, 18, 3>, chord: (9, 3)
3. <5, 10, 7, 17>, chord: (10, 7)
4. <5, 14, 12, 17>, chord: (14, 12)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There are 10 chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the final number inside brackets is [4].
