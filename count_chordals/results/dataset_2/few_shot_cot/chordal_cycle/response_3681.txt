Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more in the given graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 13, 5, 4, 8, 1, 10, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 13, 1, 10, 7>
- Cycle 3: <0, 13, 5, 8, 6, 14, 1>
- Cycle 4: <0, 13, 5, 4, 11, 3, 10, 7>
- Cycle 5: <0, 13, 1, 14, 6, 8, 4, 5>
- Cycle 6: <0, 13, 1, 8, 6, 14, 12, 3>
- Cycle 7: <0, 13, 1, 14, 12, 3, 11, 2>
- Cycle 8: <0, 13, 1, 8, 4, 11, 3, 12>
- Cycle 9: <1, 8, 6, 14, 12, 3, 11, 4>
- Cycle 10: <1, 10, 7, 0, 13, 5, 4, 11>
- Cycle 11: <1, 14, 12, 3, 11, 4, 5, 8>

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 13, 5, 4, 8, 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 13, 5, 8, 6, 14>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 13, 1, 14, 6, 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 13, 1, 8, 4, 11>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, 8, 6, 14, 12, 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <1, 10, 7, 0, 13, 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, 14, 12, 3, 11, 4>

Step 3:
Count of chordal 4-cycles: [7]

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycles found inside <> are:
<0, 13, 5, 4, 8, 1>
<0, 13, 5, 8, 6, 14>
<0, 13, 1, 14, 6, 8>
<0, 13, 1, 8, 4, 11>
<1, 8, 6, 14, 12, 3>
<1, 10, 7, 0, 13, 5>
<1, 14, 12, 3, 11, 4>
