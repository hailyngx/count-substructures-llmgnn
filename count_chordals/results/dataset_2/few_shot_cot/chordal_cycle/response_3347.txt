Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:  
- <13, 22, 1, 24>  
- <13, 22, 18, 29>  
- <13, 22, 24, 25>  
- <13, 22, 1, 28>  
- <13, 22, 18, 24>  
- <13, 22, 1, 10>  
- <22, 18, 24, 25>  
- <22, 18, 24, 1>  
- <22, 18, 29, 16>  
- <22, 24, 25, 11>  
- <22, 24, 1, 28>  
- <24, 25, 11, 23>  
- <24, 25, 7, 1>  
- <24, 18, 29, 16>  
- <24, 18, 22, 13>  
- <25, 11, 23, 14>  
- <25, 7, 1, 28>  
- <25, 7, 1, 10>  
- <25, 7, 5, 4>  
- <25, 24, 18, 29>  
- <25, 24, 22, 13>  
- <28, 1, 10, 6>  
- <28, 1, 22, 13>  
- <28, 27, 26, 3>  
- <28, 27, 19, 8>  
- <28, 27, 19, 8>  
- <18, 22, 1, 24>  
- <18, 22, 13, 24>  
- <18, 24, 25, 11>  
- <18, 24, 1, 28>  

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only <24, 18, 29, 16> has exactly one chord which is (18, 29). 

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:  
- There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found.  

Therefore, the final answer is [1].
