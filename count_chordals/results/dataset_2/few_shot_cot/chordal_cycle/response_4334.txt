Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- (15, 27, 14, 26, 15)
- (2, 7, 9, 4, 11, 19, 18, 5, 17, 14, 26, 3, 20, 28, 15, 27, 14, 17, 12, 28, 20, 3, 22, 1)
- (2, 7, 9, 18, 29, 16, 28, 20, 3, 26, 14, 17, 5, 21, 22, 6, 25, 1, 28, 15, 26, 3, 22)
- (18, 13, 23, 16, 28, 15, 26, 14, 17, 5, 18, 29, 0, 2, 7, 8, 10, 24, 16, 29)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <15, 14, 26, 27> with chord (26, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <2, 7, 9, 18> with chord (9, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <18, 29, 16, 28> with chord (16, 29)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found, which is 0.
Therefore, the final count is [3].
