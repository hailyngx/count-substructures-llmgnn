Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <1, 5, 9, 7, 1> 
2. <1, 5, 9, 6, 1> 
3. <1, 7, 9, 5, 1> 
4. <1, 7, 9, 12, 3, 1> 
5. <1, 3, 12, 9, 5, 1> 
6. <1, 3, 12, 9, 7, 1> 
7. <1, 6, 9, 5, 1> 
8. <1, 6, 9, 7, 1> 
9. <1, 6, 3, 12, 9, 1> 
10. <1, 6, 3, 2, 8, 10, 7, 1> 
11. <1, 6, 3, 2, 13, 8, 10, 7, 1> 
12. <1, 6, 3, 2, 13, 8, 10, 11, 9, 7, 1> 
13. <1, 7, 9, 11, 10, 8, 3, 12, 7, 1> 
14. <3, 2, 6, 10, 7, 1> 
15. <3, 2, 6, 9, 5, 1> 
16. <3, 2, 6, 9, 7, 1> 
17. <3, 2, 6, 1, 5, 9, 7, 3> 
18. <3, 2, 6, 1, 7, 9, 5, 3> 
19. <7, 9, 11, 10, 8, 3, 12, 7> 
20. <11, 9, 5, 1, 7, 10, 6, 2, 3, 12, 11> 
21. <11, 9, 7, 10, 6, 2, 3, 12, 11> 
22. <12, 9, 11, 10, 7> 
23. <12, 9, 7, 10, 11> 

Step 2: 
The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
<1, 5, 9, 7> with chord (1, 7)
<1, 6, 9, 7> with chord (1, 7)
<1, 3, 12, 9> with chord (1, 12)
<3, 2, 6, 1> with chord (3, 6)
<3, 2, 6, 9> with chord (3, 6)
<7, 9, 11, 10> with chord (7, 11)
<12, 9, 11, 10> with chord (12, 11)

Step 3: 
Counting the number of chordless 4-cycles, we get [16].
