Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 4, 3, 5, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 1, 2, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, 3, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. Cycle: <0, 4, 7, 6>
2. Cycle: <0, 4, 7, 1>
3. Cycle: <0, 4, 7, 5>
4. Cycle: <0, 9, 8, 1>
5. Cycle: <0, 9, 8, 5>
6. Cycle: <0, 9, 8, 2>
7. Cycle: <0, 9, 2, 1>
8. Cycle: <0, 9, 2, 8>
9. Cycle: <1, 7, 4, 0>
10. Cycle: <1, 7, 5, 8>
11. Cycle: <1, 7, 5, 2>
12. Cycle: <1, 7, 6, 9>
13. Cycle: <2, 9, 8, 1>
14. Cycle: <2, 9, 8, 5>
15. Cycle: <2, 9, 8, 1>
16. Cycle: <3, 7, 4, 0>
17. Cycle: <3, 7, 5, 8>
18. Cycle: <3, 7, 5, 1>
19. Cycle: <3, 9, 2, 8>
20. Cycle: <5, 7, 4, 0>
21. Cycle: <5, 7, 1, 8>
22. Cycle: <5, 7, 1, 2>
23. Cycle: <5, 7, 6, 9>
24. Cycle: <6, 7, 4, 0>
25. Cycle: <6, 7, 3, 9>
26. Cycle: <6, 7, 3, 2>
27. Cycle: <6, 9, 8, 1>
28. Cycle: <6, 9, 8, 5>
29. Cycle: <6, 9, 8, 2>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the chordal 4-cycles are:
1. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 4, 7, 6>, Chord: (4, 6)
2. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 4, 7, 5>, Chord: (4, 5)
3. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, 8, 1>, Chord: (9, 1)
4. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, 8, 5>, Chord: (9, 5)
5. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, 8, 2>, Chord: (9, 2)
6. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, 2, 1>, Chord: (9, 2)
7. Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, 2, 8>, Chord: (9, 2)
8. Chordal 4-cycle: <1, 7, 6, 9>, Chord: (7, 9)
9. Chordal 4-cycle: <3, 7, 5, 8>, Chord: (7, 5)
10. Chordal 4-cycle: <5, 7, 6, 9>, Chord: (7, 9)

Step 3:
There are 10 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final result is [10].
