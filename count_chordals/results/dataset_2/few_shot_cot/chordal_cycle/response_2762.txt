Response:
Step 1: 
We need to find all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 15, 7, 10>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 18, 11, 10>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 12, 3, 5>
- Cycle 4: <0, 15, 7, 17, 19>
- Cycle 5: <1, 18, 11, 5, 3>
- Cycle 6: <1, 15, 7, 17, 19>
- Cycle 7: <3, 12, 1, 15, 7>
- Cycle 8: <4, 19, 17, 7, 10>
- Cycle 9: <4, 19, 16, 12, 3>
- Cycle 10: <4, 8, 11, 13, 16>
- Cycle 11: <4, 8, 11, 5, 3>
- Cycle 12: <4, 2, 6, 16, 13>
- Cycle 13: <5, 11, 8, 4, 19>
- Cycle 14: <5, 11, 13, 16, 19>
- Cycle 15: <5, 14, 9, 0, 1>
- Cycle 16: <7, 10, 11, 8, 4>
- Cycle 17: <7, 17, 19, 16, 13>
- Cycle 18: <7, 19, 4, 8, 11>
- Cycle 19: <7, 15, 1, 12, 3>
- Cycle 20: <9, 0, 1, 18, 11>
- Cycle 21: <9, 14, 5, 3, 12>
- Cycle 22: <10, 11, 8, 4, 2>
- Cycle 23: <10, 14, 9, 0, 1>
- Cycle 24: <11, 18, 1, 15, 7>
- Cycle 25: <11, 5, 14, 9, 0>
- Cycle 26: <12, 1, 15, 7, 17>
- Cycle 27: <12, 16, 19, 4, 8>
- Cycle 28: <13, 11, 18, 1, 15>
- Cycle 29: <16, 19, 17, 7, 15>
- Cycle 30: <16, 12, 1, 15, 7>

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, 1, 15, 7, 10> has one chord: (15, 7)
- <0, 1, 18, 11, 10> has one chord: (18, 11)
- <3, 12, 1, 15, 7> has one chord: (1, 7)
- <4, 19, 17, 7, 10> has one chord: (17, 10)
- <4, 19, 16, 12, 3> has one chord: (16, 3)
- <5, 11, 13, 16, 19> has one chord: (13, 16)
- <7, 10, 11, 8, 4> has one chord: (11, 8)
- <9, 14, 5, 3, 12> has one chord: (5, 12)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph, so the count is [8].
