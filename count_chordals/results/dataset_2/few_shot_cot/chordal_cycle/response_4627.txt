Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 0 -> 14 -> 3 -> 15 -> 0
- Cycle 0 -> 14 -> 25 -> 4 -> 0
- Cycle 0 -> 12 -> 18 -> 26 -> 23 -> 20 -> 13 -> 11 -> 0
- Cycle 0 -> 12 -> 18 -> 26 -> 29 -> 14 -> 25 -> 17 -> 4 -> 0

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Checking cycle 0 -> 14 -> 3 -> 15 -> 0, there is a chord: (14, 15)
- Checking cycle 0 -> 14 -> 25 -> 4 -> 0, there is a chord: (14, 4)
- Checking cycle 0 -> 12 -> 18 -> 26 -> 23 -> 20 -> 13 -> 11 -> 0, there is a chord: (18, 11)
- Checking cycle 0 -> 12 -> 18 -> 26 -> 29 -> 14 -> 25 -> 17 -> 4 -> 0, there is a chord: (14, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [0]
