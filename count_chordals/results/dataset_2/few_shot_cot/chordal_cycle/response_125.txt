Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (10, 0) (10, 14) (11, 3) (11, 12) (8, 16) (8, 17) (13, 17) (13, 16) (13, 2) (13, 1) (2, 13) (2, 18) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 14) (18, 2) (18, 15) (18, 12) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 17) (3, 11) (3, 17) (3, 19) (0, 10) (0, 5) (7, 14) (7, 9) (5, 2) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 19) (5, 15) (19, 3) (19, 5) (19, 6) (17, 8) (17, 13) (17, 4) (17, 3) (1, 13) (1, 4) (1, 14) (1, 12) (14, 10) (14, 2) (14, 7) (14, 1) (16, 8) (16, 13) (9, 7) (6, 2) (6, 19) (15, 18) (15, 5) (15, 12) (12, 11) (12, 18) (12, 1) (12, 15)

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: 0 - 10 - 14 - 2 - 13 - 17 - 4 - 5 - 0
- Cycle 2: 3 - 11 - 12 - 1 - 13 - 17 - 4 - 5 - 3
- Cycle 3: 2 - 13 - 17 - 3 - 19 - 6 - 2
- Cycle 4: 5 - 2 - 18 - 15 - 5
- Cycle 5: 18 - 12 - 1 - 4 - 17 - 13 - 2 - 18
- Cycle 6: 4 - 17 - 13 - 2 - 18 - 12 - 11 - 3 - 4
- Cycle 7: 14 - 7 - 9 - 7
- Cycle 8: 19 - 3 - 11 - 12 - 18 - 15 - 5 - 19
- Cycle 9: 16 - 8 - 17 - 4 - 5 - 15 - 12 - 18 - 16

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (2, 17): <0, (2, 17), 5, 10, 14>
- Cycle 2 has exactly one chord (1, 12): <3, (1, 12), 11, 17, 4>
- Cycle 4 has exactly one chord (5, 15): <5, (5, 15), 2, 13, 18>
- Cycle 5 has exactly one chord (1, 4): <18, (1, 4), 12, 17, 13>
- Cycle 7 has exactly one chord (7, 9): <7, (7, 9), 14, 10>
- Cycle 8 has exactly one chord (3, 18): <19, (3, 18), 11, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 4 chordless cycles, so the final number is [4].
