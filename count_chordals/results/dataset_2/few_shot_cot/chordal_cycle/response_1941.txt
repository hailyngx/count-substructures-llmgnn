Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 4) (9, 6) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (4, 1) (8, 5) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 0) (5, 7) (2, 1) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 5) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 1) (7, 8) (7, 5) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 1) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 4) (3, 8) (3, 7) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 5, 2, 7, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 0, and node 7
Node 2 is connected to node 1, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 6, 9, 4, 8, and node 7
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 8, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 5, 3, and node 4
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 5, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:

- Cycle 1: <0, 9, 1, 7, 0> (chords: (9, 7))
- Cycle 2: <0, 9, 6, 5, 0> (chords: (9, 5))
- Cycle 3: <0, 9, 6, 4, 1, 0> (chords: (9, 4))
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 6, 4, 1, 0> (chords: (5, 1) or (6, 4))
- Cycle 5: <3, 6, 9, 1, 4, 3> (chords: (6, 4))
- Cycle 6: <5, 6, 9, 1, 7, 5> (chords: (6, 7))
- Cycle 7: <7, 8, 5, 6, 9, 7> (chords: (5, 9) or (6, 8))
- Cycle 8: <7, 5, 6, 3, 8, 7> (chords: (5, 8) or (6, 3))

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 9, 1, 7, 0> (chord: (9, 7))

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found:
- Number of chordal 4-cycles found: [1]
