Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 

<0, 5, 17, 13> 
<0, 5, 2, 8> 
<0, 10, 16, 8> 
<0, 10, 14, 18> 
<0, 1, 15, 3> 
<1, 15, 3, 7> 
<1, 18, 14, 10> 
<2, 5, 17, 13> 
<3, 7, 11, 12> 
<3, 7, 10, 16> 
<3, 15, 1, 18> 
<4, 17, 5, 12> 
<4, 9, 11, 7> 
<4, 17, 8, 16> 
<5, 2, 8, 16> 
<5, 2, 19, 13> 
<5, 12, 11, 7> 
<7, 3, 15, 1> 
<7, 11, 9, 4> 
<8, 2, 19, 13> 
<9, 4, 17, 5>

<10, 16, 9, 4> 
<10, 16, 8, 2> 
<10, 7, 3, 15> 
<11, 9, 19, 13> 
<12, 18, 14, 10> 
<13, 19, 9, 11> 
<14, 18, 1, 0> 

Step 2: 
Checking for cycles with exactly one chord: 

<0, 5, 17, 13> 
<0, 5, 2, 8> 
<0, 10, 16, 8> 
<0, 10, 14, 18> 
<0, 1, 15, 3> 

Step 3:
