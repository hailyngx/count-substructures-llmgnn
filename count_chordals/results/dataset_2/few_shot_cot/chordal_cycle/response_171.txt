Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <0, 4, 8, 1, 0>
        - <0, 4, 2, 8, 0>
        - <0, 4, 2, 1, 0>
        - <0, 8, 2, 4, 0>
        - <1, 0, 4, 7, 1>
        - <1, 0, 8, 5, 1>
        - <1, 2, 4, 7, 1>
        - <1, 2, 8, 5, 1>
        - <2, 4, 7, 3, 2>
        - <2, 4, 8, 5, 2>
        - <2, 3, 7, 4, 2>
        - <2, 3, 0, 1, 2>
        - <3, 7, 4, 8, 3>
        - <3, 7, 1, 0, 3>
        - <4, 6, 1, 9, 4>
        - <4, 6, 7, 3, 4>
        - <4, 7, 1, 9, 4>
        - <4, 7, 3, 2, 4>
        - <5, 8, 4, 7, 5>
        - <5, 8, 0, 3, 5>
        - <6, 1, 9, 5, 6>
        - <7, 3, 0, 8, 7>
        - <8, 4, 7, 1, 8>
        - <8, 4, 0, 3, 8>
        - <8, 5, 9, 1, 8>

Step 2: Checking for cycles with exactly one chord:
        - The cycle <1, 0, 4, 7, 1> has exactly one chord (4, 7)

Step 3: Count of chordal 4-cycles: [1]

Unique chordal 4-cycle found:
<1, 0, 4, 7, 1>
