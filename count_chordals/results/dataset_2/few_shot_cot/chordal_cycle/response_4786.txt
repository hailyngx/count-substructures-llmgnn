Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 5) (9, 6) (9, 4) (9, 3) (9, 1) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 0) (6, 9) (6, 7) (6, 2) (6, 8) (8, 5) (8, 4) (8, 6) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 5) (2, 6) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 9) (0, 4) (0, 3) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 4, 3, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, and node 9
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 7, 8, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 7, 2, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 6
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 4, 6, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 6, 4, 3, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle <0, 9, 5, 1> with chords (0, 5)
- Cycle <0, 9, 3, 7> with chords (9, 7)
- Cycle <0, 4, 9, 1> with chords (0, 9)
- Cycle <0, 4, 8, 6> with chords (4, 8)
- Cycle <0, 3, 9, 5> with chords (3, 5)
- Cycle <1, 5, 9, 3> with chords (1, 9)
- Cycle <2, 5, 9, 1> with chords (2, 9)
- Cycle <2, 5, 8, 4> with chords (5, 8)
- Cycle <2, 6, 9, 4> with chords (6, 4)
- Cycle <3, 9, 4, 7> with chords (3, 4)
- Cycle <4, 9, 5, 2> with chords (4, 5)
- Cycle <6, 9, 5, 8> with chords (6, 5)
- Cycle <6, 7, 4, 8> with chords (6, 8)
- Cycle <7, 4, 9, 5> with chords (7, 5)
- Cycle <8, 5, 9, 3> with chords (8, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycles: 
  - Chordal cycle <0, 9, 5, 1> with chords (0, 5)
  - Chordal cycle <0, 4, 9, 1> with chords (0, 9)
  - Chordal cycle <2, 6, 9, 4> with chords (6, 4)
  - Chordal cycle <3, 9, 4, 7> with chords (3, 4)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Count = [11]
