Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph with existing edges are:
- <0, 5, 4, 0>
- <0, 5, 4, 7>
- <0, 5, 2, 1>
- <0, 5, 2, 11>
- <0, 5, 10, 9>
- <0, 5, 10, 1>
- <0, 5, 10, 2>
- <0, 5, 10, 9>
- <0, 5, 10, 2>
- <0, 5, 10, 1>
- <0, 5, 10, 9>
- <0, 5, 10, 1>
- <0, 5, 10, 2>
- <0, 5, 10, 9>
- <0, 5, 10, 2>
- <0, 5, 10, 1>
- <0, 5, 10, 9>
- <0, 5, 10, 1>
- <0, 5, 10, 2>

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the cycles with exactly one chord are:
- <0, 5, 4, 0> (Chord: (5, 4))
- <0, 5, 4, 7> (Chord: (4, 7))
- <0, 5, 2, 1> (Chord: (5, 2))
- <0, 5, 2, 11> (Chord: (5, 2))
- <0, 5, 10, 9> (Chord: (9, 10))
- <0, 5, 10, 1> (Chord: (10, 1))
- <0, 5, 10, 2> (Chord: (10, 2))

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles found is [0].
