Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <3, 0, 12, 6, 4>
- Cycle 2: <3, 14, 7, 1, 4>
- Cycle 3: <3, 14, 8, 13, 10>
- Cycle 4: <5, 1, 4, 6, 11>
- Cycle 5: <5, 3, 14, 8, 13>
- Cycle 6: <5, 1, 14, 9, 10>
- Cycle 7: <11, 3, 0, 12, 6>
- Cycle 8: <11, 5, 1, 4, 6>
- Cycle 9: <11, 4, 12, 0, 3>
- Cycle 10: <11, 5, 3, 14, 8>
- Cycle 11: <11, 4, 1, 7, 14>
- Cycle 12: <12, 0, 3, 14, 8>
- Cycle 13: <12, 0, 5, 2, 9>
- Cycle 14: <12, 1, 5, 2, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:

The unique chordal 4-cycle is <3, 14, 8, 13, 10> with a chord (node 8, node 13).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found. There is only one unique chordal 4-cycle in the graph.

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles is [0].
