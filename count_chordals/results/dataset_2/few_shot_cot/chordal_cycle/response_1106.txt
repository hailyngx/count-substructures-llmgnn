Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 10, 3, 27>, Chord: (0, 3)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, 23, 8, 21>, Chord: (23, 21)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <2, 24, 4, 19>, Chord: (24, 19)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
