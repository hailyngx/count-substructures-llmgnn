Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph is <0, 7, 26, 16> with the non-adjacent chord (25, 24).

Following the steps provided:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- 4-cycle: <0, 7, 9, 22>
- 4-cycle: <0, 7, 26, 16>
- 4-cycle: <0, 25, 24, 16>
- 4-cycle: <1, 11, 16, 24>
- 4-cycle: <1, 11, 16, 26>
- 4-cycle: <1, 11, 10, 16>
- 4-cycle: <3, 27, 26, 16>
- 4-cycle: <6, 0, 7, 26>
- 4-cycle: <7, 9, 4, 13>
- 4-cycle: <7, 9, 12, 28>
- 4-cycle: <7, 9, 17, 4>
- 4-cycle: <11, 16, 24, 2>
- 4-cycle: <15, 8, 21, 29>
- 4-cycle: <18, 17, 9, 12>
- 4-cycle: <21, 27, 3, 14>
- 4-cycle: <21, 27, 25, 24>
- 4-cycle: <25, 0, 6, 14>
- 4-cycle: <25, 1, 20, 11>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
- Chordal 4-cycle found: <0, 7, 26, 16> has a chord (25, 24).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
As there is only one unique chordal 4-cycle found, the count is [1].
