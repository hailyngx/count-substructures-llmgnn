Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 9, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 7, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 1, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: (0, 1, 5, 6) (with edges (0, 1), (1, 5), (5, 6), (6, 0))
- Cycle 2: (0, 1, 7, 4) (with edges (0, 1), (1, 7), (7, 4), (4, 0))
- Cycle 3: (0, 1, 9, 4) (with edges (0, 1), (1, 9), (9, 4), (4, 0))
- Cycle 4: (0, 2, 3, 5) (with edges (0, 2), (2, 3), (3, 5), (5, 0))
- Cycle 5: (0, 2, 3, 4) (with edges (0, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0))
- Cycle 6: (0, 2, 1, 7) (with edges (0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 7), (7, 0))
- Cycle 7: (0, 3, 4, 7) (with edges (0, 3), (3, 4), (4, 7), (7, 0))
- Cycle 8: (0, 3, 4, 8) (with edges (0, 3), (3, 4), (4, 8), (8, 0))
- Cycle 9: (0, 3, 2, 1) (with edges (0, 3), (3, 2), (2, 1), (1, 0))
- Cycle 10: (1, 7, 4, 9) (with edges (1, 7), (7, 4), (4, 9), (9, 1))
- Cycle 11: (1, 7, 4, 8) (with edges (1, 7), (7, 4), (4, 8), (8, 1))
- Cycle 12: (1, 7, 0, 9) (with edges (1, 7), (7, 0), (0, 9), (9, 1))
- Cycle 13: (1, 5, 6, 4) (with edges (1, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (4, 1))
- Cycle 14: (2, 1, 9, 4) (with edges (2, 1), (1, 9), (9, 4), (4, 2))
- Cycle 15: (3, 5, 6, 4) (with edges (3, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4), (4, 3))
- Cycle 16: (3, 4, 7, 1) (with edges (3, 4), (4, 7), (7, 1), (1, 3))
- Cycle 17: (4, 6, 5, 1) (with edges (4, 6), (6, 5), (5, 1), (1, 4))
- Cycle 18: (4, 9, 7, 1) (with edges (4, 9), (9, 7), (7, 1), (1, 4))

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (4-cycle) are:
- <1, 7, 4, 9> (Chord: (1, 9))
- <1, 7, 4, 8> (Chord: (1, 8))
- <1, 7, 0, 9> (Chord: (1, 0))

Step 3:
There are 3 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [3].
