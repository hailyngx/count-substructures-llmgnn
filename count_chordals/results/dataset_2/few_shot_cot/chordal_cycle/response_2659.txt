21. <4, 9, 5, 13>
22. <4, 10, 6, 11>
23. <4, 10, 12, 5>
24. <4, 13, 5, 2>
25. <4, 13, 14, 12>
26. <4, 14, 8, 1>
27. <4, 14, 12, 2>
28. <5, 9, 11, 2>
29. <5, 12, 14, 4>
30. <6, 10, 12, 14>
31. <6, 11, 9, 4>
32. <7, 0, 6, 10>
33. <7, 3, 9, 11>

1. <0, 5, 2, 12, (14, 4)>
2. <0, 6, 11, 1, (10, 4)>
3. <0, 7, 4, 14, (12, 2)>
4. <1, 11, 6, 10, (2, 4)>
5. <1, 13, 5, 2, (9, 11)>
6. <2, 5, 9, 11, (13, 12)>
7. <2, 10, 4, 14, (6, 12)>
8. <4, 7, 0, 5, (9, 13)>
9. <4, 9, 11, 1, (13, 5)>
10. <4, 10, 6, 11, (2, 14)>
