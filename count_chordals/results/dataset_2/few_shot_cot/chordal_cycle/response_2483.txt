Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 in the graph are as follows:
1. Cycle <0, 4, 7, 1>
2. Cycle <0, 4, 8, 5>
3. Cycle <0, 4, 6, 8>
4. Cycle <0, 4, 6, 7>
5. Cycle <0, 4, 2, 5>
6. Cycle <1, 7, 4, 8>
7. Cycle <1, 7, 4, 6>
8. Cycle <1, 7, 10, 3>
9. Cycle <1, 7, 10, 11>
10. Cycle <2, 4, 7, 1>
11. Cycle <2, 4, 6, 8>
12. Cycle <3, 10, 7, 4>
13. Cycle <3, 10, 11, 14>
14. Cycle <4, 7, 13, 12>
15. Cycle <5, 8, 4, 0>
16. Cycle <6, 4, 7, 1>
17. Cycle <9, 14, 8, 5>
18. Cycle <9, 14, 11, 3>
19. Cycle <10, 7, 13, 12>
20. Cycle <11, 3, 12, 1>
21. Cycle <12, 1, 7, 10>
22. Cycle <13, 12, 11, 14>

Step 2:
The unique chordal 4-cycle, with exactly one chord, in the graph is:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 4, 6, 8>, chord: (4, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, there are 21 cycles, and only one of them is a chordal 4-cycle. Therefore, the answer is [1].
