Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- <1, 6, 11, 5>
- <2, 6, 11, 10>
- <2, 6, 13, 9>
- <2, 11, 5, 14>
- <2, 10, 0, 8>
- <2, 11, 5, 3>
- <4, 2, 6, 1>
- <4, 2, 6, 13>
- <4, 0, 10, 8>
- <4, 0, 8, 12>
- <4, 3, 12, 14>
- <4, 5, 11, 6>
- <5, 11, 10, 0>
- <5, 11, 2, 6>
- <5, 3, 12, 1>
- <5, 14, 9, 1>
- <7, 8, 10, 0>
- <7, 1, 6, 2>
- <7, 13, 6, 2>
- <8, 0, 10, 11>
- <13, 9, 14, 5>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in the cycles:
- <1, 6, 11, 5> has one chord (1, 11)
- <2, 6, 11, 10> has one chord (6, 10)
- <2, 6, 13, 9> has one chord (6, 9)
- <2, 10, 0, 8> has one chord (10, 8)
- <4, 0, 8, 12> has one chord (0, 8)
- <4, 3, 12, 14> has one chord (3, 12)
- <4, 5, 11, 6> has one chord (5, 11)
- <5, 11, 10, 0> has one chord (10, 0)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles:
There are 8 chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].
