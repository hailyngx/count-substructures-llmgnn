Response:
The chordal 4-cycles in the given graph are as follows:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 13, 4, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 7, 10, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 5, 14, 11, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 8, 12, 2, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 8, 12, 14, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 8, 3, 5, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 8, 3, 9, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 8, 3, 9, 0>
- Cycle 11: <1, 8, 3, 9, 7>
- Cycle 12: <1, 8, 3, 9, 2>
- Cycle 13: <1, 14, 11, 10, 1>
- Cycle 14: <1, 14, 11, 2, 1>
- Cycle 15: <1, 14, 6, 13, 1>
- Cycle 16: <2, 11, 14, 6, 2>
- Cycle 17: <2, 11, 14, 12, 2>
- Cycle 18: <2, 11, 14, 1, 2>
- Cycle 19: <2, 7, 5, 13, 2>
- Cycle 20: <2, 7, 5, 0, 2>
- Cycle 21: <2, 7, 5, 3, 2>
- Cycle 22: <2, 7, 5, 0, 10, 2>
- Cycle 23: <3, 8, 12, 2, 3>
- Cycle 24: <3, 8, 12, 14, 3>
- Cycle 25: <3, 8, 1, 0, 3>
- Cycle 26: <3, 8, 1, 7, 3>
- Cycle 27: <3, 9, 2, 11, 3>
- Cycle 28: <4, 13, 6, 14, 4>
- Cycle 29: <4, 13, 5, 7, 4>
- Cycle 30: <5, 13, 6, 14, 5>
- Cycle 31: <5, 14, 11, 10, 5>
- Cycle 32: <6, 13, 5, 7, 6>
- Cycle 33: <7, 10, 11, 14, 7>
- Cycle 34: <8, 12, 14, 11, 8>
- Cycle 35: <9, 0, 10, 11, 9>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- <1, 8, 12, 2, 1> has chord (8, 2)
- <1, 14, 6, 13, 1> has chord (14, 13)
- <2, 11, 14, 12, 2> has chord (11, 12)
- <3, 8, 12, 14, 3> has chord (8, 14)
- <4, 13, 6, 14, 4> has chord (13, 14)
- <5, 13, 6, 14, 5> has chord (13, 14)
- <9, 0, 10, 11, 9> has chord (0, 11)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 35 cycles in total, and 29 of them are chordless.

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [29].
