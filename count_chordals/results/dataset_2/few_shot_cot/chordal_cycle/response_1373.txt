Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 2) (5, 8) (5, 1) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 1) (9, 7) (9, 0) (4, 9) (4, 1) (4, 6) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 3) (7, 2) (7, 8) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 4) (1, 6) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 3) (2, 5) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 8) (0, 9) (0, 7) (0, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 8
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, and node 6
Node 2 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, and node 8
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 6, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 6, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, 1, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, 3, 2, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 7, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 2, 1, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: 
There are several cycles of length 4 in the graph, such as:
- Cycle 1: (1, 5, 6, 4, 1)
- Cycle 2: (2, 5, 6, 3, 2)
- Cycle 3: (3, 7, 0, 9, 3)
- Cycle 4: (4, 9, 7, 3, 4)
- Cycle 5: (5, 6, 3, 8, 5)
- Cycle 6: (6, 1, 4, 9, 6)
- Cycle 7: (7, 3, 6, 5, 7)
- Cycle 8: (8, 3, 7, 9, 8)
- Cycle 9: (9, 0, 7, 3, 9)
- Cycle 10: (0, 7, 9, 4, 0)

Step 2:
Out of these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
- <1, (4, 6), 1>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [9].
