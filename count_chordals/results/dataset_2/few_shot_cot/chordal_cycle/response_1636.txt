Node 9 is connected to node 6, 4, 2, 1, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
There are 4-cycles in the graph: 
- Cycle 1: (0, 2, 9, 6)

- Cycle 6: (0, 5, 8, 6)
- Cycle 7: (0, 5, 4, 9)
- Cycle 8: (0, 5, 7, 9)
- Cycle 9: (0, 7, 9, 6)
- Cycle 10: (0, 7, 3, 8)
- Cycle 11: (0, 7, 5, 4)
- Cycle 12: (0, 7, 3, 4)
- Cycle 13: (0, 7, 9, 4)
- Cycle 14: (1, 6, 9, 4)
- Cycle 15: (1, 6, 9, 7)
- Cycle 16: (1, 6, 9, 2)
- Cycle 17: (2, 9, 7, 5)
- Cycle 18: (2, 9, 4, 0)
- Cycle 19: (2, 9, 4, 5)
- Cycle 20: (2, 9, 4, 3)

- Cycle 31: (5, 8, 3, 7)
- Cycle 32: (5, 8, 6, 1)
- Cycle 33: (5, 8, 6, 0)
- Cycle 34: (6, 9, 4, 5)
- Cycle 35: (6, 9, 7, 3)
- Cycle 36: (6, 9, 1, 0)
- Cycle 37: (7, 9, 2, 4)
- Cycle 38: (7, 9, 4, 0)
- Cycle 39: (7, 9, 4, 5)
- Cycle 40: (7, 3, 8, 5)

Step 2:
The chordal 4-cycle is: 
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (6, 9), 4, 7> or <1, (9, 6), 4, 7>

Step 3:
The number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [39].
