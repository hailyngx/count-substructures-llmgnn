Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 6) (7, 2) (7, 9) (7, 5) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (8, 7) (8, 1) (8, 5) (5, 7) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 4) (6, 1) (6, 5) (2, 7) (2, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (9, 4) (9, 7) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 6, 5, 9, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, and node 9
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 0, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 6
Node 5 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 8, 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 5
Node 7 is connected to node 2, 9, 5, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 7, 1, 3, and node 2

Response:
Step 1: 
There are the following cycles of length 4 in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-3-5-0
- Cycle 2: 1-3-5-7-1
- Cycle 3: 1-5-8-7-1
- Cycle 4: 1-6-4-9-1
- Cycle 5: 3-1-6-4-3
- Cycle 6: 3-5-8-7-3
- Cycle 7: 4-3-5-6-4
- Cycle 8: 5-1-6-4-5
- Cycle 9: 5-7-8-1-5
- Cycle 10: 7-5-8-1-7

Step 2:
After checking each cycle, we find that cycles 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 have exactly one chord.

Step 3:
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].

The unique chordal 4-cycles are:
1. <0, (1, 3), 5>
2. <1, (5, 8), 7>
3. <3, (1, 6), 5>
4. <5, (3, 8), 7>
5. <7, (5, 8), 1>
