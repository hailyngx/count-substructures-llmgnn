Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (1, 2) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 0) (3, 9) (3, 5) (4, 9) (4, 5) (4, 2) (8, 2) (8, 9) (8, 6) (8, 7) (2, 1) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 0) (2, 6) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 5) (0, 9) (7, 8) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 5) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 8) (9, 0) (9, 7) (6, 8) (6, 2) (6, 7) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, 5, and node 9
Node 1 is connected to node 2, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 4, 8, 0, and node 6
Node 3 is connected to node 0, 9, and node 5
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 5, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 3, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 7
Node 7 is connected to node 8, 6, 9, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 2, 9, 6, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 4, 8, 0, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 9, 3, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 9, 4, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 3, 9, 4, 5, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 5, 4, 2, 8, 6, 7, 9, 0>
- Cycle 7: <1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 9, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 2, 4, 9, 7, 6, 8, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 9, 7, 5, 4, 2, 8, 6, 1>
- Cycle 10: <2, 0, 1, 9, 3, 5, 4, 2>
- Cycle 11: <2, 0, 3, 5, 7, 6, 8, 2>
- Cycle 12: <2, 4, 9, 7, 5, 3, 0, 2>
- Cycle 13: <3, 0, 1, 9, 7, 6, 8, 2, 3>
- Cycle 14: <3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 2, 4, 3>
- Cycle 15: <4, 5, 3, 0, 1, 9, 4>

Step 2:
Out of the above cycles, there is only one chordal 4-cycle:
- Unique Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 0> with chord (2, 5)

Step 3:
Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle in the graph, the number of chordless 4-cycles is [0].
