Response:
Step 1: List of cycles:
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 3, 6, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 1, 14, 9, 5, 10, 7, 11, 2, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 1, 14, 9, 5, 10, 6, 3, 12, 2, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 1, 14, 9, 5, 13, 12, 3, 6, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 1, 14, 9, 13, 12, 2, 3, 6, 10, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 7, 11, 2, 12, 0>
- Cycle 7: <0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 7, 11, 4, 9, 14, 6>
- Cycle 8: <1, 3, 6, 10, 0>

Step 2: List of chordal 4-cycles:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <<0, 1, 14, 9, 5, 10, 7, 11, 2, 0>, (12, 3)>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <<0, 1, 14, 9, 13, 12, 2, 3, 6, 10, 0>, (5, 10)>

Step 3: Count of chordless cycles = [6]
