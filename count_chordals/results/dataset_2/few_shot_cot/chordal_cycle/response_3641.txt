Response:
Following the steps provided, let's find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- We have the following cycles of length 4: 
    - Cycle 1: <0, 14, 13, 4, 0>
    - Cycle 2: <0, 14, 9, 12, 2, 13, 4, 0>
    - Cycle 3: <0, 14, 9, 12, 6, 7, 11, 0>
    - Cycle 4: <0, 11, 7, 6, 12, 9, 14, 0>
    - Cycle 5: <0, 11, 7, 6, 12, 2, 13, 0>
    - Cycle 6: <0, 11, 9, 12, 6, 7, 3, 0>
    - Cycle 7: <0, 1, 8, 11, 7, 6, 12, 2, 13, 0>
    - Cycle 8: <0, 3, 7, 11, 8, 1, 10, 13, 0>
    - Cycle 9: <0, 3, 7, 11, 9, 12, 6, 8, 1, 10, 13, 0>
    - Cycle 10: <0, 13, 10, 1, 8, 11, 7, 6, 12, 2, 14, 0>
    - Cycle 11: <9, 12, 2, 13, 4, 10, 1, 8, 11, 7, 3, 5, 9>
    - Cycle 12: <9, 12, 2, 10, 1, 8, 6, 11, 7, 3, 9>
    - Cycle 13: <9, 11, 7, 3, 5, 9>
    - Cycle 14: <1, 10, 13, 4, 9, 3, 5, 1>
    - Cycle 15: <1, 10, 13, 4, 9, 12, 6, 11, 7, 3, 8, 1>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- After checking each cycle, we find that Cycle 1, Cycle 3, Cycle 5, Cycle 6, and Cycle 13 have exactly one chord each.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There are 5 chordal 4-cycles found with exactly one chord.

Therefore, the final count inside brackets is [5]. The unique chordal 4-cycles are as follows:
<0, 14, 13, 4> 
<0, 11, 7, 6>
<0, 11, 7, 12>
<0, 11, 9, 12>
<9, 11, 7, 3>
