Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- <1, (5, 10), 2>
- <16, (5, 12), 10>
- <8, (11, 13), 1>
- <16, (5, 9), 12>
- <15, (4, 18), 5>
- <15, (5, 9), 18>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 33 chordless cycles found, thus [33].
