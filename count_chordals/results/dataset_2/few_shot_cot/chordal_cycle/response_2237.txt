This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 0) (5, 3) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 2) (7, 8) (7, 1) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 7) (6, 5) (6, 4) (6, 3) (0, 5) (0, 4) (0, 7) (0, 3) (1, 5) (1, 7) (1, 2) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 6) (3, 0) (3, 2) (2, 9) (2, 7) (2, 1) (2, 3)

Node 5 is connected to node 6, 1, 0, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 3
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 2, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 8, 4, and node 2

Response:
Let's follow the steps to find the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph:

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- We can see that there are several cycles of length 4 in the graph, such as (0, 4, 7, 1), (0, 7, 2, 1), (2, 1, 7, 4), and more.

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Among the cycles found in step 1, we need to identify the cycles with exactly one chord.
- One of the cycles with exactly one chord is <5, (6, 4), 3> where the chord is edge (6, 4).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- Since we found one chordal 4-cycle, we can put the final count inside brackets: [1].

Therefore, the unique chordal 4-cycle found in the given graph is <5, (6, 4), 3>, and the total number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
