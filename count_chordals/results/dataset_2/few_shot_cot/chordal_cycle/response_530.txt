Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: 1-6-4-9-2-1
- Cycle 2: 0-3-1-6-0
- Cycle 3: 0-3-6-1-4-0
- Cycle 4: 0-3-6-4-9-0
- Cycle 5: 0-3-1-4-0
- Cycle 6: 0-3-4-6-0
- Cycle 7: 0-3-6-2-0
- Cycle 8: 0-3-9-4-0
- Cycle 9: 0-6-1-3-0
- Cycle 10: 0-6-2-9-0
- Cycle 11: 0-6-4-3-0
- Cycle 12: 1-6-3-0-1
- Cycle 13: 1-3-0-6-1
- Cycle 14: 1-3-6-4-1
- Cycle 15: 4-6-1-3-4
- Cycle 16: 4-6-3-1-4
- Cycle 17: 4-3-6-1-4
- Cycle 18: 6-1-3-4-6
- Cycle 19: 6-1-4-3-6
- Cycle 20: 6-3-1-4-6
- Cycle 21: 6-3-4-1-6
- Cycle 22: 6-4-1-3-6
- Cycle 23: 6-4-3-1-6

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycles in the graph are:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, (3, 6), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, (3, 4), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, (3, 6), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, (3, 9), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <0, (3, 1), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <0, (3, 6), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <1, (3, 6), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <1, (6, 3), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <1, (6, 4), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <3, (1, 6), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <3, (6, 1), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <3, (6, 4), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <4, (1, 3), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <4, (3, 1), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle 15: <4, (3, 6), 1>
- Chordal 4-cycle 16: <6, (1, 3), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 17: <6, (3, 1), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 18: <6, (3, 4), 1>

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

There are 18 chordal 4-cycles found in the graph, so the final count is [18].
