Response:
In this graph, we will go through the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles.

Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
We will consider all cycles of length 4 in this graph.

The cycles of length 4 are as follows:
- <0, 4, 8, 5, 0>
- <0, 7, 14, 13, 11, 3, 0>
- <1, 2, 3, 7, 1>
- <1, 2, 10, 9, 4, 8, 5, 12, 1>
- <1, 6, 7, 14, 9, 4, 0, 1>
- <2, 5, 4, 9, 14, 7, 3, 11, 2>
- <3, 4, 9, 14, 7, 10, 3>
- <5, 12, 9, 4, 8, 14, 13, 11, 5>
- <7, 14, 8, 4, 9, 12, 1, 6, 7>
- <10, 9, 14, 7, 3, 11, 12, 10>
- <11, 12, 9, 4, 5, 2, 1, 6, 11>
- <13, 14, 9, 4, 5, 2, 3, 7, 13>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.
The cycle <1, 2, 3, 7, 1> has one chord: (2, 7).
The cycle <1, 6, 7, 14, 9, 4, 0, 1> has one chord: (7, 9).
The cycle <3, 4, 9, 14, 7, 10, 3> has one chord: (9, 7).
The cycle <10, 9, 14, 7, 3, 11, 12, 10> has one chord: (9, 11).
The cycle <13, 14, 9, 4, 5, 2, 3, 7, 13> has one chord: (9, 3).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
