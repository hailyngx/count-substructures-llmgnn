Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 14, 10)
- Cycle 2: (5, 9, 14, 15)
- Cycle 3: (5, 7, 3, 15)
- Cycle 4: (5, 17, 4, 13)
- Cycle 5: (5, 17, 4, 11)
- Cycle 6: (5, 17, 2, 1)
- Cycle 7: (5, 0, 11, 3)
- Cycle 8: (14, 10, 8, 1)
- Cycle 9: (14, 15, 3, 7)
- Cycle 10: (14, 15, 2, 1)
- Cycle 11: (14, 0, 11, 3)
- Cycle 12: (15, 17, 4, 13)
- Cycle 13: (15, 17, 4, 11)
- Cycle 14: (15, 17, 2, 1)
- Cycle 15: (17, 4, 11, 0)
- Cycle 16: (17, 4, 13, 12)
- Cycle 17: (17, 2, 1, 8)
- Cycle 18: (17, 2, 13, 12)
- Cycle 19: (6, 5, 17, 2)
- Cycle 20: (7, 5, 9, 14)
- Cycle 21: (7, 5, 17, 4)
- Cycle 22: (7, 5, 17, 15)
- Cycle 23: (7, 5, 0, 14)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

Chordal 4-cycles found:
<5, 9, 14, 10>, with chord (9, 14)
<5, 17, 4, 13>, with chord (17, 4)
<5, 0, 11, 3>, with chord (0, 11)
<14, 10, 8, 1>, with chord (10, 8)
<15, 17, 4, 13>, with chord (17, 4)
<17, 2, 1, 8>, with chord (2, 8)
<6, 5, 17, 2>, with chord (5, 17)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

The number of unique chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [7].
