Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 3) (5, 7) (9, 5) (9, 7) (9, 0) (6, 4) (6, 0) (4, 6) (4, 7) (4, 0) (4, 3) (4, 1) (7, 5) (7, 9) (7, 4) (7, 2) (7, 1) (7, 8) (8, 7) (8, 2) (8, 0) (8, 1) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 1) (0, 9) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 8) (0, 3) (0, 1) (3, 5) (3, 4) (3, 0) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 8) (1, 2) (1, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 6, 4, 8, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 2, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 1
Node 3 is connected to node 5, 4, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 6, 7, 0, 3, and node 1
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 3, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 4, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 9, 4, 2, 1, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 2, 0, and node 1
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

There are 3 cycles of length 4 in this graph:
1. (5, 9, 7, 5)
2. (4, 7, 2, 1, 4)
3. (4, 7, 1, 8, 4)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The cycles with exactly one chord are:
- Cycle 2: (4, 7, 2, 1, 4) with a chord (2, 1)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle: <2, (2, 1)>.

Therefore, the number of unique chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
