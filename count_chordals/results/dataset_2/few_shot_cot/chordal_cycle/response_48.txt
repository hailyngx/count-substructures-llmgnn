Response:
At first step, we can identify all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: <0, 14, 15, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 14, 17, 19>
- Cycle 3: <0, 14, 13, 1>
- Cycle 4: <0, 7, 10, 19>
- Cycle 5: <1, 13, 14, 17>
- Cycle 6: <2, 9, 4, 18>
- Cycle 7: <2, 9, 19, 17>
- Cycle 8: <2, 11, 8, 7>
- Cycle 9: <3, 2, 11, 8>
- Cycle 10: <3, 5, 15, 4>
- Cycle 11: <4, 18, 7, 10>
- Cycle 12: <5, 15, 14, 0>
- Cycle 13: <6, 18, 12, 8>
- Cycle 14: <6, 16, 0, 14>
- Cycle 15: <7, 18, 4, 15>
- Cycle 16: <9, 4, 15, 5>
- Cycle 17: <9, 19, 10, 7>
- Cycle 18: <9, 2, 11, 8>
- Cycle 19: <10, 7, 0, 14>
- Cycle 20: <10, 19, 17, 14>
- Cycle 21: <11, 14, 0, 7>
- Cycle 22: <12, 18, 4, 15>
- Cycle 23: <12, 8, 11, 2>
- Cycle 24: <13, 14, 0, 7>
- Cycle 25: <14, 15, 4, 9>
- Cycle 26: <15, 5, 10, 19>
- Cycle 27: <17, 14, 0, 7>
- Cycle 28: <17, 19, 10, 5>
- Cycle 29: <18, 4, 9, 2>
- Cycle 30: <18, 7, 0, 14>

At the second step, we can check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <0, 14, 15, 5>, Chord: (14, 5)
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <0, 14, 17, 19>, Chord: (14, 19)
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <0, 14, 13, 1>, Chord: (14, 13)
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <0, 7, 10, 19>, Chord: (7, 19)
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <1, 13, 14, 17>, Chord: (13, 17)
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <2, 9, 4, 18>, Chord: (9, 18)
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <3, 5, 15, 4>, Chord: (5, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <6, 16, 0, 14>, Chord: (16, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 9: <9, 4, 15, 5>, Chord: (4, 15)
- Chordal 4-cycle 10: <9, 19, 10, 7>, Chord: (19, 10)
- Chordal 4-cycle 11: <10, 7, 0, 14>, Chord: (7, 14)
- Chordal 4-cycle 12: <11, 14, 0, 7>, Chord: (14, 7)
- Chordal 4-cycle 13: <12, 18, 4, 15>, Chord: (18, 15)
- Chordal 4-cycle 14: <13, 14, 0, 7>, Chord: (14, 7)

Finally, the number of chordless cycles found is 16, therefore [16].
