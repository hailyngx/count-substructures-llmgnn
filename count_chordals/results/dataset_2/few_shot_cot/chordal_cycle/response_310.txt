Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 0: (0, 4, 19, 6, 17, 11, 12, 1, 7, 14, 5, 9, 3)
- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 19, 6, 17, 11, 12, 1, 7, 8, 13, 3, 9)
- Cycle 2: (0, 4, 19, 17, 11, 10, 12, 1, 7, 14, 5, 9, 3)
- Cycle 3: (2, 8, 13, 3, 9, 5, 14, 7, 1, 12, 15, 17, 6)
- Cycle 4: (2, 8, 13, 3, 9, 5, 14, 7, 1, 12, 10, 11, 17)
- Cycle 5: (2, 8, 15, 17, 11, 10, 12, 1, 7, 14, 5, 9, 3)
- Cycle 6: (2, 0, 4, 19, 6, 17, 11, 12, 1, 7, 8, 13, 3)
- Cycle 7: (2, 0, 4, 19, 17, 11, 10, 12, 1, 7, 14, 5, 9)
- Cycle 8: (4, 19, 17, 11, 10, 12, 1, 7, 8, 13, 3, 9, 5)

Step 2: Checking for chords in the cycles:
- Cycle 0 has a chord: (0, 19) and (6, 17)
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (0, 19) and (7, 8)
- Cycle 2 has a chord: (0, 19) and (10, 11)
- Cycle 3 has a chord: (2, 13) and (5, 14)
- Cycle 4 is a chordal 4-cycle: <4, (10, 17), 14>
- Cycle 5 has a chord: (2, 15) and (5, 14)
- Cycle 6 has a chord: (0, 19) and (7, 8)
- Cycle 7 has a chord: (0, 19) and (14, 7)
- Cycle 8 has a chord: (4, 17) and (8, 13)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There is 1 unique chordal 4-cycle found, so the final count is [1]. 

Unique chordal 4-cycle: <4, (10, 17), 14>
