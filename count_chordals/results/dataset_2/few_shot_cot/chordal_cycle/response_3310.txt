Response:
First, let's list all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:

- <0, 7, 2, 14, 11>
- <0, 7, 2, 12, 8>
- <1, 5, 9, 6, 1>
- <1, 5, 9, 10, 14>
- <1, 5, 8, 7, 6>
- <1, 8, 12, 10, 14>
- <1, 8, 12, 4, 1>
- <1, 4, 3, 6, 1>
- <1, 4, 3, 10, 2>
- <1, 4, 11, 0, 7>
- <1, 4, 5, 9, 6>
- <1, 14, 11, 0, 7>
- <1, 14, 10, 3, 4>
- <2, 7, 6, 9, 5>
- <2, 7, 11, 0, 14>
- <2, 7, 8, 5, 1>
- <2, 12, 4, 3, 10>
- <2, 12, 8, 7, 2>
- <2, 13, 4, 1, 5>
- <2, 13, 4, 12, 10>
- <2, 14, 11, 0, 7>
- <3, 6, 9, 5, 1>
- <3, 6, 1, 5, 8>
- <3, 10, 14, 11, 0>
- <3, 10, 12, 4, 1>
- <4, 5, 9, 6, 1>
- <4, 5, 8, 7, 6>
- <4, 12, 8, 7, 6>
- <4, 12, 2, 10, 14>
- <4, 13, 2, 10, 12>
- <5, 8, 7, 6, 9>
- <5, 9, 6, 7, 8>
- <7, 6, 9, 5, 8>
- <10, 12, 8, 5, 1>
- <10, 12, 4, 1, 5>
- <11, 0, 7, 6, 9>
- <11, 0, 7, 2, 14>
- <11, 14, 10, 3, 4>

Now, let's find the chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord:

- The chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is <2, 12, 4, 1> with the chord (2, 10).

Therefore, the number of chordless cycles found is [33].
