Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <6, 9, 19, 16> with chord (9, 16).

Now, let's count the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph.

There are no chordless 4-cycles in the given graph as the only 4-cycle present has a chord.

Therefore, the final count of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [0].
