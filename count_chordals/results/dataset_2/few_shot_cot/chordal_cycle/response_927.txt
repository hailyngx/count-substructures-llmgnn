Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 7) (6, 0) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 7) (4, 9) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 2) (8, 9) (8, 4) (8, 2) (8, 3) (8, 7) (5, 2) (5, 1) (5, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 5) (2, 3) (0, 6) (0, 4) (0, 5) (0, 7) (0, 3) (0, 1) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 8) (7, 0) (1, 6) (1, 5) (1, 0) (3, 8) (3, 2) (3, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 4, 5, 7, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 5, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 5, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 8, 2, and node 0
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 8, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 2, 1, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, 7, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 6, 9, 8, and node 0
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 2, 3, and node 7
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, and node 7

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 6, 5, 1)
- Cycle 2: (0, 6, 9, 8)
- Cycle 3: (0, 6, 7, 9)
- Cycle 4: (0, 4, 9, 8)
- Cycle 5: (0, 4, 2, 8)
- Cycle 6: (0, 5, 2, 8)
- Cycle 7: (0, 3, 2, 8)
- Cycle 8: (1, 6, 9, 8)
- Cycle 9: (2, 4, 9, 8)
- Cycle 10: (2, 4, 8, 3)
- Cycle 11: (5, 2, 4, 8)
- Cycle 12: (6, 9, 8, 7)
- Cycle 13: (6, 7, 8, 9)

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <1, (5, 6), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle 2: <2, (4, 9), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 3: <3, (0, 2), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle 4: <4, (0, 8), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 5: <5, (8, 2), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle 6: <6, (0, 8), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle 7: <7, (6, 8), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle 8: <8, (6, 8), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found: [5]

(The unique chordal 4-cycle found in the graph are inside <> and each only mentioned once, with the chords enclosed in ())
