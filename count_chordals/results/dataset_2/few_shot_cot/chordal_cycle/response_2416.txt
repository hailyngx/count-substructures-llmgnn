Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: 0-1-15-9-5-8-4-6-2-12-13-11-16-3-12
- Cycle 2: 0-1-15-9-5-13-12-3-16-14-18-7-19

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Cycle 1: <0, (9, 15), 12, 13>
- Cycle 2: <0, (15, 9), 13, 12>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
As there are no chordless cycles found, the total number is [0].
