Response:
Step 1: 
- Possible 4-cycles: 
    - <1, 4, 11, 7, 1>
    - <1, 3, 7, 12, 1>
    - <1, 4, 11, 12, 1>
    - <1, 4, 5, 9, 1>
    - <3, 1, 4, 11, 3>
    - <3, 7, 12, 13, 3>
    - <3, 2, 10, 11, 3>
    - <4, 11, 7, 13, 4>
    - <4, 5, 13, 0, 4>
    - <5, 9, 14, 13, 5>

Step 2:
- Chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord (chord marked inside brackets):
    - <1, (4, 11), 7, 12, 1>
    - <1, (3, 7), 12, 11, 1>
    - <1, (4, 11), 12, 4, 1>
    - <1, (4, 5), 9, 5, 1>
    - <3, (4, 11), 7, 13, 3>
    - <3, (7, 12), 11, 4, 3>
    - <4, (11, 7), 13, 3, 4>
    - <5, (9, 14), 13, 4, 5>

Step 3:
- Total number of chordal 4-cycles: [8]
