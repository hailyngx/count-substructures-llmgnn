Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

The cycles in the graph are:
- Cycle 1: <11, 16, 7, 3>
- Cycle 2: <11, 16, 0, 19>
- Cycle 3: <11, 16, 3, 14>
- Cycle 4: <11, 16, 3, 19>
- Cycle 5: <16, 7, 12, 6>
- Cycle 6: <16, 7, 12, 8>
- Cycle 7: <16, 3, 14, 6>
- Cycle 8: <16, 3, 14, 2>
- Cycle 9: <16, 3, 19, 4>
- Cycle 10: <7, 12, 8, 10>
- Cycle 11: <7, 3, 14, 6>
- Cycle 12: <7, 3, 14, 2>
- Cycle 13: <7, 3, 19, 4>
- Cycle 14: <14, 4, 8, 15>
- Cycle 15: <14, 3, 16, 11>
- Cycle 16: <15, 8, 12, 13>
- Cycle 17: <15, 2, 14, 6>
- Cycle 18: <15, 2, 14, 3>
- Cycle 19: <15, 2, 9, 6>
- Cycle 20: <10, 1, 18, 17>
- Cycle 21: <10, 8, 15, 6>
- Cycle 22: <1, 18, 17, 13>
- Cycle 23: <18, 17, 13, 11>
- Cycle 24: <13, 17, 5, 18>
- Cycle 25: <13, 17, 5, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

The chordal 4-cycle in the graph is:
- Chordal 4-cycle 1: <11, 16, 7, 3> with chord (16, 7)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

There is 24 unique chordal 4-cycles found.

Therefore, the final answer is [24].
