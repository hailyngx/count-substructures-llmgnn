Response:
As this is a large graph, I will first identify the cycles before looking for the chordal 4-cycles.

Identified cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 4, 13, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 4, 2, 8>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 1, 7>
- Cycle 4: <1, 13, 4, 14>
- Cycle 5: <1, 13, 7, 14>
- Cycle 6: <1, 7, 11, 8>
- Cycle 7: <1, 14, 5, 3>
- Cycle 8: <2, 4, 13, 7>
- Cycle 9: <3, 5, 14, 9>
- Cycle 10: <3, 8, 12, 9>
- Cycle 11: <4, 13, 7, 12>
- Cycle 12: <7, 12, 8, 11>
- Cycle 13: <9, 14, 1, 7>
- Cycle 14: <11, 7, 13, 4>
- Cycle 15: <11, 3, 8, 12>

Upon checking for exactly one chord within each cycle, we find that the following cycles are chordal 4-cycles:
1. <0, 4, 13, 7> with chord (0, 13)
2. <0, 4, 2, 8> with chord (4, 8)
3. <0, 6, 1, 7> with chord (6, 1)
4. <1, 13, 4, 14> with chord (13, 14)
5. <1, 7, 11, 8> with chord (1, 11)
6. <2, 4, 13, 7> with chord (2, 13)
7. <3, 5, 14, 9> with chord (5, 14)
8. <3, 8, 12, 9> with chord (3, 12)

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [8].
