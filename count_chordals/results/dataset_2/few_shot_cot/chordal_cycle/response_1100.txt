Response:
In this graph, we need to identify the chordal 4-cycles. Let's start by listing all cycles of length 4:

1. <0, 5, 2, 8, 0>
2. <0, 11, 3, 4, 12, 0>
3. <0, 11, 9, 5, 0>
4. <1, 5, 9, 6, 10, 1>
5. <1, 7, 4, 9, 5, 1>
6. <2, 5, 9, 4, 3, 2>
7. <2, 8, 0, 12, 3, 2>
8. <3, 4, 7, 1, 10, 6, 14, 11, 3>
9. <4, 7, 1, 8, 2, 13, 5, 9, 4>
10. <4, 7, 1, 8, 12, 3, 2, 5, 4>
11. <4, 9, 6, 14, 11, 3, 12, 0, 8, 2, 5, 13, 2>
12. <5, 9, 6, 14, 11, 3, 12, 0, 8, 1>

Now, let's identify the unique chordal 4-cycles (with exactly one chord):

1. <0, 11, 9, 5, 0> has a chord 5-9
2. <1, 7, 4, 9, 5, 1> has a chord 4-5
3. <4, 7, 1, 8, 2, 13, 5, 9, 4> has a chord 1-5
4. <4, 9, 6, 14, 11, 3, 12, 0, 8, 2, 5, 13, 2> has a chord 2-9
5. <5, 9, 6, 14, 11, 3, 12, 0, 8, 1> has a chord 1-9

There are 5 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [5].
