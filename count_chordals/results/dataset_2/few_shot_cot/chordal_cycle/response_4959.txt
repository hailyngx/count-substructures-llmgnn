Response:
Step 1: The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are:
1. <7, 4, 14, 17>
2. <7, 11, 22, 24>
3. <18, 15, 13, 20>
4. <18, 21, 19, 5>
5. <22, 11, 6, 7>
6. <22, 24, 26, 28>
7. <14, 17, 25, 8>
8. <14, 3, 9, 22>
9. <14, 16, 13, 15>
10. <17, 25, 11, 7>
11. <21, 19, 5, 8>
12. <21, 22, 9, 24>
13. <15, 13, 16, 14>
14. <20, 13, 15, 18>
15. <13, 16, 23, 12>
16. <16, 14, 3, 9>
17. <16, 23, 27, 29>
18. <25, 17, 14, 4>
19. <25, 8, 18, 21>
20. <25, 11, 6, 7>
21. <25, 8, 5, 19>
22. <0, 28, 26, 24>
23. <10, 16, 14, 3>
24. <10, 19, 21, 18>
25. <2, 7, 11, 8>
26. <2, 19, 5, 8>
27. <2, 23, 27, 29>
28. <11, 7, 2, 19>
29. <11, 25, 17, 14>
30. <11, 8, 25, 17>
31. <3, 18, 21, 22>
32. <3, 14, 4, 7>
33. <3, 9, 22, 21>
34. <3, 23, 27, 29>
35. <27, 23, 12, 5>
36. <27, 29, 9, 24>

Step 2: The cycles with exactly one chord (chordal 4-cycles) are:
1.  <14, 3, 9, 22, (16, 14)>
2.  <14, 16, 13, 15, (3, 9)>
3.  <25, 11, 6, 7, (8, 25)>
4.  <25, 8, 5, 19, (11, 6)>
5.  <2, 7, 11, 8, (19, 5)>
6.  <2, 19, 5, 8, (7, 11)>
7.  <2, 23, 27, 29, (16, 3)>
8.  <21, 19, 5, 8, (2, 11)>

Step 3: There are 8 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [8].
