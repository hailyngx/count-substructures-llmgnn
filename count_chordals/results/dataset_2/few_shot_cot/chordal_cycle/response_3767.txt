Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 8) (9, 6) (9, 8) (9, 4) (9, 2) (9, 7) (9, 0) (1, 6) (1, 3) (1, 2) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 1) (3, 0) (3, 4) (0, 9) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 2) (0, 7) (0, 4) (2, 9) (2, 1) (2, 0) (2, 4) (7, 9) (7, 0) (7, 8) (8, 6) (8, 9) (8, 1) (8, 7) (8, 5) (5, 8) (4, 9) (4, 3) (4, 0) (4, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 9, 1, 3, 2, 7, and node 4
Node 1 is connected to node 6, 3, 2, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 1, 0, and node 4
Node 3 is connected to node 1, 0, and node 4
Node 4 is connected to node 9, 3, 0, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 8
Node 6 is connected to node 9, 1, and node 8
Node 7 is connected to node 9, 0, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 6, 9, 1, 7, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 6, 8, 4, 2, 7, and node 0

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:
- Node 0 -> Node 9 -> Node 4 -> Node 3 -> Node 0 (4-cycle)
- Node 0 -> Node 1 -> Node 3 -> Node 4 -> Node 0 (4-cycle)
- Node 0 -> Node 2 -> Node 4 -> Node 9 -> Node 0 (4-cycle)
- Node 0 -> Node 3 -> Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 0 (4-cycle)
- Node 0 -> Node 4 -> Node 9 -> Node 6 -> Node 1 -> Node 0 (5-cycle)

Step 2: Check for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- The 4-cycle Node 0 -> Node 9 -> Node 4 -> Node 3 -> Node 0 has a chord: (Node 9, Node 3)
- The 4-cycle Node 0 -> Node 1 -> Node 3 -> Node 4 -> Node 0 has a chord: (Node 1, Node 4)
- The 4-cycle Node 0 -> Node 2 -> Node 4 -> Node 9 -> Node 0 has a chord: (Node 2, Node 9)
- The 4-cycle Node 0 -> Node 3 -> Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 0 does not have a chord

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- There is 1 chordless 4-cycle

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the given graph is [1].

The unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 3, 1, 2>.
