Response:
Step 1: 
There are multiple cycles of length 4 in the graph: 
<0, 5, 14, 1, 0>
<0, 5, 8, 7, 2, 0>
<0, 9, 13, 6, 0>
<0, 9, 12, 4, 1, 0>
<1, 4, 12, 7, 2, 1>
<1, 4, 3, 9, 13, 1>
<2, 7, 12, 4, 2>
<2, 7, 8, 5, 10, 2>
<3, 7, 12, 4, 3>
<3, 7, 2, 13, 9, 3>
<5, 8, 7, 3, 14, 5>
<5, 8, 2, 6, 10, 5>
<6, 10, 2, 7, 12, 6>
<9, 12, 7, 3, 14, 9>

Step 2:
Examining the cycles above, we find that the following cycle has exactly one chord:
Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 9, 13, 6, 0> with chord (9, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have only found 1 chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord.

Therefore, the final count is [1].
