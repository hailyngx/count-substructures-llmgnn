- <1, 3, 15, 14> has chord (3, 15)
- <1, 3, 13, 6> has chord (3, 13)
- <1, 3, 13, 16> has chord (3, 13)
- <1, 4, 7, 17> has chord (4, 7)
- <1, 4, 7, 19> has chord (4, 7)
- <1, 4, 16, 13> has chord (4, 16)
- <1, 5, 7, 17> has chord (5, 7)
- <1, 5, 7, 19> has chord (5, 7)
- <1, 5, 11, 17> has chord (5, 11)
- <2, 16, 13, 6> has chord (2, 16)
- <3, 13, 16, 4> has chord (13, 16)
- <3, 13, 17, 7> has chord (13, 17)
- <3, 15, 14, 10> has chord (15, 14)

- <9, 14, 12, 8> has chord (14, 12)
- <9, 16, 13, 3> has chord (16, 13)
- <10, 19, 5, 1> has chord (19, 5)
- <11, 17, 13, 3> has chord (17, 13)
- <11, 17, 18, 0> has chord (17, 18)
- <11, 5, 1, 3> has chord (5, 1)
- <12, 14, 15, 3> has chord (14, 15)
