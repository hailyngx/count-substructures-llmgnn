Node 6 is connected to node 5, 10, 2, and node 12
Node 7 is connected to node 1, 4, 11, 10, and node 14
Node 8 is connected to node 9, 4, 10, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 8, 4, and node 11
Node 10 is connected to node 6, 8, 7, and node 0
Node 11 is connected to node 9, 13, 7, 0, and node 2
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 6, 8, 4, 0, and node 14
Node 13 is connected to node 1, and node 11
Node 14 is connected to node 1, 3, 7, and node 12

Response:
Based on the given graph, the unique chordal 4-cycle is as follows: 
1. <1, 4, 7, 14> 

Therefore, the number of chordless 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
