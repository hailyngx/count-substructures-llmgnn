Step 2:
Now, we check each cycle for exactly one chord. The chordal cycles are:
- <0, 20, 3, 9> (Chord: (3, 20))
- <0, 21, 11, 18> (Chord: (11, 18))
- <1, 26, 7, 12> (Chord: (7, 26))
- <4, 25, 3, 20> (Chord: (3, 25))
- <5, 20, 0, 1> (Chord: (0, 20))
- <8, 26, 1, 0> (Chord: (0, 1))
- <9, 26, 1, 0> (Chord: (1, 26))
- <13, 12, 7, 26> (Chord: (7, 12))
- <18, 7, 26, 9> (Chord: (7, 26))
- <21, 22, 9, 26> (Chord: (9, 22))
- <23, 22, 9, 26> (Chord: (9, 22))
- <25, 16, 13, 12> (Chord: (12, 13))
- <28, 18, 19, 17> (Chord: (18, 19))

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 129 cycles - 11 chordal cycles = 118 chordless cycles.

Therefore, the final answer is [118].
