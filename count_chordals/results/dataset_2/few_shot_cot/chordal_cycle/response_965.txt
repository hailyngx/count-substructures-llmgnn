Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 2, 4, 5>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 19, 18>
- Cycle 3: <2, 4, 19, 18>
- Cycle 4: <2, 8, 16, 5>
- Cycle 5: <3, 0, 12, 14>
- Cycle 6: <4, 5, 7, 9>
- Cycle 7: <6, 3, 19, 4>
- Cycle 8: <6, 10, 19, 4>
- Cycle 9: <6, 12, 14, 15>
- Cycle 10: <7, 5, 16, 11>
- Cycle 11: <8, 2, 4, 19>
- Cycle 12: <8, 11, 16, 5>
- Cycle 13: <9, 7, 5, 16>
- Cycle 14: <10, 6, 17, 19>
- Cycle 15: <12, 0, 2, 4>
- Cycle 16: <12, 6, 19, 4>
- Cycle 17: <12, 14, 1, 16>
- Cycle 18: <14, 1, 16, 5>
- Cycle 19: <14, 15, 5, 7>
- Cycle 20: <18, 0, 3, 6>
- Cycle 21: <18, 19, 4, 5>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <0, 2, 4, 5>, Chord: (0, 4)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, 10, 19, 4>, Chord: (6, 19)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <7, 5, 16, 11>, Chord: (5, 11)
- Chordal 4-cycle: <18, 19, 4, 5>, Chord: (19, 5)

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 17 chordless 4-cycles in the given graph.

Therefore, the final count is [17].
