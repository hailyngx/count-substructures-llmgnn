Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- The cycles in the graph are: 
  - Cycle 1: <0, 3, 12, 6>
  - Cycle 2: <0, 3, 4, 2>
  - Cycle 3: <0, 5, 8, 14>
  - Cycle 4: <0, 5, 6, 7>
  - Cycle 5: <0, 2, 16, 7>
  - Cycle 6: <0, 11, 10, 15, 1>
  - Cycle 7: <0, 11, 10, 14>
  - Cycle 8: <0, 11, 19, 10>
  - Cycle 9: <2, 4, 6, 5>
  - Cycle 10: <2, 4, 3, 0>
  - Cycle 11: <2, 16, 7, 6>
  - Cycle 12: <4, 2, 16, 7>
  - Cycle 13: <5, 8, 13, 17>
  - Cycle 14: <5, 6, 12, 3>
  - Cycle 15: <6, 7, 10, 11>
  - Cycle 16: <7, 10, 14, 17>
  - Cycle 17: <10, 11, 19, 10>
  - Cycle 18: <14, 15, 1, 15>
  - Cycle 19: <14, 15, 10, 11>
  - Cycle 20: <14, 15, 10, 19, 11>
  - Cycle 21: <14, 17, 13, 8>
  - Cycle 22: <14, 17, 8, 5>
  - Cycle 23: <14, 17, 13, 8>
  - Cycle 24: <14, 17, 8, 18, 7>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
- Only Cycle 6: <0, 11, 10, 15, 1> has exactly one chord (10, 15).

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- The number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
