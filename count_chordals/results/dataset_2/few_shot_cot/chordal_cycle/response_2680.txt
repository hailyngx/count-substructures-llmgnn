Response:
The graph described has 30 nodes and 90 edges. 

Following the steps to count the number of chordal 4-cycles:

Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more:
- There are many cycles in the graph, but we will only list chordal 4-cycles:
1. <11, 16, 22, 3> with chord (16, 3)
2. <11, 16, 23, 1> with chord (16, 1)
3. <11, 16, 23, 12> with chord (16, 12)
4. <11, 16, 9, 27> with chord (16, 9)
5. <11, 13, 15, 2> with chord (13, 2)
6. <16, 22, 3, 8> with chord (22, 8)
7. <16, 22, 3, 11> with chord (22, 11)
8. <16, 9, 27, 21> with chord (9, 21)
9. <13, 15, 20, 12> with chord (15, 12)
10. <3, 11, 13, 15> with chord (11, 15)
11. <5, 11, 16, 22> with chord (11, 22)
12. <5, 29, 20, 15> with chord (29, 15)
13. <0, 7, 26, 1> with chord (7, 1)
14. <0, 5, 29, 20> with chord (5, 20)
15. <0, 6, 1, 26> with chord (6, 26)
16. <0, 6, 24, 17> with chord (6, 17)
17. <0, 18, 21, 27> with chord (18, 27)
18. <12, 20, 29, 5> with chord (20, 5)
19. <12, 23, 1, 26> with chord (23, 26)
20. <27, 21, 18, 0> with chord (21, 0)
21. <1, 23, 12, 20> with chord (23, 20)
22. <2, 15, 20, 17> with chord (15, 17)
23. <10, 12, 23, 1> with chord (12, 1)
24. <10, 19, 25, 6> with chord (19, 6)

Step 2: Checking each cycle for exactly one chord.
A chordal 4-cycle has exactly one chord.

Step 3: Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found.
There are 24 unique chordal 4-cycles found in the graph. So, the final count is given as [24].
