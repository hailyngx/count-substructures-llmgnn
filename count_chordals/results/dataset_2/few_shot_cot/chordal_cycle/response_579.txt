2. <1, 10, 19, 11>
3. <1, 10, 14, 15>
4. <3, 1, 10, 19>
5. <3, 11, 19, 18>
6. <3, 11, 18, 13>
7. <10, 1, 3, 9>
8. <10, 1, 8, 17>
9. <10, 19, 4, 16>
10. <17, 8, 1, 3>
11. <17, 15, 14, 10>

17. <12, 16, 4, 19>
18. <0, 12, 16, 13>
19. <0, 6, 7, 8>
20. <0, 6, 2, 15>
21. <14, 10, 1, 3>
22. <14, 15, 17, 13>
23. <11, 3, 1, 10>
24. <11, 18, 13, 17>
25. <11, 18, 19, 10>
26. <13, 17, 8, 1>
27. <13, 18, 19, 4>
28. <13, 16, 4, 19>
29. <13, 15, 2, 6>
30. <16, 7, 8, 17>
31. <16, 13, 18, 19>
32. <18, 11, 3, 1>
33. <18, 11, 19, 4>
34. <18, 13, 17, 15>

42. <8, 1, 3, 11>
43. <8, 17, 15, 14>
44. <8, 7, 16, 12>
45. <8, 6, 7, 16>
46. <6, 7, 16, 4>
47. <6, 0, 12, 16>
48. <6, 2, 15, 17>
49. <2, 15, 14, 10>
50. <4, 16, 7, 8>

Step 2:
Among these cycles, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is:
<1, 3, 11, 19, (10, 18)>

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found, we have 50 chordless cycles.

Putting this final number inside brackets, we get the answer as [50].
