Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Chord in <1, 3, 6, 8>: (3, 6)
- Chord in <3, 1, 18, 8>: (1, 18)
- Chord in <4, 5, 15, 1>: (5, 15)
- Chord in <5, 12, 7, 1>: (12, 7)
- Chord in <8, 9, 6, 3>: (9, 3)
- Chord in <9, 10, 11, 3>: (10, 11)
- Chord in <13, 15, 5, 4>: (15, 5)
- Chord in <17, 9, 6, 3>: (9, 6)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles found = [54]
