Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 12) (5, 4) (5, 0) (5, 7) (9, 4) (9, 10) (9, 0) (4, 5) (4, 9) (4, 7) (4, 3) (4, 11) (7, 5) (7, 4) (7, 10) (7, 14) (7, 8) (1, 3) (1, 11) (1, 2) (1, 14) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (8, 7) (8, 13) (8, 2) (8, 12) (13, 8) (13, 11) (13, 0) (2, 1) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 12) (2, 11) (0, 5) (0, 9) (0, 13) (0, 11) (0, 6) (12, 5) (12, 8) (12, 2) (12, 10) (12, 11) (11, 4) (11, 1) (11, 13) (11, 2) (11, 0) (11, 12) (14, 7) (14, 1) (14, 6) (6, 0) (6, 14) (10, 9) (10, 7) (10, 12) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 5, 9, 13, 11, and node 6
Node 1 is connected to node 3, 11, 2, and node 14
Node 2 is connected to node 1, 3, 8, 12, and node 11
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, and node 2
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 9, 7, 3, and node 11
Node 5 is connected to node 12, 4, 0, and node 7
Node 6 is connected to node 0, and node 14
Node 7 is connected to node 5, 4, 10, 14, and node 8
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 13, 2, and node 12
Node 9 is connected to node 4, 10, and node 0
Node 10 is connected to node 9, 7, and node 12
Node 11 is connected to node 4, 1, 13, 2, 0, and node 12
Node 12 is connected to node 5, 8, 2, 10, and node 11
Node 13 is connected to node 8, 11, and node 0
Node 14 is connected to node 7, 1, and node 6

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 4, 3, 1>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 4, 7, 14, 6>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle):
- Cycle 1 has a chord: (1, 3)
- Cycle 2 does not have a chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
- We found 1 chordless cycle.

So, the final answer is [1], and the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <0, 5, 4, 7, 14, 6>.
