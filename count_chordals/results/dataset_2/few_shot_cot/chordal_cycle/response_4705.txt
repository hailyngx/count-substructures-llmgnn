Prompt:
This graph has 20 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (3, 15) (3, 17) (3, 6) (3, 9) (15, 3) (15, 18) (14, 8) (14, 7) (14, 12) (17, 3) (17, 19) (5, 6) (5, 13) (5, 8) (5, 18) (5, 0) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 13) (6, 16) (4, 18) (4, 9) (4, 10) (18, 15) (18, 5) (18, 4) (18, 0) (0, 5) (0, 18) (0, 12) (2, 12) (2, 11) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (1, 16) (1, 9) (1, 8) (8, 14) (8, 5) (8, 1) (9, 3) (9, 4) (9, 1) (7, 14) (7, 16) (7, 11) (7, 19) (16, 6) (16, 1) (16, 7) (12, 14) (12, 0) (12, 2) (11, 2) (11, 13) (11, 7) (19, 17) (19, 7) (10, 4) 
Adjacency list for each node:

Node 16 is connected to node 6, 1, and node 7
Node 17 is connected to node 3, and node 19
Node 18 is connected to node 15, 5, 4, and node 0
Node 19 is connected to node 17, and node 7

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle found in this graph is <3, 15, 18, 5> with a chord between nodes 3 and 18. 

Since there is only one chordal 4-cycle found, the final count of chordless cycles is [0].
