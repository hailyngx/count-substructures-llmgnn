Response:
Step 1: 
Potential cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle <0, 3, 1, 2> with edges (0, 3), (3, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 0)
- Cycle <0, 3, 5, 10> with edges (0, 3), (3, 5), (5, 10), and (10, 0)
- Cycle <2, 4, 7, 11> with edges (2, 4), (4, 7), (7, 11), and (11, 2)
- Cycle <2, 5, 12, 13> with edges (2, 5), (5, 12), (12, 13), and (13, 2)
- Cycle <3, 5, 10, 13> with edges (3, 5), (5, 10), (10, 13), and (13, 3)
- Cycle <7, 10, 13, 4> with edges (7, 10), (10, 13), (13, 4), and (4, 7)
- Cycle <8, 11, 3, 1> with edges (8, 11), (11, 3), (3, 1), and (1, 8)
  
Step 2: 
Chordal 4-cycles found:
- Chordal 4-cycle <0, 3, 1, 2> with chord (0, 1)
- Chordal 4-cycle <3, 5, 10, 13> with chord (3, 10)

Step 3:
Total number of chordless 4-cycles: [5]
