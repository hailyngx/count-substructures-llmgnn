Step 2:
From the list above, we can identify the chordal 4-cycles as follows:
1. Chordal 4-cycle <0, 1, 15, 6> with chord (0, 15)
2. Chordal 4-cycle <0, 18, 14, 4> with chord (0, 14)
3. Chordal 4-cycle <0, 19, 12, 17> with chord (0, 12)
4. Chordal 4-cycle <0, 18, 14, 11> with chord (0, 14)
5. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 0, 18, 14> with chord (1, 18)
6. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 6, 7, 13> with chord (1, 7)
7. Chordal 4-cycle <1, 6, 7, 16> with chord (1, 16)
8. Chordal 4-cycle <2, 11, 17, 5> with chord (2, 17)
9. Chordal 4-cycle <2, 0, 18, 14> with chord (2, 18)
10. Chordal 4-cycle <5, 10, 16, 8> with chord (5, 16)
11. Chordal 4-cycle <5, 12, 19, 3> with chord (5, 19)
12. Chordal 4-cycle <6, 13, 7, 16> with chord (6, 7)
13. Chordal 4-cycle <6, 1, 15, 1> with chord (6, 15)
14. Chordal 4-cycle <7, 16, 8, 3> with chord (7, 8)
15. Chordal 4-cycle <8, 8, 18, 14> with chord (8, 18)
16. Chordal 4-cycle <10, 16, 8, 18> with chord (10, 8)
17. Chordal 4-cycle <11, 17, 12, 9> with chord (11, 12)
18. Chordal 4-cycle <11, 14, 7, 6> with chord (11, 7)
19. Chordal 4-cycle <12, 9, 17, 11> with chord (12, 17)
20. Chordal 4-cycle <13, 4, 14, 18> with chord (13, 14)
