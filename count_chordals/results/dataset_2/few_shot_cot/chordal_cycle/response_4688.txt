Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 1) (4, 6) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 6) (7, 9) (7, 1) (6, 4) (6, 7) (6, 9) (6, 1) (6, 0) (9, 7) (9, 6) (9, 2) (9, 1) (1, 4) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 3) (3, 4) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 8) (8, 4) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 6) (0, 8) (0, 2) (0, 5) (5, 0) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 6, 8, 2, and node 5
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 7, 6, 9, and node 3
Node 2 is connected to node 9, 3, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 1, 2, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 1, 6, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 4, 7, 9, 1, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 6, 9, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 4, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 7, 6, 2, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: Listing all cycles of length 4 or more with existing edges:
- Cycle 1: <1, 6, 4, 7, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 6, 9, 7, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 4, 8, 3, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 4, 7, 9, 1>
- Cycle 5: <1, 4, 6, 9, 1>
- Cycle 6: <9, 6, 4, 7, 9>
- Cycle 7: <9, 6, 1, 7, 9>
- Cycle 8: <9, 7, 4, 8, 9>
- Cycle 9: <9, 7, 6, 1, 9>
- Cycle 10: <9, 7, 4, 6, 9>
- Cycle 11: <4, 7, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle 12: <4, 7, 6, 1, 4>
- Cycle 13: <4, 6, 1, 7, 4>
- Cycle 14: <4, 6, 9, 7, 4>

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- Cycle 1 has one chord: (4, 7)
- Cycle 2 has one chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 3 has one chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 4 has one chord: (4, 9)
- Cycle 5 has one chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 6 has one chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 7 has one chord: (6, 1)
- Cycle 8 has one chord: (4, 8)
- Cycle 9 has one chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 10 has one chord: (9, 7)
- Cycle 11 has one chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 12 has one chord: (4, 6)
- Cycle 13 has one chord: (6, 7)
- Cycle 14 has one chord: (4, 7)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are no chordless cycles found in this graph.

Therefore, the total number of chordal 4-cycles in this graph is [14].
