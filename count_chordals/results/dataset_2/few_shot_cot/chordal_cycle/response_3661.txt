Response:
Step 1: 
All cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle <0, 9, 2, 7>
- Cycle <0, 9, 6, 1>
- Cycle <0, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle <0, 9, 6, 8>
- Cycle <0, 3, 4, 5>
- Cycle <0, 3, 4, 8>
- Cycle <0, 3, 8, 5>
- Cycle <0, 2, 7, 5>
- Cycle <1, 6, 9, 0>
- Cycle <1, 6, 9, 8>
- Cycle <1, 6, 8, 5>
- Cycle <1, 9, 8, 5>
- Cycle <1, 9, 8, 4>
- Cycle <1, 9, 0, 3>
- Cycle <2, 9, 6, 4>
- Cycle <2, 9, 6, 8>
- Cycle <2, 9, 0, 3>
- Cycle <2, 9, 1, 6>
- Cycle <3, 4, 5, 7>
- Cycle <3, 4, 8, 5>
- Cycle <3, 4, 8, 6>
- Cycle <4, 6, 1, 9>
- Cycle <4, 6, 1, 5>
- Cycle <4, 6, 8, 5>
- Cycle <5, 7, 2, 9>
- Cycle <5, 7, 2, 0>
- Cycle <5, 8, 4, 3>
- Cycle <5, 8, 4, 6>
- Cycle <6, 1, 9, 0>
- Cycle <6, 1, 5, 7>
- Cycle <6, 4, 5, 7>
- Cycle <8, 5, 7, 2>
- Cycle <8, 5, 4, 6>
- Cycle <8, 6, 4, 3>
- Cycle <8, 6, 4, 5>
- Cycle <9, 0, 3, 4>
- Cycle <9, 0, 3, 8>
- Cycle <9, 8, 4, 6>
  
Step 2:
Out of the listed cycles, the following chordal 4-cycles have exactly one chord:
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (6, 8), 9>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (6, 9), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (8, 5), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (9, 8), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <1, (9, 0), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (6, 8), 5>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <4, (6, 9), 8>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (8, 4), 3>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <5, (8, 6), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (1, 9), 0>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <6, (4, 5), 7>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (5, 7), 2>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <8, (5, 4), 6>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (0, 3), 4>
- Chordal 4-cycle: <9, (8, 4), 6>
  
Step 3:
Counting the number of chordless cycles, we have found a total of [16] unique chordal 4-cycles.
