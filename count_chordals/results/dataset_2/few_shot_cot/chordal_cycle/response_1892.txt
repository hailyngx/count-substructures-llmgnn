Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more:
- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 4, 8, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 1, 2, 6, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 1, 2, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 8, 6, 9, 7, 0>
- Cycle 6: <1, 5, 4, 8, 6, 2, 1>
- Cycle 7: <1, 5, 4, 8, 6, 9, 2, 1>
- Cycle 8: <2, 6, 8, 4, 5, 1, 2>
- Cycle 9: <2, 6, 9, 5, 4, 8, 2>
- Cycle 10: <3, 9, 5, 4, 8, 0, 7, 3>

Step 2:
Identifying cycles with exactly one chord:
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 1, 2, 6, 0> - Chord: (1, 6)
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 1, 2, 9, 6, 0> - Chord: (1, 9)

Step 3:
Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [2]

Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
- <0, 5, 1, 2, 6, 0>
- <0, 5, 1, 2, 9, 6, 0>
