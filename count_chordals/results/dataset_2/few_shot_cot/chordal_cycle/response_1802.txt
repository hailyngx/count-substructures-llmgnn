Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 8) (4, 0) (4, 5) (4, 1) (4, 2) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 5) (8, 4) (8, 5) (5, 4) (5, 7) (5, 8) (5, 6) (5, 1) (5, 3) (6, 5) (6, 1) (6, 2) (0, 4) (0, 2) (0, 3) (0, 1) (2, 4) (2, 6) (2, 0) (2, 9) (2, 3) (9, 2) (9, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (1, 0) (3, 7) (3, 5) (3, 0) (3, 2) (3, 9) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 2, 3, and node 1
Node 1 is connected to node 4, 5, 6, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 6, 0, 9, and node 3
Node 3 is connected to node 7, 5, 0, 2, and node 9
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 8, 0, 5, 1, and node 2
Node 5 is connected to node 4, 7, 8, 6, 1, and node 3
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 1, and node 2
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 5
Node 8 is connected to node 4, and node 5
Node 9 is connected to node 2, and node 3

Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more:

1. (4, 5, 1, 0, 4)
2. (4, 0, 2, 4)
3. (4, 0, 3, 9, 2, 4)
4. (4, 5, 3, 9, 2, 4)
5. (5, 4, 1, 6, 5)
6. (5, 1, 6, 2, 5)
7. (5, 4, 7, 3, 5)
8. (5, 8, 4, 7, 5)
9. (5, 8, 4, 0, 5)
10. (5, 3, 0, 2, 5)
11. (5, 7, 4, 8, 5)
12. (0, 4, 7, 3, 0)
13. (0, 3, 9, 2, 0)
14. (2, 4, 1, 6, 2)
15. (2, 4, 0, 3, 2)
16. (2, 6, 1, 5, 2)
17. (2, 9, 3, 0, 2)
18. (7, 4, 8, 5, 7)
19. (1, 4, 7, 5, 1)
20. (1, 4, 0, 3, 1)
21. (1, 5, 3, 9, 1)

Step 2: Find the chordal 4-cycles:
    <1, (9, 3), 5>
    <2, (0, 3), 4>
    <5, (4, 8), 7>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
