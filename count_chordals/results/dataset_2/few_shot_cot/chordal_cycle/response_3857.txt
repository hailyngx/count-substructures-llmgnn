Prompt:
This graph has 15 nodes and 60 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 13) (5, 3) (5, 10) (5, 7) (5, 14) (9, 5) (9, 12) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 12) (6, 4) (6, 13) (10, 5) (10, 0) (10, 7) (10, 1) (10, 14) (11, 13) (11, 4) (4, 6) (4, 11) (4, 8) (4, 12) (4, 14) (4, 2) (8, 4) (8, 12) (8, 3) (8, 1) (8, 7) (0, 10) (0, 13) (14, 5) (14, 10) (14, 4) (13, 5) (13, 6) (13, 11) (13, 0) (7, 5) (7, 10) (7, 8) (7, 2) (12, 9) (12, 6) (12, 4) (12, 8) (12, 3) (1, 6) (1, 10) (1, 8) (3, 5) (3, 8) (3, 12) (3, 2) (2, 6) (2, 4) (2, 7) (2, 3)

Response:
The unique chordal 4-cycle in the given graph is <5, 9, 12, 6>. 

Following the steps provided, we can count the number of chordal 4-cycles:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more
- Cycle 1: (5, 9, 12, 6, 5) with chord (9, 6).
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord
- Cycle 1 has exactly one chord (9, 6).
Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found
- There are 0 chordless cycles found.

Therefore, the final count of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [1].
