Response:
Step 1: List of cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
        - <3, 15, 14, 7>
        - <3, 15, 18, 4>
        - <3, 14, 9, 0>
        - <15, 18, 4, 19>
        - <15, 14, 7, 11>
        - <15, 17, 11, 4>
        - <2, 9, 14, 7>
        - <2, 13, 1, 12>
        - <5, 6, 14, 7>
        - <5, 14, 9, 0>
        - <5, 16, 12, 1>
        - <5, 16, 10, 6>
        - <6, 14, 7, 11>

        - <15, 17, 11, 4> (Chord: (17, 4))
        - <2, 9, 14, 7> (Chord: (9, 14))
        - <2, 13, 1, 12> (Chord: (13, 1))
        - <5, 6, 14, 7> (Chord: (6, 14))

        - <5, 16, 12, 1> (Chord: (12, 1))
        - <5, 16, 10, 6> (Chord: (16, 10))
        - <6, 14, 7, 11> (Chord: (14, 7))
        - <6, 4, 18, 15> (Chord: (4, 18))
        - <6, 4, 19, 5> (Chord: (4, 19))
        - <6, 4, 11, 17> (Chord: (4, 17))
        - <6, 12, 16, 10> (Chord: (12, 16))
        - <6, 12, 1, 13> (Chord: (12, 1))
        - <4, 18, 15, 17> (Chord: (18, 17))
        - <4, 19, 5, 16> (Chord: (19, 5))
        - <4, 11, 7, 13> (Chord: (11, 7))
        - <4, 11, 17, 15> (Chord: (11, 17))
        - <19, 5, 16, 12> (Chord: (5, 16))
        - <1, 13, 7, 11> (Chord: (13, 7))
        - <12, 16, 5, 19> (Chord: (16, 5))
        - <12, 16, 10, 6> (Chord: (16, 10))
        - <16, 5, 19, 4> (Chord: (5, 19))
        - <7, 14, 15, 17> (Chord: (14, 15))
        - <0, 9, 14, 15> (Chord: (9, 14))
        - <11, 17, 15, 18> (Chord: (17, 15))
