- Cycle 5: (1, 2, 10, 14, 1) with corresponding edges: (1, 2), (2, 10), (10, 14), (14, 1)
- Cycle 6: (1, 9, 14, 13, 1) with corresponding edges: (1, 9), (9, 14), (14, 13), (13, 1)
- Cycle 7: (2, 4, 11, 14, 2) with corresponding edges: (2, 4), (4, 11), (11, 14), (14, 2)
- Cycle 8: (2, 5, 13, 8, 2) with corresponding edges: (2, 5), (5, 13), (13, 8), (8, 2)
- Cycle 9: (3, 9, 14, 10, 3) with corresponding edges: (3, 9), (9, 14), (14, 10), (10, 3)
- Cycle 10: (4, 11, 8, 13, 4) with corresponding edges: (4, 11), (11, 8), (8, 13), (13, 4)
- Cycle 11: (5, 13, 14, 10, 5) with corresponding edges: (5, 13), (13, 14), (14, 10), (10, 5)
- Cycle 12: (6, 12, 7, 10, 6) with corresponding edges: (6, 12), (12, 7), (7, 10), (10, 6)

- Cycle 17: (10, 14, 11, 8, 10) with corresponding edges: (10, 14), (14, 11), (11, 8), (8, 10)

Step 2: Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <0, (1, 5), 2> has one chord (1,5)
- <0, (1, 2), 5> has one chord (1, 2)
- <0, (1, 10), 2> has one chord (1, 10)
- <1, (9, 13), 14> has one chord (9, 13)
- <2, (4, 11), 14> has one chord (4, 11)

Step 3: Counting the number of chordless cycles found:
There are 12 unique chordal 4-cycles found, so the final count is [12].
