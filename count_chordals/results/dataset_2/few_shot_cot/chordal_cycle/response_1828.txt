Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (5, 9) (5, 6) (5, 8) (5, 1) (5, 4) (9, 5) (9, 3) (9, 1) (4, 5) (4, 7) (4, 0) (7, 4) (7, 3) (7, 2) (6, 5) (6, 3) (6, 0) (1, 5) (1, 9) (1, 3) (1, 0) (1, 8) (3, 9) (3, 7) (3, 6) (3, 1) (3, 8) (8, 5) (8, 1) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 0) (2, 7) (2, 8) (2, 0) (0, 4) (0, 6) (0, 1) (0, 8) (0, 2) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 4, 6, 1, 8, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 5, 9, 3, 0, and node 8
Node 2 is connected to node 7, 8, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 9, 7, 6, 1, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 5, 7, and node 0
Node 5 is connected to node 9, 6, 8, 1, and node 4
Node 6 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 3, and node 2
Node 8 is connected to node 5, 1, 3, 2, and node 0
Node 9 is connected to node 5, 3, and node 1

Response:
Step 1: 
List of all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph:
- Cycle 1: (0, 4, 7, 2, 0)
- Cycle 2: (1, 5, 9, 3, 1)
- Cycle 3: (2, 7, 4, 5, 2)
- Cycle 4: (3, 9, 5, 6, 3)
- Cycle 5: (4, 7, 3, 9, 4)
- Cycle 6: (5, 6, 3, 1, 5)
- Cycle 7: (6, 0, 1, 5, 6)
- Cycle 8: (7, 2, 8, 3, 7)
- Cycle 9: (8, 2, 7, 4, 8)
- Cycle 10: (9, 5, 6, 0, 9)

Step 2:
Checking for exactly one chord in each cycle:
- <1, (9, 5), 3>: (1, 5, 9, 3, 1) has one chord (9, 5)
- <2, (4, 5), 7>: (2, 7, 4, 5, 2) has one chord (4, 5)
- <3, (1, 3), 9>: (3, 9, 5, 6, 3) has one chord (1, 3)
- <4, (7, 3), 9>: (4, 7, 3, 9, 4) has one chord (7, 3)
- <5, (1, 5), 9>: (5, 6, 3, 1, 5) has one chord (1, 5)
- <6, (5, 1), 9>: (6, 0, 1, 5, 6) has one chord (5, 1)
- <7, (2, 8), 4>: (7, 2, 8, 3, 7) has one chord (2, 8)
- <8, (7, 4), 3>: (8, 2, 7, 4, 8) has one chord (7, 4)
- <9, (5, 1), 3>: (9, 5, 6, 0, 9) has one chord (5, 1)

Step 3:
Counting the number of chordal 4-cycles found: [9]
