Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.
- Cycle 1: <0, 8, 19, 9, 7>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 8, 15, 19>
- Cycle 3: <0, 10, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 4: <2, 7, 4, 1, 17>
- Cycle 5: <4, 7, 2, 3, 14>
- Cycle 6: <4, 1, 17, 3, 14>
- Cycle 7: <7, 4, 16, 6, 15>
- Cycle 8: <7, 9, 19, 8, 5>
- Cycle 9: <8, 19, 9, 17, 3>
- Cycle 10: <10, 0, 8, 5, 0>
- Cycle 11: <11, 16, 4, 1, 18>
- Cycle 12: <15, 8, 0, 12, 10>
- Cycle 13: <16, 4, 14, 3, 2>
- Cycle 14: <16, 6, 15, 19, 9>
- Cycle 15: <17, 1, 4, 14, 3>
- Cycle 16: <17, 9, 7, 2, 3>
- Cycle 17: <18, 11, 16, 6, 15>
- Cycle 18: <18, 1, 4, 14, 3>
  
Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord (an edge connecting non-adjacent nodes in the cycle).
- In Cycle 1, the chord <8, 7> breaks the cycle into two 3-cycles.
- In Cycle 2, the chord <8, 5> breaks the cycle into two 3-cycles.
- In Cycle 3, the chord <8, 1> breaks the cycle into two 3-cycles.
- In Cycle 4, the chord <7, 1> breaks the cycle into two 3-cycles.
- In Cycle 5, the chord <7, 3> breaks the cycle into two 3-cycles.
- In Cycle 6, the chord <1, 3> breaks the cycle into two 3-cycles.
- No other cycles have exactly one chord.

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.
There are 12 chordless 4-cycles in the graph.

Therefore, the final count is [12].
