Response:
Step 1: 
- The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are as follows:
1. <0, 1, 2, 11>
2. <0, 1, 5, 11>
3. <0, 1, 5, 3>
4. <0, 1, 5, 7>
5. <0, 1, 0, 4>
6. <0, 4, 9, 8>
7. <0, 4, 9, 6>
8. <0, 4, 9, 13>
9. <2, 1, 5, 7>
10. <2, 1, 0, 4>
11. <3, 5, 1, 0>
12. <3, 5, 7, 12>
13. <4, 9, 6, 13>
14. <4, 9, 8, 11>
15. <5, 7, 12, 4>
16. <5, 7, 10, 13>
17. <6, 9, 8, 4>
18. <6, 9, 4, 7>
19. <6, 9, 13, 0>
20. <6, 13, 0, 1>
21. <6, 13, 0, 4>
22. <6, 13, 14, 6>
23. <7, 10, 13, 6>
24. <7, 10, 11, 6>
25. <10, 13, 6, 9>
26. <10, 13, 14, 6>
27. <11, 2, 13, 6>
28. <11, 0, 1, 5>
29. <11, 0, 4, 9>
30. <11, 0, 4, 7>
31. <11, 0, 13, 6>
32. <11, 2, 1, 5>
33. <12, 4, 9, 6>

Step 2:
- Among the cycles listed above, the unique chordal 4-cycle with exactly one chord is: 
<2, 1, 5, 7> with a chord (1, 5)

Step 3:
- The number of chordless cycles found is [32].
