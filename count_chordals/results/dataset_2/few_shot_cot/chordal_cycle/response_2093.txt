33. Cycle <9, 8, 14, 13, 11, 9>
34. Cycle <10, 15, 6, 14, 13, 3>
35. Cycle <10, 15, 6, 17, 16, 1>
36. Cycle <11, 9, 12, 18, 15, 10, 19, 5, 7, 2, 8, 14, 13>
37. Cycle <13, 14, 6, 15, 10, 19, 5, 7, 2, 8, 14>
38. Cycle <13, 14, 6, 17, 16, 1>
39. Cycle <14, 6, 15, 10, 19, 5, 7, 2, 8, 0, 4, 0>
40. Cycle <14, 6, 17, 16, 1>
41. Cycle <15, 6, 17, 16, 1>
42. Cycle <18, 15, 10, 19, 5, 7, 2, 8, 14, 13, 3>
43. Cycle <18, 15, 10, 19, 5, 7, 2, 8, 0, 4, 0>
44. Cycle <18, 15, 6, 14, 13, 11, 9, 8, 2>
45. Cycle <18, 15, 6, 17, 16, 1>

Now, let's check each cycle for exactly one chord:

- <10, 15, 6, 14, 13, 3> has one chord (15, 13)
- <10, 15, 6, 17, 16, 1> has one chord (15, 1)
- <3, 15, 6, 17, 16, 1> has one chord (15, 16)
- <18, 15, 10, 19, 5, 7, 2, 12, 18> has one chord (15, 12)
- <5, 7, 2, 8, 14, 13, 11, 9, 12, 18, 15, 10, 19, 1> has one chord (15, 18)

Therefore, the number of chordal 4-cycles in the graph is [5].
