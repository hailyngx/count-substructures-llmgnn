Response:
Step 1: 
- One cycle found: <0, 3, 4, 11, 1> with edges (0, 3), (3, 4), (4, 11), (11, 1)
- One cycle found: <0, 3, 6, 13, 12> with edges (0, 3), (3, 6), (6, 13), (13, 12)
- One cycle found: <0, 3, 12, 14, 1> with edges (0, 3), (3, 12), (12, 14), (14, 1)
- One cycle found: <0, 8, 11, 4, 3> with edges (0, 8), (8, 11), (11, 4), (4, 3)
- One cycle found: <1, 11, 3, 4, 10> with edges (1, 11), (11, 3), (3, 4), (4, 10)
- One cycle found: <1, 14, 12, 3, 0> with edges (1, 14), (14, 12), (12, 3), (3, 0)
- One cycle found: <2, 7, 4, 11, 3> with edges (2, 7), (7, 4), (4, 11), (11, 3)
- One cycle found: <2, 7, 6, 3, 12> with edges (2, 7), (7, 6), (6, 3), (3, 12)
- One cycle found: <2, 12, 14, 1, 11> with edges (2, 12), (12, 14), (14, 1), (1, 11)
- One cycle found: <2, 14, 12, 13, 6> with edges (2, 14), (14, 12), (12, 13), (13, 6)
- One cycle found: <3, 4, 7, 6, 3> with edges (3, 4), (4, 7), (7, 6), (6, 3)
- One cycle found: <3, 6, 7, 4, 3> with edges (3, 6), (6, 7), (7, 4), (4, 3)
- One cycle found: <4, 5, 9, 8, 11> with edges (4, 5), (5, 9), (9, 8), (8, 11)
- One cycle found: <4, 10, 1, 14, 12> with edges (4, 10), (10, 1), (1, 14), (14, 12)
- One cycle found: <5, 9, 13, 6, 7> with edges (5, 9), (9, 13), (13, 6), (6, 7)

Step 2:
- The cycle <0, 3, 4, 11, 1> has a chord (3, 11)
- The cycle <0, 8, 11, 4, 3> has a chord (8, 4)
- The cycle <1, 11, 3, 4, 10> has a chord (11, 4)
- The cycle <4, 5, 9, 8, 11> has a chord (5, 8)

Step 3:
- There are 4 chordal 4-cycles found, thus the count is [4].
