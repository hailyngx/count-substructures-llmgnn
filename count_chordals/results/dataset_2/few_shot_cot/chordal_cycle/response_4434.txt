Prompt:
This graph has 10 nodes and 40 edges. The edges are as follows: (4, 7) (4, 2) (4, 3) (7, 4) (7, 0) (7, 8) (7, 1) (1, 7) (1, 6) (1, 9) (1, 0) (3, 4) (3, 0) (3, 6) (3, 9) (3, 8) (5, 6) (5, 0) (6, 1) (6, 3) (6, 5) (6, 0) (2, 4) (2, 8) (2, 9) (2, 0) (8, 7) (8, 3) (8, 2) (8, 9) (0, 7) (0, 1) (0, 3) (0, 5) (0, 6) (0, 2) (9, 1) (9, 3) (9, 2) (9, 8) 
Adjacency list for each node: 
Node 0 is connected to node 7, 1, 3, 5, 6, and node 2
Node 1 is connected to node 7, 6, 9, and node 0
Node 2 is connected to node 4, 8, 9, and node 0
Node 3 is connected to node 4, 0, 6, 9, and node 8
Node 4 is connected to node 7, 2, and node 3
Node 5 is connected to node 6, and node 0
Node 6 is connected to node 1, 3, 5, and node 0
Node 7 is connected to node 4, 0, 8, and node 1
Node 8 is connected to node 7, 3, 2, and node 9
Node 9 is connected to node 1, 3, 2, and node 8

Response:
Step 1: 
The cycles of length 4 or more in the graph are: 
- Cycle 1: <0, 1, 7, 4, 2, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 3, 4, 7, 1, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 6, 5, 0>
- Cycle 4: <1, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 4, 7, 1, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 4, 3, 8, 9, 2>
- Cycle 7: <3, 4, 7, 8, 3>
- Cycle 8: <6, 1, 7, 8, 3, 6>
- Cycle 9: <6, 5, 0, 3, 6>
- Cycle 10: <6, 3, 4, 2, 9, 6>
- Cycle 11: <8, 7, 4, 3, 8>
- Cycle 12: <9, 1, 7, 4, 3, 9>
- Cycle 13: <9, 2, 4, 3, 8, 9>

Step 2:
The cycles with exactly one chord (non-adjacent edge) are:
- Unique chordal 4-cycle <0, 1, 7, 4, 2, 0>
- Unique chordal 4-cycle <0, 3, 4, 7, 1, 0>
- Unique chordal 4-cycle <2, 4, 7, 1, 2>
- Unique chordal 4-cycle <2, 4, 3, 8, 9, 2>
- Unique chordal 4-cycle <6, 1, 7, 8, 3, 6>
- Unique chordal 4-cycle <9, 1, 7, 4, 3, 9>

Step 3:
The number of chordless cycles found is [7].
