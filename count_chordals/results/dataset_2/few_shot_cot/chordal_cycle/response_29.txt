Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <0, 5, 1, 10, 0>
- Cycle 2: <0, 5, 9, 6, 0>
- Cycle 3: <0, 5, 2, 6, 0>
- Cycle 4: <0, 5, 9, 7, 12, 0>
- Cycle 5: <0, 5, 1, 11, 14, 0>
- Cycle 6: <0, 5, 9, 7, 4, 10, 0>
- Cycle 7: <1, 5, 9, 7, 4, 3, 1>
- Cycle 8: <1, 5, 9, 7, 8, 12, 10, 1>
- Cycle 9: <1, 5, 2, 6, 3, 1>
- Cycle 10: <1, 5, 2, 6, 9, 7, 4, 1>
- Cycle 11: <3, 6, 9, 7, 4, 10, 12, 8, 3>
- Cycle 12: <3, 6, 9, 7, 4, 13, 3>
- Cycle 13: <3, 6, 9, 5, 1, 11, 3>
- Cycle 14: <3, 6, 2, 5, 1, 11, 3>
- Cycle 15: <3, 6, 2, 5, 9, 7, 4, 3>
- Cycle 16: <4, 7, 9, 5, 1, 10, 4>
- Cycle 17: <4, 7, 9, 5, 2, 6, 4>
- Cycle 18: <4, 7, 9, 5, 1, 11, 14, 12, 4>
- Cycle 19: <4, 7, 9, 5, 2, 6, 3, 1, 4>
- Cycle 20: <4, 7, 12, 10, 0, 14, 11, 1, 4>
- Cycle 21: <4, 7, 12, 10, 0, 14, 11, 3, 4>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- Unique chordal 4-cycle found: <<0, 5, 1, 10>, (7, 9)> 

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found.

- Number of chordless cycles found: [21]
