Response:
Step 1: 
List of cycles of length 4 or more: 
- Cycle 1: (4, 6, 1, 2, 4) with edges (4, 6), (6, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (4, 2), and (2, 7)
- Cycle 2: (4, 6, 3, 7, 4) with edges (4, 6), (6, 3), (3, 7), (7, 4), (4, 7), and (7, 3)
- Cycle 3: (4, 7, 0, 1, 4) with edges (4, 7), (7, 0), (0, 1), (1, 4), (4, 1), and (1, 6)
- Cycle 4: (4, 7, 3, 6, 4) with edges (4, 7), (7, 3), (3, 6), (6, 4), (4, 6), and (6, 1)
- Cycle 5: (4, 9, 0, 5, 4) with edges (4, 9), (9, 0), (0, 5), (5, 4), (4, 5), and (5, 6)
- Cycle 6: (4, 9, 7, 0, 4) with edges (4, 9), (9, 7), (7, 0), (0, 4), (4, 0), and (0, 1)
- Cycle 7: (5, 6, 1, 0, 5) with edges (5, 6), (6, 1), (1, 0), (0, 5), (5, 0), and (0, 9)
- Cycle 8: (5, 6, 8, 9, 5) with edges (5, 6), (6, 8), (8, 9), (9, 5), (5, 9), and (9, 0)
- Cycle 9: (5, 7, 0, 9, 5) with edges (5, 7), (7, 0), (0, 9), (9, 5), (5, 9), and (9, 8)
- Cycle 10: (5, 7, 4, 6, 5) with edges (5, 7), (7, 4), (4, 6), (6, 5), (5, 6), and (6, 4)
- Cycle 11: (6, 8, 5, 7, 6) with edges (6, 8), (8, 5), (5, 7), (7, 6), (6, 7), and (7, 5)
- Cycle 12: (7, 9, 0, 5, 7) with edges (7, 9), (9, 0), (0, 5), (5, 7), (7, 5), and (5, 6)

Step 2:
Checking each cycle for a chord:
- Cycle 1 has 2 chords: (2, 7) (6, 1) [0]
- Cycle 2 is chordless [1]
- Cycle 3 has 1 chord: (1, 6) [0]
- Cycle 4 has 1 chord: (6, 1) [0]
- Cycle 5 is chordless [1]
- Cycle 6 is chordless [1]
- Cycle 7 is chordless [1]
- Cycle 8 is chordless [1]
- Cycle 9 has 1 chord: (5, 9) [0]
- Cycle 10 has 1 chord: (5, 6) [0]
- Cycle 11 is chordless [1]
- Cycle 12 is chordless [1]

Step 3:
Count of chordless cycles: 6

Unique chordal 4-cycles: 
<4, 6, 3, 7>
<5, 7, 0, 9>
<5, 7, 4, 6>
