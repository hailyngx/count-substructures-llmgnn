Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists.

- Cycle 1: <1, 16, 11, 2, 1>
- Cycle 2: <1, 5, 4, 3, 17, 14, 7, 15, 10, 3, 4, 5, 1>
- Cycle 3: <1, 16, 11, 17, 14, 15, 18, 1>
- Cycle 4: <1, 5, 19, 18, 15, 10, 3, 4, 5, 1>
- Cycle 5: <2, 11, 16, 1, 5, 12, 13, 6, 2>
- Cycle 6: <2, 11, 17, 14, 7, 13, 6, 2>
- Cycle 7: <2, 6, 13, 12, 11, 17, 14, 7, 15, 18, 1, 2>
- Cycle 8: <3, 4, 5, 19, 18, 15, 10, 3>
- Cycle 9: <3, 10, 15, 7, 14, 17, 11, 2, 6, 13, 12, 5, 1, 18, 15, 10>
- Cycle 10: <4, 5, 19, 18, 1, 16, 15, 7, 14, 17, 3>
- Cycle 11: <5, 12, 11, 17, 3, 10, 15, 18, 19, 5>
- Cycle 12: <7, 14, 17, 11, 2, 6, 13, 12, 5, 19, 18, 15, 10, 3, 4, 7>
- Cycle 13: <13, 7, 15, 18, 1, 16, 11, 12, 13>
- Cycle 14: <18, 15, 7, 14, 17, 11, 12, 13, 19, 18>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord.

- From the above list, we find that only Cycle 7: <2, 6, 13, 12, 11, 17, 14, 7, 15, 18, 1, 2> has exactly one chord, which is the edge (11, 13).

Step 3: Count the number of chordal 4-cycles found.

- We found 1 unique chordal 4-cycle, therefore the final count is [1].

Thus, the unique chordal 4-cycle found is <2, 6, 13, (11, 13), 12>.
