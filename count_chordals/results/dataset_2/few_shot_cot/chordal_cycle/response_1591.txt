Response:
Step 1: List all cycles of length 4 or more in the graph ensuring that every edge in the cycle exists:
        - Cycle 1: <2, 5, 1, 7, 2>
        - Cycle 2: <2, 5, 7, 3, 2>
        - Cycle 3: <2, 5, 7, 4, 2>
        - Cycle 4: <2, 5, 7, 1, 2>
        - Cycle 5: <4, 7, 2, 5, 4>
        - Cycle 6: <4, 7, 3, 6, 4>
        - Cycle 7: <4, 7, 5, 2, 4>
        - Cycle 8: <6, 4, 7, 3, 6>
        - Cycle 9: <6, 4, 7, 5, 6>
        - Cycle 10: <7, 5, 2, 4, 7>
        - Cycle 11: <7, 5, 4, 6, 7>
        - Cycle 12: <1, 5, 2, 7, 1>
        - Cycle 13: <1, 5, 7, 4, 1>
        - Cycle 14: <1, 5, 7, 2, 1>
        - Cycle 15: <1, 3, 7, 4, 1>
        - Cycle 16: <1, 3, 7, 2, 1>
        - Cycle 17: <3, 7, 5, 4, 3>
        - Cycle 18: <3, 7, 4, 6, 3>
        - Cycle 19: <3, 7, 5, 2, 3>
        - Cycle 20: <4, 6, 9, 8, 4>
        - Cycle 21: <4, 6, 9, 0, 4>
        - Cycle 22: <0, 9, 8, 3, 0>
        - Cycle 23: <0, 9, 8, 2, 0>
        - Cycle 24: <0, 9, 6, 4, 0>

Step 2: Check each cycle for exactly one chord:
        - Unique chordal 4-cycles found:
          <2, (3, 7), 5>
          <4, (6, 7), 3>
          <6, (4, 7), 3>
          <7, (5, 4), 2>
          <1, (5, 7), 4>
          <3, (7, 4), 6>
          <9, (8, 6), 4>
          <0, (9, 8), 6>

Step 3: Count the number of chordless cycles found:
        [0]
